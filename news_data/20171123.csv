"" "" What's wrong, "" asked the father, but the son, "" Please come right now "", only said. Jeon went to the back and inside of the car to see if he had not brought a ticket for the exam, but there was nothing. Frightened, Jun made a hasty turn and headed for the main gate of Gwangju Metropolitan Office of Education, the 6th district exam site, Jeonggwang High School. When Jun arrived at the front gate, his son came to his car. Jun opened the window anxiously and called for his son. "" Junseo, why? Why? Junseo, "" the son, who did not say anything to his father's uneasy voice, came in front of the car and suddenly raised a big bow on the asphalt floor.It was the moment when the son who went to take the CSAT thanked his father. Then the father immediately stepped out of the car and patted his son on the shoulder. The situation was completely contained in Jun's car black box. Jun has edited and uploaded the video to her Facebook account. In news one and on the phone, I was surprised enough, but it was worth the effort, said Jun, saying, My father should give me a hug and give me a cheer first, but my son thanks me more.

The Abdok Kingdom began to draw attention in the 1980s when ancient tombs were unearthed in Imdang-dong and Joyeong-dong, Gyeongsan, South Gyeongsang Province. After the tomb was discovered in 1982, before the tomb robbers broke loose gold earrings, silver belts, and swords with ring bags from the second minute of Imdang-dong, the Youngnam University Museum launched a full-scale excavation.

Royal wooden tombs in Dori-ri, Hayang-eup, Gyeongsan-si, Gyeongbuk Province, where the excavated results were revealed on July 23 are about 10 kilometers from Imdang-dong. Imdang-dong is south of the Kumho River, but this tomb is located in the north of the river. However, it is estimated that the royal wooden wooden coffin tombs in the white family were larger in size and larger than the tombs in Imdang-dong. Various items of goods were poured into the tomb, including bronze mirrors, bronze daggers, iron swords, blue horse, bracelets, and flat plate iron facings. At that time, small countries were formed along the Geumhogang and Hyeongsan-gang rivers in North Gyeongsang Province, and the tombs of powerful people were discovered in Uidang-dong, Seoul, and there were about three major cities in Gyeongsan. Scholars said that similar figures were found in the Saroguk, the home of Silla in Gyeongju, and in the Tap-dong, the Tap-dong Ancient Tomb in the Gyeong-kyeong-do Plain, in order to suggest that large-scale wooden wooden wooden cottages were concentrated in nearby areas. The professor emeritus of Soongsil University, Choe Byung-hyeon, referred to the white wooden coffin tombs as the tomb of a shrubbery of burial goods in the Youngnam region, when he called the tomb a different kind of power that would have been integrated into the region.

"A fortress was discovered 3,000 years ago under Turkey's Lake Van. (Photo : YouTube) ©istor-based exploration … Conservation status : Under a lake in eastern Turkey, an ancient fortress was discovered 3,000 years ago (Daily News1). The monument is believed to be the fortress of Uratu civilization, which flourished during the 9th and 6th centuries B.C. Uratu is a civilization that was formed today across Turkey, Armenia, and Iran, known as the anti-Soviet. These days, it stretches for nearly 1km and the remaining walls reach a height of 3-4 meters. Thanks to alkaline water of the lake, the preservation is reportedly good. The site of the site is Turkey's largest lake. Local researchers at Wisen Sower University found the remains by exploring under the lake based on local superstitions. The researchers believe the lake is 600,000 years old. Tarshin Seiran, an archeologist who led the research team, "" Many civilizations and people have settled near the lake, "" they said, calling it the ' high seas. ' With this belief, we tried to solve the secret of the lake. It is a miracle to find a fortress in the water, he added, adding, Archeologists will be here to examine the history of castles and provide information.Last year, the team also found stalagmites 1.5 square miles underwater and early this year, remains of a Russian vessel believed to have sunk in 1948.British media Daily Mail reported on July 22 that a turtle swimming with a plastic bag stuck in his throat under the Red Sea. The turtle in the picture is a deadly Hawksbill turtles.As they were swimming under the sea and looking for food, they mistook the plastic bag for jellyfish and ate it. The problem is that the plastic bag is stuck in the tortoise's throat and can not eat real food.As the photographer of Bournemos University, Said Rashid (46), "" I ran into a turtle in the water, and when I approached it to take a picture, I realized something was wrong and I was praying for it. "" Soon after, Rashid approached the turtle and pulled the long plastic bag out by hand. The amazing thing is that the turtle kept quiet to help him. When he took it out, he tried to grab another plastic bag and eat it quickly. After more than 20 years as a diver, the ocean is literally covered with plastic.The scene in which Rashid saves the turtle was shown in the recent BBC marine documentary "" Blue Planet II "" (Blue Planet II). In particular, the program shocked viewers by accusing the sea of being polluted with plastic.　 　According to the United Nations Environment Programme's report ' Marine Plastic Waste and Microplastics ' last year, 4.8 million to 12.7 million tons of plastic flowed into the sea in 2010 alone. Our usual bottled water, clothing, and other daily necessities can flow into the sea to make a huge dump.Particularly problematic are tiny particles resulting from the decomposition of plastic waste, which play a major role in disturbing ecosystems. Countless creatures, such as turtles and sea birds, mistake the fragmented plastic waste as food. Of course, it ends up returning to humans through the food chain. 　Park Jong-ik : [No-News in the World] ; [Facebook] Yonhap [Seoul Newspaper] (www.seoul.co.kr), No Transporter and Redistribution ; North Korean People's Police Union ; 72 Hours old news on July 13 ; CCTV : Closed on the South Side ; Installation on the Internet Since the security forces were replaced, it is believed that commanders of the Joint Security Guard were also reprimanded. A source at the intelligence service said yesterday, After the North Korean soldiers defected via the truce village of Panmunjeom, North Korea will not be able to avoid the possibility of replacing all of its senior military units at the Joint Security Area. The replacement of the security forces is seen as a way to blame for failing to stop the Korean War on the border with North Korea. North Korea's Joint Security Area is known to have 35 to 40 soldiers, including officers. Before being replaced, the North Korean security officer fired 40 shots with pistols and AKs at defectors, one of whom was ' identified as having crossed the border with North Korea and was ' identified as having crossed the border with North Korea ' by the North Korean soldier. The defector went straight through the camp on the north side of the bridge at a speed of about 70-80 kilometers per hour and approached the MDL. The 72-hour bridge is made of concrete on Sacheon Stream, which flows through the western part of the Panmunjeom. It is said to have been built in 72 hours since the tragic incident of the Axe crime at Panmunjeom in August 1976. North Korea is also known to be showing signs of shutting down the 72-hour bridge before installing a ' gate with locks '. It is believed to be operated by the locking device to secure doors and open doors to identified soldiers and vehicles only. Meanwhile, it is known that the defectors are not part of the unit that directly guards the truce village of Panmunjeom but of the rear support unit supporting the security force. ljglory@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ The minimum ratio of applicants for the United News Channel to Starbucks coffee shot rose to 9.26 % per week from last year when the nation's first class announced its admission to the national college entrance exam.

My friends are preparing for the examination now. She died five days ago in an accident during an on-site exercise. Let's talk to Mr. Lee's father. Father, you're with me!The late Mr. Minho's father > Yes.Today is the day of the CSAT. Now that the first class is about to begin, I think you will have a different feeling for today.The late Mr. Lee's father > complicated.Where are you now?The late father Lee Min-ho is now at a funeral.I see. I know it's hard, but let me explain what happened at the time. At one water manufacturer, did Mr. Lee have hands-on experience?The late Mr. Minho's father > Yes, he is.> ☎ presenter > But when you had an accident when you were operating the compressor, who saw the accident, or who came to your side to help you?The late Lee Min-ho's father -- I mean, he comes in and tries to operate the machine when it's malfunctioning, and he's busy coming down, looking for the cause of the malfunction on the other side, and when he comes down, he's going to come under. So there was an apprentice and an employee who was at the site, but they were in a blind spot in the opposite direction. When I found him about 4 minutes after he was under pressure with the lift, he called me, and I saw a bunch of fellow trainees at the school saying, "" I don't have any friends, "" and they called me in the prayer room.Didn't you say you had one of your own staff?The late Lee Min-ho's father -- the staff didn't know about the machine, couldn't take the kids out of it, kept pressure on the factory floor, and it wasn't until about 23 minutes later that they checked the CCTVs. But it's the company that says, "" I don't know why he went under that machine, "" and it's the company that says it wrote down that on the paper that they were requesting -- and that's why he made a mistake.☎ presenter > Okay. And that's not the end of the process. But why did Mr. Minho come to you as an apprentice? Why did you have to handle the press machine alone? Isn't it a case of someone sitting next to you?The late Lee Min-ho -- yes, the original kid trainees are carried around by trained employees and safely must be. You can literally watch someone on your side or over your shoulder or see the late Lee Min-ho's father > Yeah, that's right.☎ The presenter > Little by little.Lee Min-ho -- Yes, I knew that my kid had a forklift license and drove only the forklift when he first went. And when the water comes out, they just put their feet in the basket and they drop it and they resign, and the guy in charge of the machine takes Minho out five days to get it.So, you're just leaving the date behind.I left it behind me. I don't have a word with Minho. But when the person who can touch the machine goes out, Minho takes it all over his shoulders and puts it all in his hands. Even the forklift. So when she gets home on Friday night, she sleeps until Saturday morning, because she's working out five or six on her own.What time do you usually get off work? When Minho goes to practice with his late father, Lee sometimes picks him up on Friday, and when he picks him up, the work ends at 8:30 p.m. The work is finished at half past seven. It's not until six thirty till it's over.Woman : But the intensity of the work is hard to imagine. We started with a bunch of machines, forklift, and we touched machine tools, and we touched lathe machines. But did you write down that you could do anything else on your contract?The late Lee Min-ho's father > No. The company used expediency. She has a written agreement and has a separate work agreement, and says they didn't bring in trainees, but they brought in employees. And when she was under 18, she wrote a contract for work and did not write the date or date on it without a parent's consent. The day they wrote it. They had only one copy of the contract, not even a few days away, and they had to make out two copies of it. I took all the children out and I now have the originals, and they didn't do anything wrong, and I did nothing wrong with my wife, and I did nothing but wake up in the middle of the night in the back room, and I did nothing but wake up and sleep with my own wives. I'll just do well. I'll do everything I can. That's all I had to say.Conductor : You came to the ICU and you said an apology, didn't you?The late father Lee Min-ho > No, there was no apology.I heard a lot of talk about the progressor.The late Lee Min-ho's father -- yes, I was in intensive care for 10 days when a lot of reporters came in, and I didn't want to provoke the company, so I told him not to interview me and make an issue of it. But the host > father responded with caution.The late Lee Min-ho -- Yeah, but now after the baby is out of breath, he has come to a funeral to have a funeral, and the representative has come. I don't want to tell you how to do it because I'm free, and I need you to go to the police station, tell them why you died, and it takes Minho almost 11 and half hours to get it and get it because he needs his seal stamped and then it's gone. When I called you to discuss the matter with you, I found out what happened to the shareholders ' office and they told me that Minho was going to be doing it and was in the hospital by 10:00 a.m., and you said, "" I want to know that.☎ The presenter > the company is ready to prepare quickly.The late father Lee Min-ho, or his father, or his shrewd move. It looks like they're already getting ready, a ☎ presenter > That's what it looks like. Okay. You have a lot of remaining work to do, and you have to deal with it. But since it's another funeral today, I think you should take care of yourself.Will the late Mr. Minho father > funeral service be held before the consultation? Funerals are not held for us unless they have a public apology and a fact-finding mission. How can I just bury the bitterness in the ground when I tell my son that there is something wrong with my children?☎ presenter > Okay. I hope our interview would be of some help.

"Questions remain over the release of a video clip of North Korea's defection from the United Nations four minutes before the Independence Movement Day near Panmunjeom : "" The disclosure of the North's defection is complete on July 13. South Korean military authorities observed three North Korean soldiers moving quickly from the road in front of Panmungak at 3:14 p.m. and said, "" We believe they are fleeing to the North's outpost. "" In the process, four North Korean soldiers fired 40 rounds. It was consistent with the video released by the United Nations Forces. However, the video clip was taken before Oh approached the ' 72-hour Bridge ' at 3:11 p.m. A close-up of a car's movement could indicate the observer had smelled something strange. The Korean military first appeared at 3:55 p.m. through a thermal observation device (TOD) screen operated by the military. Two Korean soldiers approached Oh and moved him to a safe place. It has been 40 minutes since Oh dumped her car and crossed the MDL. "" I could not visually verify the defectors because they were wrapped in fallen leaves, and it took me time to find them, "" said a military official. However, according to CCTV footage released at 3:43 p.m. yesterday, fallen leaves were found around Oh, but the accumulation was not so great that it was difficult to grasp. However, it took 12 minutes for the Korean military to approach the site. Eventually, the military authorities began watching the movements of the young man four minutes before he approached the DMZ at 3:11 p.m. to find out the abnormal symptoms and find it hard to guess where he was being attacked by the attack team. The video also contains no response from the Korean military except for the scene in which they secured Oh's body. Questions remain over whether military action was taken properly during the 44 minutes. In the video, the North Korean military pursuit team "" shoot on the stomach, "" or depending on the building to shoot. It may be a car park for aiming shots, but it is a South Korean military response. Of Korean troops, since there was no one soldier firing is to shooting scenes for All this open space. Unlike the North Korean military's shooting in less than five minutes, the South Korean military did nothing. Before entering the Panmunjeom, the Korean military will provide training to protect defectors and to give chase to the Korean military. They are also preparing an emergency response such as a five-minute flight. Such training and response did not come from the field of practice. [reporter Park Jong-keun] : "" I really can't do that anymore. And I can't see it. "" It was the most popular comment by Lee Guk-jong, chief of the Center for Critical Trauma at Aju University Hospital, during which he interviewed JoongAng Ilbo almost every day, from 14-22. With these complaints, I did not miss out on the words "" deeply humiliated. "" The JoongAng Ilbo had face-to-face interviews with Lee on July 15, 3 hours on July 17, and 10 hours on July 21. We chatted over the phone and over the street. When he heard the North Korean soldier's human rights issue on July 17, he raised his voice, "" How can this be? "" The whole week of interviews was filled with ' anger and despair. ' Kim Ji-young, a trauma program manager at Aju University Hospital, who helps director Lee, said Monday, I have hardly slept since the first round of operations on the soldier. I never even entered the house. Director Lee said, "" The left retina blood vessel broke two years ago, and I am close to my real name. She has been on the table 14 times, but she can not recover. At a news conference on July 22, Lee launched a frontal assault on some political, public hospital officials, military doctors and some doctors. Lee spoke privately in recent years and revealed the issue. They criticize the center's director, saying, Disclosing information on patients such as parasite infections, fecal matter and embedded corn is a violation of medical laws and human rights. It was Jeong EuI-dang, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Party, who described Lee as a political figure. Kim yesterday made Lee`s vivid description of a parasite filled with guts and a serious violation of medical procedures by mentioning fecal matter in his small intestine and corn in his stomach, Kim said. A public health official also recently said on Facebook, We wonder whether North Korean soldiers have neither human rights nor privacy. Who agrees to release patient information? Some doctors criticized Professor Lee's former school, Aju University Medical School, as if to belittle it. Q : There is a debate on the human rights of North Korean soldiers.A : "" The operating and resuscitation rooms are covered in blood. If the medical team has a foot or leg injury, all kinds of germs, such as hepatitis or tuberculosis, can be passed on to the patient. - Are there any human rights of medical teams? The skin is operated when the feces, blood, and corn of a North Korean soldier are splattered. - Do you have North Korean soldiers ' human rights? Such criticism stops nurses. Try to avoid being a surgeon I feel so humiliated doing this in blood. "" Q : Did you decide to disclose the status of North Korean soldiers alone?A : It was revealed in consultation with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I talk to the JCS nearly every day. We should respect the privacy of North Korean soldiers, but I think it is equally important that the people have the right to know. "" Q : I think it is important that we have patient consent.A : All the photos of patients used by the conference for research were agreed upon (Professor Lee showed a scrapbook of consent). North Korean soldiers could not even obtain consent. I will receive it when I recover. "" Q : Please explain more about the human rights of the medical team.A : "" Every time I ride in a helicopter, I get scratched on my legs. Then, the surgery is performed. One time, she operated on an AIDS patient without prior information. A nurse miscarried during a helicopter evacuation. I was also discouraged, Lee said in a briefing, refuting criticism from the medical community by saying, "" We are now showing Lee's Korean race over nothing. "" As a representative example, a local hospital director (who runs a local trauma center) disclosed a document he passed to the National Assembly during a parliamentary audit last year. The director of the hospital said in a paper, The budget was passed because Professor Lee Kook-jong carried out a wonderful show to operate on Captain Seok Hae-kyun, who is not a serious trauma patient. Professor Lee saved Seok, who was severely injured when he rescued a hostage kidnapped by Somali pirates in 2011. The director of the center said, The hospital chief scored eight points for captain Seok, but in reality, he scored 18 points (15 points or more is a serious injury). At the briefing, the captain revealed images of pus and a rupture in the shooting part of the captain. Lee called the captain on the night of July 21 to ask for permission to show the photos. Lee said, The captain has struggled a month and a half, compared with the North Korean soldier who is an easy patient. Still, it`s hard to live with the show. The audit document released on July 22 by Lee revealed the names of influential politicians who say that heads of local hospitals are like family. There are many critical articles on doctors ' websites. One doctor criticized Lee, saying, I feel like I am hooked on playing doctor. Some doctors are cynical about "" comedy. "" Professor Lee's health is worst. When he hurt his left eye, he says, "" I hope my right eye gets worse. That's why I wanted to quit the trauma center. Blood pressure has been raised to 240 to 180 mmh. High blood pressure and extreme stress damaged my eyes. I take three blood pressure pills, but I can't control them. When my left eye got worse, I could not use chopsticks well for 3 months. The operation was also difficult. They only work with their eyes focused. It is said to have slowed down slightly. In 2012, he hurt his left knee while taking a patient out of a helicopter. I take stomach medicine because of irregular meals and stress. She has also collapsed several times.

Prosecutors have spoken out in an angry tone, criticizing the court and finding ways to deal with the issue in the future. Prosecutors and the court said Monday that the reason why the criminal court's criminal division of the Seoul Central District Court, which judges Shin Gwang-ryul, had requested Thursday, failed to confirm the release of the suspect and explained that it was not possible to do so. Prosecutors will ask former cyber commanders Yeon Jae-wook and others to raise their voices on whether they supported the ruling camp and criticized the opposition, and whether or not they should appoint 79 former high-ranking government officials as "" agents of the Workers ' Party "" to comment on the appointment. Prosecutors arrested Kim on July 11 by issuing arrest warrants at the court, and former minister Kim requested that the arrest be justified. The review was one of the issues concerning whether Kim`s V sign read in a daily report by cyber companies on the manipulation of comments was any indication of his acceptance or indication of misconduct. The court judged that the circumstances alone do not justify Kim's explanation.

In particular, the prosecution is advised by former Defense Minister Lim Kwan-bin, who was arrested on the same charge, and former chief of psychological operations, who was ordered by former Defense Minister Kim to carry out cyber operations, to the highest possible extent. Stressing the court's repeated rejection of the request to issue a warrant for the arrest of key suspects during the recent investigation, prosecutors said, "" If the evidence is not solid enough, it is unlikely that the current court will issue an arrest warrant against Kim when it is subject to change. Lee Myung-bak, the former president some setbacks are inevitable in an investigation into the political analysts. Prosecutors are expected to summon former minister Kim again soon after analyzing the court's judgment grounds. Kim Hyo-jin, reporter at hjn2529@asiae.co.kr"
"If a serious trauma patient visits an emergency medical center instead of a trauma center, he should receive medical treatment as a practice and get a new central trauma committee. (Yonhap news agency, Kim Kil-won, a reporter at Seoul National University Hospital) confirmed that he had defected from North Korea The incident has continued to draw public acclaim for the regional topology center, but the overall system needs to be improved as doctors say the center's role has not yet been established due to operational difficulties and manpower shortages. The Regional trauma center is staffed 24 hours a day with professional trauma teams consisting of trauma surgeons, neurosurgeurges and paramedics that can be dealt with within 10 minutes of the arrival of a critically ill patient. The goal is to provide integrated and essential care immediately, from resuscitation and initial care of patients to emergency procedures or surgeries. The establishment of a local trauma center was started in January 2011 to reduce deaths from damages after raising public interest in the case of captain Seok Hae-kyun. According to the medical community on July 23, the preventable rate stood at 35.2 percent if the treatment was properly treated during trauma in Korea. That is two to three times more than the 10 to 20 percent of the U.S., Germany and Japan.North Korean soldiers who defected to the South Korean Hospital (Suwon = Yonhap News Agency) are transferred by helicopter to the Ouijoo Hospital of Aju University in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, on July 13. The Ministry of Health has selected 16 regional trauma centers nationwide since 2012, and nine of them are currently in operation. When selected as the local trauma center, it receives 8 billion won for the purchase of equipment and facilities, and 700 to 2.7 billion won for the annual operation cost. According to the Trauma and Treasurer Management data, as of June this year, the Regional trauma center had 226 physicians (9-23 per appliance), 39 trauma coordinators, and 829 nurses. Last year, 18.9 percent of the patients who visited the local trauma center were seriously affected. However, many say that such a regional trauma center is not functioning yet. As the public and emergency medical workers are not well informed of the trauma center, the role of the local trauma center and emergency medical center is not clearly divided, the patient care system is not effective throughout the hospital stage. For example, patients with serious injuries who need systematic responses from trauma teams visit the emergency medical center first, even though they have to deal with trauma teams, so they can not receive quick diagnosis and appropriate first aid in an emergency room. Because of this, emergency procedures such as angiography, surgical treatment, and intensive intensive care in intensive care units are being delayed. Professor of trauma critical care at Busan National University Hospital's Regional trauma center said, "" If serious trauma patients first find an emergency medical center or emergency medical institution, the flow of primary care is so limited that it is not necessary to have a full diagnostic assessment that is necessary to survive within a limited time. "" Professor Cho stressed that when the patients with severe injuries are transferred to the local trauma center, they will be thrown into a state of imperishability after Golden Time.Professor Lee Guk-jong (Yonhap News Agency) on Tuesday afternoon, Kwon Joon-woo, a professor of South Korean soldiers ' home in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, and was shot by North Korean soldiers. As the severity of the injury is ranked low on stop@yna.co.kr and experts say that the more traumatic patients are, the disadvantage in the evaluation of senior hospitals needs to be improved. "" The local trauma centers were more vulnerable to the lack of funds provided by the government, "" said Professor Han Ho-sung of Seoul National University Hospital's surgery department at Bundang Hospital. Another problem is the lack of special credit staff, which is required to satisfy the local trauma center, and the lack of handling of such workers. At the same time, patient trauma, microstherapy, and coronary artery surgery, which are difficult to provide comprehensive medical collaboration during the course of the treatment from hospital to hospital, are still inadequate for immediate care and require highly specialized care. The ""To create a superior Korean trauma care system, the central Government, South Korea's Emergency Medical Center Trauma Association, areas is organically to work, such as trauma center."", and it's a professor.""The medical reality, the number and territories should be able to seek for financial independence of the trauma center."" said. Professor Han then went on to expand education and support for all trauma - related medical personnel (doctors, nurses, coordinators, fire fighting) ▲ Increase emergency surgery on the trauma center's emergency handling system until patients are able to focus on their trauma. bio@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ We are going to shoot Starbucks coffee for 400 minutes by [Weather] noon.

The first daughter, Malia, 19, had enough boyfriends to kiss him. The boyfriend's existence was revealed on July 18 when a photo of Malia kissing her at a football game at Harvard University and Yale University was unveiled. Malia and her brother, Laurie, graduated from the prestigious boarding school Rugby School in Wirikshire, England, and served as student representative during their time there. Rugby School's annual tuition is 32,000 pounds (approximately 46.43 million won). Laurie's father, Charles Paquason, is Chief Executive Officer of the London Investment Fund Management Group.

Obama, former president is already gained a reputation as a 'Crazy about daughter' save daughter using the same. He sang to the family in celebration of Independence Day last year, and during an ice cream vacation, his daughters celebrated on a birthday in Malaysia and spent a public holiday in Hawaii. Last August, I carried some stuff from Malia to Harvard dorm with sunglasses on, and at a fundraiser in September, I said, "" I felt as if I was having a heart operation. "" jaelee@newsis.com> As the "" World's Middle and Farm Life and Three-Term Business Administration "" was reported to have sold out its shares of promising small and medium businesses and the "" Getty Business Company "" was recently launched to provide the biggest profits. There is a growing calls for more longer-life businesses to step up their institutional support to support the nation`s economic fundamentals.According to the industry on July 22, the head of Uniders ' Chairman Kim Seong-hun signed a contract with one other person to sell 3 million shares (34.88 percent stake) of the company's shares to others. Kim was granted inheritance tax worth more than 5 billion won (3,044,400 shares) on the shares of the company that his founder's father, Kim Deok-seong, inherited when he passed away in 2015. Kim reportedly sold control of the company due to a lack of funds to pay inheritance taxes, although he once expressed his will to manage the company by filing taxes.There are many cases that a second generation entrepreneur, like Junidus, can not afford to pay inheritance tax and sold the company. Nongwoo Bio, a technology that was designed to become the No.1 seed in Korea but was switched by heavy inheritance tax. Founded in 1967, the company was involved in inheritance tax when founder Ko Hee-seon suddenly passed away in 2013. At that time, the sales of agricultural cow biosection products amounted to 676.6 billion won, and the number of employees was 403. However, the inheritance tax imposed on the bereaved families exceeded 100 billion won. The bereaved families had to sell the company and pay inheritance tax because they could not afford to pay it. The world`s No.1 handper-hander, Sam-dae, also received an inheritance tax of approximately 15 billion won from his family after founder Kim Hyung-kyu became famous in 2008. The bereaved sold their shares of the company instead of taking over the family business. In particular, the sale of the company was pushed ahead with the plan to pay inheritance tax, and the third party was sold for 18 billion won, less than the fair value of the company. As a result, a representative of a mid-sized business organization recently said, "" Extracting inheritance taxes when the transfer is not ready was to be carried out on a sudden basis was not just to blame for the sale of companies. The nation's excessive inheritance tax and strict regulations also encourage businesses to take shortcuts. As the inheritance tax, which is estimated to be worth 150 billion won, is being paid by OtteogI, the epitome of good businesses, and it has not been able to overcome this pressure. Ottoger's company, Ottogeramoon, raised 99 percent of its revenue last year (591.3 billion won) by trading with the company. When Otteurgiramyeon produces the product, the company offers the product as a way to buy and sell it outside of the company. The biggest shareholder of the unlisted company Ottogera-myeon is Chairman Ham (35 percent), who is increasing the wealth of the majority shareholder's family by illegally giving work to employees. Under the Fair Trade Act, companies subject to regulations on job sharing should pay more than 5 trillion won in assets before OtteogI does so illegally. However, many people who praised their thumbs as "" god plus ottergI "" are disappointed with OtteogI's work. Business circles see OtteogI's handling of business affairs, criticized as "" a good-looking company, "" as being highly related to raising inheritance tax. In March, Chairman Han deposited 375,000 of his shares in the Seoul Central District Court. This is the nature of providing mortgages for 150 billion won inheritance tax, which is set to be paid in installments over a five-year period until 2022 when it arrives at Gangnam District Tax Office. The 370,000 won mortgage shares account for 38 percent of the company`s shares in Ottogi, a stock that can affect the company`s dominance. Business officials said, If Chairman Han sells the shares as collateral because he failed to secure the funds, the total shares held by the company would fall below 20 percent, which would allow the chairman to take control of the company without any problems.Min Jae-yong, reporter at insight@hankookilbo.com[ⓒ Do not illegally transfer or redistribute by Hankook Ilbo (hankookilbo.com),]"
"Park Chul-hong, a reporter at the College Scholastic Ability Test (Gwang-ju = Yonhap News Agency), said, "" If there is an earthquake and fire, there will be an evacuation route on October 23 at Gwangju High School. pch80@yna.co.kr (Yonhap news agency), Ryu Seong-moo, Dae-seong, Choi Soo-ho, and the assistant professor of math ability test were held in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province on July 23. According to the Korea Meteorological Administration, the magnitude 1.7 quake hit at a spot 9 kilometers north of Pohang City, at 11:35 a.m. The small size caused no harm. However, reports of vibrations or heard a "" bang "" were sent to the Korea Meteorological Administration.In North Gyeongsang Province, the test was continued because the test results were so small that one can not feel any shaking. Another official at the university said, "" There is nothing wrong with the tests and we are taking them regularly at all centers. "" suho@yna.co.kr Kim, who was arrested on July 11, requested an investigation into whether or not he should be detained. The examination of the appropriateness of an arrest is a system in which a suspect asks the court to determine whether the arrest was lawful and necessary. It is very rare for a suspect to be released on an important case through the influence of his or her enemy.The court held an hour-long review to determine whether to detain Kim and the prosecution, and decided to release it around 9.30pm. The court has guaranteed the right to argue, "" The extent to which Kim gave illegally instructed and called for conspiracy, based on what he explained, it is difficult to say whether he committed a crime or not, and that his right to defend himself is certain to run away. "" Kim, who left Seoul around 10:40 p.m., said, I will sincerely face the investigation. The release of Kim despite sufficient calling for an accusation is not understandable, the prosecution said.Kim was accused of violating a criminal law that prohibited his involvement in politics by ordering the Cyber Command of the Korean Army to make political comments so that the ruling camp can win in the 2012 parliamentary and presidential elections. It is also accused of increasing its staff of 79 and ordering not to pick any of its members from Honam.The case of former Minister Kim was controversial when a warrant was first sought. Kim was called the "" most feared soldier in North Korea. "" He was appointed chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Roh Moo-hyun administration, Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye, the Secretary of Defense in government national security as chief of staff in moderation. the silver linings 'a through and through'.The minister's arrest is a big shock case. In addition, amid the increasing power of the cyber warfare between the two Koreas, the cyber headquarters of the South Korean armed forces has become involved in a criminal act, sparking controversy.Prosecutors returned Kim's daily report on cyber history by marking "" V "" on the cover of his report, which ' gave Kim's endorsement of the comments and a specific warrant for his arrest. ' Prosecutors said Kim was also actively involved in politics ahead of the 2012 general and presidential elections when the ruling camp lost in the 2011 by-election for Seoul mayor.Former Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin leaves Seoul Detention Center in Uiwang, Gyeonggi Province, on July 22. Kim was arrested on July 11 on charges of ordering a psychological warfare group at the headquarters of the South Korean armed forces in the general and presidential elections in 2012. The Seoul Central District Court, while its members were in charge of the crime, decided to release Kim, saying, There is room to argue whether the crime should be established or not. Regarding Yonhap news, Kim said the V mark was customary as ` We Saw `, and indicated that there were no cyber orders on political issues such as general elections, presidential elections, construction of a naval base in Jeju, and the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. The court's decision on the same day was considered to have been difficult to justify Kim's political involvement only with the V sign that he made the decision.The arrest of a suspect is when a criminal charge is alleged, runs away, or destroys evidence. Initially, a judge in charge of the arrest warrant issued a warrant for Kim, saying, We are now calling for political involvement as a major charge and fear of destroying evidence. However, the judge who is in charge of the court's decision issued by the court a completely different judgment and interpretation. There is not enough explanation for the crime, and there is no fear of running away or destroying evidence. "" In fact, they judged that there was no reason for the arrest. Some say that the arrest warrant was originally issued by the government was too mechanical.Kim also actively called for the possibility of escape and destruction of evidence during the screening process. Prosecutors told the former minister through an arrest warrant that since the court is expecting a heavy sentence in the upcoming trial, he could kill himself or run away due to pessimism about his safety. He also said, "" As Kim can exert influence on the Defense Ministry, he could destroy evidence. "" Kim said, We do not see any evidence to destroy since the prosecution has already secured all evidence to establish the truth about the relationship, and whether the defense minister and the head of the national security department should live a lifetime as a soldier and run away from it. The court also accepted Kim`s stance on the issue.Of 2,466 district court applications last year, 367 decided to quote : Quotes are only around 15 %. Most of the cases cited are not accepted because the circumstances of the examination of a warrant are different from the actual ones. Usually, the accused are quoted as having an enemy force when he confesses, and it is said that he would be released without any special circumstances, such as Kim. As usual, early morning, families and teachers who encouraged test-takers cheered them in front of the test centers. Although the support will be consistent, the words of encouragement for the CSAT have changed with the times. I collected words of encouragement from the university entrance exam. Students cheer for the examinees on November 17, 1999.

One popular word that dominated the 1999 period was "" Don't Ask, Get hurt, "" which actor Cha Tae-hyeon and Kim Jong-un said in their advertisements for the telecommunications series. The comment on the advertisement was as follows to emphasize that it can have two phone numbers. There are numbers that tell anyone and numbers that tell only one person.

"" The problem is that the woodwind is rather weak. It appears that one of the items is to be given up, experts said, advising us to speed up preservation. These tombs were located on a mountain to the north and on a bank of the Kumho River to the south. A number of wooden wooden tombs have been found near the Geumgang River, a tributary of the Nakdonggang River.Jeokseok Gunggum, from Hayang-eup, Seoul. psh59@yna.co.kr ▶ Report on articles and inquiries (click!) ▶ Cover for Starbucks coffee for 400 people who subscribed to Yonhap News Channel. "" Kim Hyeon-tae, deputy chief of the Seoul Regional Public Prosecutors ' Office, first investigation into covering up the remains of the Sewol Seho, and an apology for discovering the remains of the deceased, will not be announced until after May 2004. "" Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Kim Young-choon announced the results of the first fact-finding efforts on the skeletons of Sewol Lake, which was buried by reporters at the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries on July 23. The Maritime Ministry conducted a survey of five team members at the scene of the Sewol`s issue, including Vice President Kim Hyun-tae, and found out that most of the news was true. Kim Hyun-tae, former site manager, was found to have received the remains of the accident in March, but gave confidential instructions after discussing them with Lee Chul-jo. Kim, the chief of the team, judged that it was the day before the funeral of the attempted prisoner, and that the skeleton was one of the first patients to be collected. After the funeral, he decided that it would be better to notify the families of the would-be refugees. According to the project manager's discretion, the skeleton of the Sewol accident was concealed. Regarding this, Minister of Construction Kim Young-choon said, "" Since it was the day before the funeral on the 17th, it is possible that the owners of the funeral service had caused one of the same problems during their previous days. "" I sincerely apologize to the bereaved family members of the Young-ja family and the bereaved families of the authorities who attempted to step down as head of the appropriate ministry that oversees the June issue, Kim said yesterday. At 11:30 a.m. on July 17, one of the bones was found to have been washed away from the hull room. Found while cleaning up the collected mud. After finding a bone believed to be the remains of a human being after the first on-site inspection, the crime scene center announced it to the hull committee five days later, and requested international inspectors for DNA testing on July 22. The problem was not revealed to the family of the would-be refugees or the hull investigation team even though they were informed of the results of an on-site examination that the site investigation headquarters was presumed to have been the remains of a human being. In addition, the press release that informs the situation of the search every morning and afternoon, did not have the same information. Without knowing this, the family held a joint memorial service on July 18. As a result, suspicion of covering up the government's intention was raised that it was the day before it withdrew. Meanwhile, among the nine outstanding swimmers who attempted to lift the Sewol in April, only four were found dead - Ko Chang-seok, Lee Young-sook, Heo Da-yoon and Jo Eun-hwa. The remaining five students are single plaintiffs, Nam Hyun-chul, Park Young-in, Yang Seung-jin, Kwon Jae-keun and her son Kwon Hyuk-kyu. sky0322@newsis.com>"
"# 1 Code for Demonstrating Discriminations of Network Investment (Network Investment Declinations) Decision by the Federal Communications Commission (Barack Obama) ; established by the FCC as a signal of changes in platform-neutrality policies (U.S.), including Google - Facebook) ; The principle of network neutrality is that ISPs should treat network users equally, not discriminate, so that ISPs use or do not discriminate against the amount of access or content of ▦ data, or use speed at which they are prohibited. This is the principle that the Internet network is considered a public good, driving the growth of platform operators such as Google and Facebook to global enterprises. As the FCC is an organization that presents global standards in the field of information and communication technologies (ICT), a major impact on the global Internet industry is expected when decommissioning is confirmed. AP predicted that the decision would not only send large companies such as Google and Facebook but also startup companies to the forefront.In a statement on July 21 (local time), FCC Chairman Ajit Phi stated, "" The federal government should stop excessive control and control of the Internet. "" The details of the measure will be unveiled on July 22. The FCC will propose to eliminate the principle of networthiness during the full meeting on the 14th of next month, and it expects to pass easily because of the large number of Republicans (three) among the five FCC members. In February 2015, when the Obama administration strongly supported the principle of network neutrality, the FCC passed a network-neutrality regulation, but Donald Trump administration said it would shrink ISPs ' investment in the Internet.Local governments prepared guidelines for network neutrality in 2011 and set reasonable traffic management standards for networks in 2013. Since July this year, a revised plan has also been implemented for the announcement of network neutrality. The policy has been maintained to strengthen network neutrality by legislating guidelines that are not legally binding.The U.S. decision has forced changes in domestic Internet policies. The local Internet industry immediately reacted negatively. We regret the United States ` decision, said Cha Jae-pil, policy director at the Korea Internet Business Association, which has more than 170 companies including Naver and Kakao Corp., as the crisis over any innovations we have built so far. They claim that the network-neutrality principle prevented the strong control of communication companies from reaching contents providers, allowing companies like Naver and Kakao to grow. Cha said, "" Telcos are likely to pay monthly rates from consumers, but they are more likely to switch to a use-based pricing scheme as in the past, and access to supplementary service providers is restricted. ""Telcos say they need to ease the network's neutrality. As the 5th generation (5G) era is set to see a rapid spread of the Internet of things, virtual and augmented reality, and ultra-definition content, it is a principle of network neutrality to handle explosive traffic and large-scale investment. The government is watching what will be on the final U.S. decision. The United States was the first country to adopt the concept of network neutrality. And the change in policy means shifting the information industry's priority from Internet companies such as Google and Facebook to networked network operators. Song Jae-seong, director of competition at the Science and Technology Ministry, said, We believe the network-neutrality principle initiated by the United States would provide Google and others with substantial benefits to help ease their networks into big businesses overseas.Lee Wang-koo, reporter of the Korea National University of Science and Technology, fab4@hankookilbo.comFormer Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin is leaving Seoul for a detention center in the afternoon of July 22. Kim was released on the day of questioning for the prosecution's arrest at the Seoul Central District Court. 【 = Newsis, Seoul, Korea ""There concerns about destroying evidence of the current strong influence doesn't ..."" as if he had to be somewhat delayed, indicted and arrested at the end of this month to mangusta@newsis.com first place ... time, 2017.11.22 and Auger dayNaunchae (of men hospitalized or in confinement) Journalist : Lee Myung-bak government forces, cyber command of involvement in the comments released and was arrested on charges of physical restraint in the investigation is former Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin.It seems to be. The investigation team has decided that it is difficult to request for an arrest warrant again. An official of the NIS investigation team of the Seoul Central District Public Prosecutors ` Office told reporters on July 23, We have not considered seeking an arrest warrant again. It is difficult to seek legal advice unless it is true of other crimes, said a spokesman for the private sector. Kim was previously charged with cyber political maneuvering by ordering former Defense Minister Youn-Chun to support the government, the ruling camp and the opposition parties from 2010 to 2014. However, Kim sought the judgment of the court, saying, "" The investigation into the arrest was unfair, "" and the court accepted the decision and ordered Kim to be released the day before. The Seoul Central District Court's criminal agreement, which quoted a request for Kim's involvement, said, "" We believe there is a reason why Kim is being questioned on whether he violated the law or not, "" adding, "" It is difficult to determine whether he was involved in a conspiracy. "" Regarding this, the prosecution announced its official position the day before, and on the same day again it expressed concern and discontent. Considering that former Minister Kim contacted important witnesses during the prosecution investigation, and considering the influence of former Defense Minister personnel, it is highly probable that evidence will be destroyed. A prosecution official said, If someone has served as such a common sense, their influence would be strong even if they were not present, and that future investigations on their partners would not be lost. The time of the indictment is likely to be slightly later than planned. Kim was scheduled to be put on trial by the end of this month, considering the deadline for arrest. However, since the court says the former minister Kim's allegation is contentious, it is necessary to secure additional evidence to prove the allegation. Prosecutors plan to summon former minister Kim for questioning in the process. kafka@newsis.com>"
"[CBS News Show for Kim Hyun-jung] - First SNS article, National Intelligence Service (98:00) and Unwanted Press Conference (Force) - Conducted by Kim Hyun-jung, North Korean Refugee's Disligeration with tweezers - Jung's Disligation of North Korean People : Professor Lee Guk-jong said, It is hard to understand why I have disclosed the parasite state of North Korean soldiers, saying, "" It is a murder of a character. "" And I said, "" I feel so humiliated when I say why this is personality murder. "" And I literally vented my anger. It has been a big talk all day yesterday. It was Jeong Ui-dang and Kim Jong-dae who criticized Professor Lee Guk-jong. Kim even said, "" I have never seen such a patient before, "" showing that North Korean soldiers are tree frogs in the laboratory. Professor Lee also made such criticism for violating medical laws. I think it would be best to listen to Congressman Kim Jong-dae directly. Let's connect with Kim Jong-dae, a member of the National Assembly. I am Jeong-euI-dang and Kim Jong-dae. Are you with me, Mr. Kim? Hello Kim Jong Dae ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I interview often, but I have never seen him come to the conversation. It is the first time for me, too. I never expected it, and I first raised the issue six days ago, and I haven't had a chance to do anything since then. And when we first raised the issue, we did not mention Professor Lee Guk-jong, but rather the government's unwarranted involvement in the patient care situation, and the media coverage, the interview of Aju University Hospital. Professor Lee Guk-jong, however, never used the phrase of murder in character, nor did he use the word murder in itself. And our society is not interested in protecting the refugees but rather in judging and ideologically managing them as we please. No one had any objection when they pointed it out like this. But three days later, one media reported that I was the first to attack Professor Lee Guk-jong, and told Professor Lee Guk-jong to get a response from him. Things started to develop rapidly in the direction of the argument between me and Professor Lee Gook-jong. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : Since the confrontation broke out, the problem has become. When they first posted an article on social networking sites, they did not appoint Professor Lee Guk-jong, but they were reflected in the event. How many days were all right then? No counterargument? The sympathetic response was more prevalent than the Kim Jong Dae > ◇ Was Kim Hyeon-jung more dominant? Where is the media, then? This is Kim Jong Dae > Channel A. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > drove the team into confrontation. The problem started as if they were attacking? If you read the first article, how did most people attack Professor Lee Jong-dae? It is more like a statement of defense. Professor Lee Guk-jong complained about it. I'm a doctor who saves people. Why force a news conference to be reluctantly pushed to hold under the pressure of any request or public opinion by the state agencies, citing the phrase. There was an argument that was made in this way. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Okay. I understand the intentions of Congressman Kim Jong-dae. What is the purpose of your article? However, when I listen to the story, I can not but think of anyone who briefed on it as Professor Lee Kuk-jong who eventually wrote about the story of Yi Guk-jong and the parasite and told about Lee Guk-jong. If you look closely at the fact that it is Kim Jong Dae >, one of the two national university students is a different person, but I think there are distortions about the nature of the incident and its background. Professor Lee Guk-jong's statement was made public at a meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And I can't do this kind of press conference anymore. It is also quite burdensome to look outside at the first press conference. I've told this story countless times. Professor Lee Guk-jong was forced to hold a press conference without any intention of his intention. That is why Professor Lee's intention is not to, but it is the result that the entire society has driven it. Then there is more trouble with the attitude of the press. These points are not attacks on Professor Lee, but the reflection of our society, which drove him to this point, is crucial. I think the story is fully reflected in my writing first. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Then, let me ask you two questions. One, the parasite and the fecal matter of a North Korean soldier, the part that revealed the corn in the stomach. On this point, is still personality terrorism, do you think there is a problem? Whether it is a national professor or not about the fact that it has been disclosed. There is a problem with the disclosure. ◇ There is a problem with Kim Hyun-jung? Member for Kim Jong-dae (Facebook) and his wife (Facebook) captured by you -- why didn't you get traumatic? It's a defect or disease in the body of a former patient, independent of any major injury that could lead to a serious life condition. Then, such defects or illnesses are not fatal. However, when the surgeon gave a briefing during the surgery, he experienced good cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and there was no additional infection except surgery. We're going to give you a full briefing on the health of these patients. But since it has since appeared, Professor Lee briefed me yesterday on whether I was able to go a little overboard. Because it was a necessary part of medicine, it revealed parasites and fecal matter. In surgery, the enteroanastomosis, the suture. I briefed you on one of the crucial effects of the result, which is the fecal matter with the parasite. He said, "" I don't know what to do. I respect the professionalism of the doctor. And that could be an important parameter in medical judgment. But now the question is, how did you successfully treat the trauma? And couldn't such cases of previous physical condition or illness be enough to go through quite a bit of surgery? But what's actually been reported in the media is that it's more than that : 60 centimeters of parasites, thousands of eggs and parasites, and that's why they pick it up with tweezers. ◇ Do you think you overstepped the limits of Kim Hyun-jung? No such vivid description was made at the original press conference. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > So did the announcement made by Lee Guk-jong, but the media, which exaggerated it and reported it as a more positive one, was more problematic. You're referring to this part. You mean that? Kim Jong Dae was described as if it were being seen vividly. And what worries me most about this process is the presence of more than 20,000 North Korean refugees in our society, which can create disgust among them. I'm starting to get a little concerned, and they called me on the telephone a lot, and they're the only ones I'm encouraged by. ◇ Do you get encouragement from the people of North Korea? Kim Jong Dae, I think they were nervous when the news first broke, but first of all, I blocked the additional report by filing a complaint, so they are grateful. Many people have expressed this position. Do you feel this bias when you see North Korean citizens running around as if they have parasites? Whenever news like Kim Jong-dae or the like comes out, they actually react most sensitively, and some are even reluctant to eat with the defectors in the future. Did you hear that, Kim Hyun-jung? I heard that Kim Jong Dae > ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Okay. But isn't it news that people are curious about? Very special, not just for the average patient, I mean, does a soldier from North Korea save his life now? In such a dire situation, such as survival, the president might have briefed the public in more detail than at any other time. The other is asking questions about when and how. Even though you raised the question at this time, I mean Professor Lee Kook-jong. Did medical teams really have to address the issue at a time when they should focus on saving patients? What do you think of these two? Jeong EuI-dang (left), lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Party Kim Jong-dae, and Kim Jong-dae, director of the National Intelligence Service's office's office of serious trauma center (photo), did not concentrate their influence on treating patients. And what I'm asking is, don't do that. How can this be a distraction to health care? I didn't say it again, but the media stirred him by telling me that. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > the media stimulated him. When we put the words together, it is said that Professor Lee and Professor Lee have a bigger misunderstanding. I think there is a misunderstanding on the part of Kim Jong Dae > ◇ Have you tried calling Kim Hyun-jung? So, I can assure you that you will visit me when things calm down a little yesterday's press conference. If you can answer that openly, I will hurt you. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung, why didn't you call me? First of all, he says he's too tired to concentrate on his treatment, so give him a call and get it off the hook. I will call Kim Jong Dae > I didn't think I could have done anything"
"Since you were in the middle of a press conference like this, it's not appropriate to call at that time. I was speaking to someone in the middle of something that I was going to sound out a call or visit with sooner or later. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Okay. Now that you've mentioned that you're mistaken, there are quite a few listeners who are asking you to apologize, don't you think so? First of all, there is some responsibility and some regret of us for the disclosure of any such excessive information, and I too would have made such a part of my apology a little bit too public. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Okay. Yesterday, today. So many people are arguing with each other over this issue. Today, I heard what National Assemblywoman Kim Jong Dae said. Thank you very much, Senator Kim, for saying that. Thank you for your kindness. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Jung EuI-dang Kim Jong Dae.

After paying a show of hands to the exam room, they bowed deeply before disbanding. `` Getting rid of the trash and extending the back support, '' said Kim Seong-hyuk, 17, a middle school senior official. `` I'm afraid it would give me bad energy if the exam was dirty.

Kim has no religion, but he plans to pray at the church or the church on this day when he meets with parents of other test-takers. Parents of high school students also held their expectation positions next to the front door. I can`t leave school, said one of the parents who took the test. I'm afraid something could come up in the middle of it. I think listening to the bell at the beginning of the test will make me feel better.Cho Ji-ye (47), a parent of a middle and high school student, also said, I have been feeding my child the same side dish for lunch for days, afraid that he might get sick on test day. I hope the test ends well without any problems. The younger brother, who visited the exam together, said, It is more disturbing to think I should have the same problem three years later.A test taker is lost in thought at Ewha Girls ' Foreign Language High School in Seoul on the morning of July 23, when the 2018 College Scholastic Ability Test was held.▽ Photo = Some of the reporter Lee Ki-beom entered the examination room just in time.

Kim Yong-jin, a female high school teacher at Dongguk University, said in a briefing on the Korean language section, It was slightly more difficult to assess the scores made up of students who took the test in September, and gave us two to three questions about the difficulty levels found in reading. Cho Young-hye, a Seoul Science High School teacher, also said, There were some sensitive questions and high scores of students who felt they felt were not connected to EBS and that they were not included in the textbooks. Many say the Korean language section was relatively difficult due to the abolition of the standardized tests and changes in the types of problems during the 2017 CSAT. In two mock tests this year, the evaluation results showed mixed reactions compared to last year. Mopyeong was slightly more difficult than the CSAT last year, and was easy in September, according to a recent report. Lee Joon-sik, head of the CSAT test committee at Sungkyunkwan University, told a briefing on the day, "" We will normalize the education by focusing on the content of the course and basic contents based on the overall test trends. "" As for the Korean language section, we have used fingerprints and materials of various subjects based on the scope of the examination. The ratio of test questions to EBS textbooks was 71.1 %. Korean words were set as math family type, 70.0 %, and English language, 70.1 %, and Korean history and social studies, research, and vocational studies.

Kwon also called in NIS officials who had no authority to investigate the case, saying the team was the strangest and most dissatisfied thing in referring to Kim`s repeated phone calls.Police had earlier on December 16, 2012 NIS 11 p.m. on Kim's main opposition Democratic United Party candidates during the Moon Jae-in intermediate investigation results for the alleged comments, Kim's.Presidential elections, Moon Jae-in, Park Geun-hye in personal computer that contains the relevant keywords have stirred up controversy found that there is no sign to comment. Police Chief Lee Kwang-seok said, We asked the Cyber Crime Unit of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency to analyze our Internet access records and documents and failed to grasp the contents of the allegation.However, the prosecution's recent investigation, which began at the request of the National Intelligence Service's General Assembly to dispose of the evil, revealed the NIS ` organized comment, prompting a series of comments from police.Prosecutors have captured the circumstances of the NIS ` involvement in police investigations at the time. Prosecutors have caught the revelation that an NIS official who was in charge of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency made about 45 contacts with Kim at the time, and suspects he was a connection between the NIS and the police. Prosecutors also note that 11 minutes after the police revealed the results of their surprise interim investigation, there was a disclosure of the NIS ' press release that was critical of the Democratic Party.After being searched and searched for his office that day, Kim reportedly told a subordinate that he had a lot to say with resentment."
"Kids are playing in the play area in one place of the refugee evacuation center. Pohang City built play spaces on July 22 for the children left alone, such as parents going to work. "" Mom, I'll meet you when the quake hits me again at junior high school, "" Park (9) told his mother at the gym in Heunghae-eup, North Gyeongsang Province yesterday morning. Heunghaejung is an outdoor shelter. She said, "" Okay, I'll see you there. My son closed the tent door. Children were left in about 10 tents at the gym. Other shelters are also similar. Though the victim was left homeless, her parents had to leave for work again. Children from seven temporarily closed elementary schools remain in shelters. Be in a two-man tent alone They are also nervous about minor aftershocks. When 2.5 aftershocks hit at 12:41 p.m., one child wore a blanket. Children solve hunger with cup noodles and snacks. Volunteers provide hot rice soup at every meal, but it is hard to imagine eating it with strangers in a separate room. One mother was concerned, saying, I don`t want my child to open the lunch line, so I eat ramen. They also receive new aid or take official documents such as the application for relocation. Children were seen on a relief line on July 19, the first day when about 1,000 people from the victims moved to the elementary schools of Hongae and Namsan. The children watched the officers and adults argue over whether or not they received the aid. `` When I receive the aid, I find myself a victim. It is upsetting to see an adult say he or she is in an evacuation center to get more money. Government officials must check their name tags at the entrance to the shelter before they can be sent to the shelter. It is to protect the privacy of the sufferers. But the frustrated children often wore their IDs on their way back into the shelters, when they got into a little scuffle. It was heartbreaking to see the boy who left his name tags in the tent shrink next to the gate of the shelter, Chang (45, female) said. Until that day, 16 children visited the psychological support center in three of the nine evacuation centers in Buk-gu. She often came here without her parents. I saw an officer get angry at Mom for giving me a blanket of aid. I feel sorry because I feel like I am treating my family like a beggar, one child said. Some of the children were stressed out when adults fought with their voices up around them, and then went to the bathroom in the blankets. Kim (12) said, I don't know when to pack up and move out of the shelter, so I overheard government officials talking about it and I do Kakak to my mom. As the earthquake hits its eighth day, the surrounding areas are getting tired of it. Another mother said, I received a text message urging me to pay my tuition at my hagwon. I asked my hagwon teacher, ' Please don't tell such a story to your kid '.Pohang = journalist Kim Dan-bi kubee08@donga.com Kim Yena, a reporter of the Korea Coast Guard and Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Agency (Yonhap news agency) on November 23, 1717.23 : The victims ' families of the accident were responsible for covering up the remains of the accident after discovering the remains of the person who attempted to be buried in the sea in the sea in March.

On June 22, in a (北京) in Beijing, China, Kang Kyung-hwa, a former foreign minister and king in the meeting between the (王毅) Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Moon Jae-in will push ahead the middle of next month, state visit of the president agreed.It is also assessed to be railroads is highly significant in the improvement of relations between the two flow. Although this year marks the 25th anniversary of diplomatic ties between Korea and China, the sard conflict was so intense that neither the summit was held in August, nor the foreign minister visited each other. At the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations is the president is the door before the highest is looking for a state visit to China next month in the form of symbolic is expected to have significant meaning in China. National Diplomat Professor Kim Han-kwon said on July 23, "" As the two countries approach the framework of improving relations, I believe that the best approach is to stress the importance of the bilateral relations through the talks on state visits. "" Sade to suture the issue last November after the announcement of the March 31 'result of discussions regarding relations between Korea and China', the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (apec) summit as a turning point.Kang Kyung-hwa, a minister, side by side, 21 to 23 summit between Korea and China heoiting and his first visit of the (何毅亭) of the Communist Party of China visit, managing vice president (ministerial) jungangdanggyo.On top of the momentum of China restore flows, the president's door in a state visit is expected to be among the highlights. In addition, the two foreign ministers agree on the peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue and the need for stable management of the situation on the Korean Peninsula, and the two countries will work together to establish a peaceful hosting stage for the development of the Korean Peninsula from February to March next. There is also an expectation that Korea and China, two countries that have exchanged the THAAD conflict, could work together to bridge the gap between the two countries. However, it appears that the future of the two countries ' relationship is not without double track. Most of all, China is concerned that the Korean government's remarks on the $ 3-plus (additional THAAD deployment - U.S. missile defense system (MD) participation - U.S., Japan and Japan, in the context of the THAAD suture agreement, are actually public pledges. During the ministerial meeting, Wang said, Korea did not join the U.S. missile defense system and expressed a view that the THAAD, the temporary deployment of missiles to Korea, would not harm China`s security and interests, China said. It is forecast that Beijing would try to get involved in Korea`s security and sovereignty issue if Beijing keeps mentioning what Seoul said was a `` never pledged '' $ 3, even given Beijing's domestic political demands. Diplomats say such a move could lead to controversy over the appropriateness of the THAAD suture agreement. The fact that Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Yi and Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang continued to mention the step-wise handling of the THAAD system on July 22 also reaffirmed that China did not formally fold its goal to withdraw the THAAD missiles. As for China's handling of the stage, a government official said, "" Is it the end of the chapter? "" But Beijing may also complain about Seoul's decision to return to its $ 3 per month policy. Professor Kim Han-kwon said, It is hard for top leaders of the two countries to make concessions or change in the near term, adding, "" It is unlikely that China will make concessions in the near term, and that China will be able to incorporate the THAAD missiles or the U.S. or the South Korea, "" I think the ways in which Korea and China can improve their relationship while making a difference are actually most helpful, Kim stressed. jhcho@yna.co.kr • Report and inquiry (click!) ▶ Starbucks Coffee is issued for 400 minutes of subscription to Yonhap news channel Suseo High Speed Railway (SRT), Suseo High Speed Rail, Buddler, Construction, and Design Office The court deplored, saying, Is this how all of our civil engineering works are?The Seoul High Court Criminal Department 13 (senior judge Jeong Hyeong-sik) sentenced Doosan Construction site superintendent Hahm (56) to four hundred thousand won in jail for allegedly committing fraud on July 23.

As Zimbabwe's biggest investor and fourth-largest trade partner, China is expected to further deepen bilateral ties in the future, the daily said. In particular, a Emerson, which will be inaugurated as president (75) and eumnangageu the 1960s, before the Revolutionary War was former Vice President received military training in China and China.In an organization that runs the Communist Party ideology education is also a history. During his visit to China in 2015, he proposed to make the yuan a Zimbabwe legal currency. The Institute of Social Sciences and Social Sciences at West Asia and Africa said, "" He was also actively involved in the activities of local Chinese community. "" Currently, more than 10,000 Chinese are running mostly restaurants and manufacturers in Zimbabwe and are concentrated on investing in energy. China Electric Power China, a state-owned company, also launched projects to build an additional Zimbabwe power plant in 2015 worth 1.2 billion dollars. Wang Shuayi, an African expert at the China Institute of Social Sciences, also said, "" Though he had a similar political background to Mugabe's, he was less hard-line in terms of economic policies, such as the Kwang-Kagwa War on Independence and the establishment of government. "" Mbangag opposed a move two years ago to sell shares of local venture firms owned by foreign companies to their own companies. Two years ago, the official Chinese television network, also interviewed, Zimbabwe, said it is pushing for major economic reforms while creating an investment environment to attract capital. Western governments are imposing sanctions on the Mugabe administration for election fraud and human rights violations, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has frozen providing financial aid since Zimbabwe's default declaration in 1999. This helped the Mugabe administration get closer to China. China provided arms and funding to the guerrilla unit that Mugabe had allegedly led during the 1970 Zimbabwe independence war. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kaang told a weekly news briefing the day, "" Mugabe is a historic contributor to Zimbabwe's national independence and liberation movements, and Mr. Mugabe's decision is still good for China's friendship over the long haul.

"Math. The hardest math test last year, the same as last year's most difficult, 3~4 questions were higher than those of the KSAT ; absolute English assessment variables ; and "" Water and non-functioning assessment "" was announced by the CSAT faculty ; and the College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) was announced in 2018 From left, Sohn Tae-jin, Cho Man-ki, Chang Myung-gok, and Kim Chang-mook, students at Kyung-sik and Lee Tae-yoon of this year's College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) were judged slightly more difficult or similar to take last year's CSAT. Last year, math had the most difficult part of the CSAT in five years, with the highest rate of perfect score holders at 0.07 percent for brothers and 0.15 percent for brothers. The teachers ` group, who analyzed the math tests, said, We had a similar sentence compared to last year`s CSAT and Na was able to differentiate ourselves slightly from others last year. Teachers and admissions experts say the math of the second period was difficult after the first period of Korean language test. As the discrimination of top students weakens as English is adopted as an absolute assessment, difficult questions will play a role in entering the Korean language and mathematics world. The math test lasted 100 minutes from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. After lunch, examinees take an English test for 70 minutes, from 1:10 p.m. to 2:20 p.m. As for Na, difficult questions 4 were set, said Cho Man-kee, a teacher at Panggok High School. In particular, there were inference problems that were difficult to solve unless we correctly understood the concepts in the big framework. The new type of problem, "" Type 21, "" was judged to have to deduce the domain of justice by properly understanding the concept of "" synthesis of function, "" while the other 29, based on a given graph, was also an inference problem that identified the differential coefficients. In addition, 20 or 30 other questions were also pointed out as difficult. In addition, the sentence was higher on sentences No. 21, 29 and 30, said Sohn Tae-jin, a teacher at Pungmun High School. Number 21 was the problem that could be solved by utilizing the differentiation of log functions and the differentiation of inverse functions, and number 29 was the problem of finding the relationship between plane and sphere in coordinate space. Regarding the 30 questions that pose a difficult challenge on the CSAT each year, I think the 30 times can be different depending on the students compared to last year. Mathematics is also distinctive, according to Kim Chang-mook, a teacher at Kyungshin High School. However, it is hard to tell the overall level of difficulty so far this year because English is the absolute assessment. All of the questions are not difficult. The recent CSAT will eventually raise the score from one to three depending on how many of the remaining four questions are solved, although 26 of the 30 questions will be solved by the university's students. The phrase is not all difficult but rather the expression of the difficulty of the four questions, Cho added. Private education companies said, "" It is usually difficult to do so as last year. "" Lee Young-duk, director of Daeseong Education Research Institute, said, "" Compared to last year's CSAT, my penalty was similar and my penalty was larger. "" "" The hard questions were more similar to the mock tests made in September. "" On the other hand, Sky Education at Jongno University said Na was slightly easier than the CSAT last year. Sky Education Representative Lim Sung-ho of the Jongno Institute said, "" It was easier than the mock assessment in September, which was very difficult, and it was just a little bit easier or similar than last year`s CSAT, "" adding, `` But I could feel difficult depending on the students ' questions 20, 21 and 30. Teachers say the math monographics had 12 questions in Calculus II, 9 in Probability and Statistics, and 9 in geometry and vector. Type B showed 11 questions in Math 2, 11 in Calculus 1, and 8 in Probability and Statistics. The following is the question and answer of the councillor counselor and reporters on mathematics : "" What is the new type of problem and what is the difficult problem? ""A : All the high-degree questions were set in the new style this year. Mathematics brother is 20, 21, and 30. Na type is Shin Yoo Hyung. How to solve this problem distinguishes the top spot. Q : Have you seen a rise in my degree since last year?A : I didn't think all the questions were difficult. Among the 30 questions, the recent CSAT will be administered so that students in the third grade can solve 26 questions without difficulty. The first or third grade is divided depending on whether the remaining four questions are resolved. The four questions, which differentiate between one and three grades, may be more difficult than last year, but can not be considered inferior. If students within the junior level have to solve the problem 30 minutes per 100 minutes, they have 26 questions for 60 minutes. The first or third grade is divided depending on whether or not the remaining four problems are solved. Q : How difficult are the students?A : It's hard to predict how difficult it is to feel this time. The questions were more difficult than they were last year, but some students can feel them easily. It is how students will solve their gate-testing problem, which they spend a lot of time on. This year, although it may have taken less time to think about it, it may have been difficult to grasp the concept and make inferences. Q : What do you mean it was easy to solve a problem by doing an inference? A : In math or math, last year, if the question of asking for a general term of a function was put on the table, it was possible to solve a difficult problem by understanding the concept. If you could correctly interpret the conditions given to the problem and deduce whether the graph will look like this, the problem would have been solved, but it would have been difficult to figure out how the function would have been matched. Former prosecutor Kim Soo-nam and former justice minister Kim Hyun-woong were also among the subjects of the indictment. A senior official of the Korea Party said yesterday, We believe the prosecution has actually paid out a portion of the special expenses to the Justice Ministry each year. It is a clear criminal act, the prosecution said. The Korea Party accepted the bill via National Assembly's National Legislation and Judiciary Committee Rep. Joo Kwang-duk at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ` Office. We sent the letter of indictment in the morning of July 23, a Korea Party official said. Prosecutor General Moon Moo-il. [Yonhap news agency] said in a letter of indictment, If the Attorney General was given the authority to inappropriately use the special expenses assigned by the Attorney General to investigate prosecutors and collect information, Lee and his aide would have used the authority of the Attorney General as an appropriate authority.The charges in the indictment are violations of Article 2 (Additional Punishment on Bribery) and Article 5 (Loss of National Treasury) of the Additional Punishment Law on Specific Crimes, etc. This means that the head of the prosecution paid bribes to the government and the justice minister received them. This year, the Ministry of Justice Special Programs that are assigned to budget for 28.5 billion won budget information in intelligence budget and president called relatives to the special budget, the Parliamentary Commissioner for a license, and so on.Includes 93 billion won. Among the remaining 192 billion won in special expenses, the Justice Ministry is not allocated 1.3 billion won to prosecutors ' office, and some 17.7 billion won (or 17.2 billion won) is to be allocated to prosecutors ' money. Justice Minister Bahk Sang-kee, [Yonhap news agency] said, "" If the ministry assigns special activity fees to the ministry, the ministry will send some of them to the Supreme Public Prosecutors ' Office. "" The Justice Ministry has the authority to organize the budget and gives special expenses to prosecutors. Article 32 of the Government Organization Act stipulates that the Minister of Justice controls the affairs of the prosecution and others, and has an office of the prosecutor's office as part of the ministry. In the related statutes, the Director of the Attorney General of the Ministry of Justice is in charge of arranging and allocating the prosecution budget. The budget for special expenses for the Justice Ministry next year is 23.8 billion won. The budget for investigating prosecutors ' office is set aside some 14 billion won. Former prosecutors said there were similar practices in the past. Since the special expense for the prosecution is for investigation support, the Justice Ministry could not use it, so the Justice Ministry gave us (the special expense for the minister's share) to pay the prosecution. It seemed an old practice, not sure when. The prosecution did not send special fees to the Justice Ministry. I don`t think it was a big deal, although I can not remember the amount of money (of taking away the share of the minister from the prosecution), said a lawyer who was a former justice ministry official. Prosecutors in Seocho-dong said, "" We need to improve the practice of enforcing special expenses in accordance with the law. "" The ministry explained that the practice is now gone and that the minister does not touch the budget allocated for special housing. A ministry official said, I understand that the justice minister does not receive any special expenses from the prosecutor general Moon Sang-key, adding, I currently have a budget item (not a special expense) to finance the project. According to the Ministry of Justice, the estimated cost of the minister's work is 45.68 million won in 2013, 46.74 million won in 2014, 42.77 million won in 2015, 3.59 million won in 2016, and 37.71 million won in 2017.

"The plan is to replace the first 3,000 buses by 2026 after the trial replacement of the 30 cars is scheduled to begin next year (Seoul City is also planning to replace all 4 natural buses each year). Seoul City is aiming to supply 100,000 electric cars by 2025. The Seoul Metropolitan Government announced on July 23 that it would replace 3,000 CNG buses with electric buses by 2022 and 2025, including the 30 CNG buses that are out of service in 2018. The other 4,400 buses will be replaced annually from 2026, and all buses in the city will be turned into electric buses. To that end, the government will provide the infrastructure for charging the electric buses, and install the 16 fast-charging machines for electric buses next year, along with the supply of the slow charging device. Four central Seoul charging stations will also be built by district. The city will start the electric bus business next year because of the introduction of vehicles that can go more than 300 kilometers on a single charge. Until now, electric buses could only run 100 to 200 kilometers in one filling, making it difficult to operate long distance routes. However, the city is concerned that the high cost of one electric bus is between 450 million and 500 million won, making operators reluctant to participate in the project, citing the burden. The city government plans to provide 200-300 million won, including 100-150 million won, for national expenses and disputes. Bus operators must pay more than 200 million won per electric bus. However, the current CNG bus costs just over 200 million won, so a bus operator pays about 100 million won per CNG bus. Currently, the operators have an additional burden of more than 100 million won per CNG bus compared to a CNG bus, but electric cars do not have any fuel costs, as they cost little, a city official said. The city began converting diesel buses to CNG buses starting in 1999 and they were all replaced in 2012.City officials said one of the biggest causes of fine dust in the city was city buses, which they replace with electric buses to improve air quality and create comfort levels by reducing harmful air pollutants.New Sun Jong journalist hanuli@munhwa.com[ Go straight to Culture datkeom [Copyright munhwa.com grew in number two times faster than the previous month's limit of lending by Korean households by illegally redistributing and redistributing their debt than last year's 5501. Korean household debt topped 1400 trillion won, marking another all-time high, reporter Seo Jae-hoon said on spring@hankookilbo.com Although debt growth has slowed slightly this year from last year, the figure is still more than double that of disposable income. The government's measure to curb the debt owed by the sector has decreased the debts of the two financial institutions (mutual finance, savings banks, credit associations and community savings banks), but the increase in mortgage loans at banks continued, and the credit bubble has soared to record levels. The countdown to higher key interest rates has raised fears of a debt bomb, the nation`s biggest detonator. According to the Bank of Korea's ' household credit during the third fiscal quarter ' on July 22, Korea`s household credit rating (household loans plus credit card payments) exceeded 148 trillion won as of the end of September, the first time exceeding the nation's 1,400-billion mark. Despite the government's restriction on lending, the household credit increase in the third quarter (31.2 trillion won) was larger than that of the first and second quarters (28.8 trillion won). However, the rate of increase of household debt is decreasing slightly compared to last year when the loan growth rate was steep enough to exceed 10 percent. Compared to a year ago, household credit growth rate in the third quarter of this year (9.5 percent) decreased to one digit after the second quarter of 2015 (9.2 percent). However, it is worrisome that the rate of debt increase is still more than double that of income. According to the National Assembly audit data submitted by the Bank of Korea, the rate of household debt growth in the second quarter of this year (10.4 percent) was 2.3 times higher than that of households (4.6 percent). As a matter of fact, we should be able to cover debt with income, but the debt is still growing fast, said Moon So-hwan, head of the BOK`s financial statistics team. The effects of the loan bubble, which runs out of government regulations and grows in volume, are also being felt. Household loans by banks increased 15 trillion won in the third quarter from the previous quarter, while non-bank loans increased by 2.3 trillion won in the second quarter. Analysts say the government strengthened its guidelines to assess credit in the financial sector since March. Instead, the bank mortgage loan, the most important of all household loans, increased (from 6.3 trillion won in Q2 to 8 trillion won in Q3) despite the government's real estate policy. A central bank official explained, "" Before the effects of the government's measures went into full swing, housing transactions were high in July and August, and the volume of apartments to be built in 2015 was concentrated, which led to increased housing loan. "" As the central bank expects the demand for home loans, including the central bank loans, to reach around 3 trillion won per month by the end of 2019, the increase in mortgage loans will continue for the time being caused by the effects of past sales, regardless of government regulations. Kakao Bank's credit loans are also soaring. Net bank lending rose by 2.7 trillion won in the third quarter, or 900 billion won per month. The combined amount of other bank loans rose by 7 trillion won, the highest quarterly figure ever.

"Lee Jeong-mi, head of the ruling Democratic Party and chairman of the ruling Democratic Labor Party, said on July 23, ' Lee Jong-mi, chief of the ruling Workers ' Party's Office of Human Rights Development at dahora83@newsis.com Kim criticized the fact that Lee Guk-jong, a professor at Aju University in Seoul, revealed the status of parasites in Korean soldiers who defected from the country by writing statements such as personal terrorism and crimes against humanity.

"" ironn108@newsis.com> [Year-end settlement successful] As the annual salary of 25 % is scratched up by credit cards and later by using check card, it would be easier to reduce the tax deduction rate for couples who earn less and for those who have to pay more from the end of the year … Asset management experts stress that when financial income falls under low interest conditions, it is important to reduce the amount of lost money through a ' tax reduction ' at the end of the year, and to call it ' refund at the end of January. ' Park Young-ah, an authorized accountant at Samsung Securities Co., advised, "" You should learn a strategy to maximize your return on your investment and apply for the deduction you can receive on a regular basis. "" `` If you're going to seek a setec, it's essential you subscribe to a financial package, such as the dog doll retirement pension (IRP), that gives you a deduction before the end of the year. '' It also provided a summary of the essential service strategies recommended by experts, and the benefits of changing the tax credit for the year-end tax settlements this year.◇ Credit card · check card Strategy The first credit card strategy that can be used in a day and night is to use credit card and check card properly. The tax office said that people can get income deductions only when their credit card bills exceed 25 percent of their annual salary. For purchases less than 25 %, you can not use a credit card or check card or get your tax back. It is therefore advisable to use a credit card with a high discount or point offer before crossing this threshold. From the beginning of the income tax credit, the credit rate is higher than that of credit card. Credit card deductions are 15 % and check card deductions are 30 %. Click on the image to view the graphic news in a larger size. / Until the end-of-the-year settlement of datkeom the maximum credit card deduction limit was 3 million won for everyone regardless of their annual salary. However, starting this year, people can get a deduction of up to two million won if they exceed 120 million won per year. Even if the credit limit is full, the user can get an additional deduction of up to one million won for the payment of the traditional market and the transportation fee of 40 percent for the public transportation.The advantage of paying medical bills with credit cards is that you will receive a double ' medical expense credit ' (15 %) and a credit card credit card credit. A spouse and child who earn less than one million won per year (less than five million won per year if they have only work income) can also be deducted from their parents ' spending on the cards.◇ If you are a working couple, both of you can report the combined expenses of the two in the year-end tax credit. That is why you can get more tax back if you have a good strategy. Assuming that the couple's income levels are in the same income bracket, it is easier to use the card of the two with a greater total income tax credit than the other ; ' However, if the income tax rates are different from each other due to the wide gap in income, the decision should be made based on the tax rates, as credit card companies with higher incomes could have higher deductions.When it comes to receiving a medical allowance, it is also advantageous to pay for it by running the family's medical expenses under a lower total wage. Because the medical expense deduction is only available for an amount higher than 3 percent of the total annual salary, it is recommended to move it to one side and pass the limit.Also, the tax credit for each parent, children, siblings, and other dependents should be carefully taken care of. The targets are spouses with yearly incomes less than one million won, immediate descendants (parents, grandparents, etc.) who live with their children and grandchildren under the age of 20, and their brothers and sisters who live under the age of one. Even children who are not on the family registry due to divorce can receive a personal allowance if they can prove that they actually support their children. Parents who live with their children aged 60 or older who earn less than one million won a year may die this year, but they can still get a deduction from the tax cut at the end of this year.◇ Housing purchase and rental expense deduction must be carefully reviewed and the deduction benefits for housing related expenses should be requested. People can get a 40 percent tax credit on subscription savings for housing, and a 2.4 million won tax credit per year. Lending loans are subject to a reduction of 40 percent of the principal and interest payments, and mortgage loans are subject to a deduction of the total amount of interest. The mortgage loan should not have been houseless at the time of the loan, and the price of the home obtained by the loan should be less than 400 million won. The combined three can be deducted for a yearly limit of 5 million won.There is also a monthly rent credit. The annual salary is less than 70 million won, and the maximum deduction for houseless household owners is 10 percent with a limit of 7.5 million won. To apply, one has to be reported to have moved in, and needs a documentary proof that he or she has paid in a monthly rent, including a copy of the monthly rental agreement, a copy of resident registration, and a cash receipt or an account transfer receipt.◇ From the end of this year, monthly rent deductions were made for apartments that were under 85 ㎡ until last year. However, starting this year, the monthly rent at the public institute was also included in the deduction. In addition, monthly rent for the dependents can be deducted not only from themselves but also from their spouses.Last year, the same amount of deductions were also given for the birth or adoption of one child. In addition, from this year, up to 10 percent of used cars will be deducted from credit cards. For the cost of the termination procedure, 20 % deduction rate is applied, higher than the regular medical expenses (15 % deduction).  The United Nations Command, which analyzed images without permission, declared the North Korean Armistice Agreement as a clear :Kim Soo-young will explain in detail what was violated.There are two main violations of the North Korean military armistice agreement.First, the North Korean army descended to the south from the Military Demarcation Line.A group of gunmen who were chasing a fugitive soldier came down to the floor of the Central Nations Supervisory Commission building at Panmunjeom and went back.Since the middle point of the conference hall building is the Military Demarcation Line, it has been moved seven steps in our area.Second, the North Korean army opened fire in our area.Even when the soldier had crossed over to our area, the advance teams continued to fire, and one fell down and fired at the target.The UNC has reserved the judgment of a breach of ceasefire in areas where the North Korean military used AKs.Under the ceasefire agreement, security personnel can carry guns and rifles but can not use automatic weapons because it is difficult to immediately check whether North Korea's armed AKs are automated.The UNSC says the probe was carried out by a four-nation team of South Korea, the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and officials from Sweden and Switzerland, who were members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, observed the process.Chad Carroller, spokesman for the United Nations Command, announced these violations today through a communication channel in the truce village of Panmunjeom and the UNC reported that the North Korean military forces had lost contact with the border ‥.The UNC has proposed meetings to the North to come up with a measure to prevent a recurrence, but no clear solution has been made if North Korea fails to comply.( chwijae Report : Kim Hyung-jong, Video Editors : Lee Jung-taek, CG:Park Sang Only.
