Unlike the United States or Japan, we are even considering closing the exchange : "" If you target a gift exchange, you must admit that you see virtual currency as a commodity with one value. I know it is limited in Japan and I don`t fully recognize it.

"" We need to take risks for those who sell virtual currency, Park said. The Justice Ministry plans to enact a special law to ban transactions on virtual currency exchanges. The plan has been discussed because the related ministries have no objection. The Ministry of Justice, however, says that although it prohibits virtual currency transactions through the exchange, it can not block transactions between individuals and individuals. Responding to the criticism that "" virtual currency transactions can be blurred, "" Minister Park said, "" It may be a matter of concern, but it is a separate matter, "" adding, "" It is not a case that should be argued in any such way. "" "" I will do my best to ensure that no side effects are felt by the government, but I ask you to keep in mind that individuals will not suffer, "" Minister Park said. "" You need to realize this is a very risky deal. "" The government has steadily increased regulations on the virtual currency exchange, such as setting up a task force to regulate various regulations. Financial Services Commission Chairman Choe Jong-koo also volunteered to hold an emergency briefing on July 8 and review all possible alternatives, including shutting down virtual currency dealers in collaboration with related agencies, to minimize side effects. kafka@newsis.com pyo000@newsis.com> Attorney General Preparation…Review the anti-trade bitcons…""Display the international market price of Bitcond by 11.62 % and local market price dropped by 17.82 %, respectively, when the Korean government banned virtual currency transactions with New York and Ahn Ho-kyoon said.Virtual money information provider WorldCordine on 11 (local time) says the day is 4:40 a.m. (GMT) with the price currently down 14.62 % from the previous day's closing price of $ 13.05 million.Bitcone, which closed at $ 10,494 the previous day, started to fall at the beginning of the day and collapsed at 4:20 a.m., leaving its price at $ 13,000.The global market was shocked when the nation's Justice Ministry announced plans to block virtual currency transactions with the Special Law on the Foreign Exchange and shut down the exchanges.Justice Minister Bahk Sang-key told a news conference yesterday, We are preparing legislation to ban transactions on the virtual currency exchange and even closing the exchange. We are working on various measures with related ministries and will soon be known.As a result, the overall global virtual currency market has declined sharply.The dollar drop (- 4.50 %), ripple (- 11.13 %), Bitcone Cache (- 14.07 %), Cardano (- 19.58 %), and Light (10.96 %), and coin (- 12.96 %).The government has even mentioned the transaction ban and the closure of the exchange following the tax audit of the exchange because the domestic virtual currency price is 50 percent higher than the international market price, and the market is seriously overheated.Accordingly, the coin basket case of the virtual currency information company excluded the price of the Korean exchange when calculating the price indexes on July 8. The price difference between the Korean market and the international market was excessive. In Korea, virtual currency is very speculative and similar to gambling, the CNBC said, referring to the fact that the virtual currency price is higher than that of other countries and therefore the price premium for kimchi is higher.After the government's announcement, the price of virtual currency in Korea dropped significantly.Bitcone prices have dropped 17.82 percent to 4.45 million won at the current close of the nation's largest virtual currency exchange. However, the figure is still about 27 percent higher than the international market. ahk@newsis.com>"
"Well-tuned ' everyday illegals ' are prevalent throughout society. The reality is that the authorities virtually let it go so people can not feel guilty while committing an offence. The fight against massive structural evils as well as the efforts to improve the ' ill effects ' of life is a major challenge to raise the standard of our society. The government should devise proper enforcement measures or change the legal system to fit the reality.Cash and credit card payments are marked differently at a clothing store in Seoul. / Photo : Han Min-seon, a 60 year old journalist who recently had an implant surgery at the dentist's office, was offered a one million won discount for cash payment. I know the hospital was trying to avoid paying taxes, but Yoon, who was burdened with millions of won in treatment costs, finally decided to pay cash.# Each Underground Shopping Center at the Seoul Express Bus Terminal has the words "" cash price "" on its side. When asked whether it is paid by credit card, the owner of the clothing store pays 2,000 won more. There is nothing left to receive. "" The so-called cash discount "" practice is illegal, but it is prevalent in all industries. In some cases, the store checkout counter has the operator's account number on it. This is to enable customers to receive and discount their account via smartphone banking in keeping with the current trend of carrying cash.It is a violation of the Credit Expertise Financial Act to provide cash payments to merchants with credit cards. Article 19 Clause 1 states, "" Credit card merchants can not refuse to pay credit card bills or treat credit card members poorly because of transactions with credit cards. "" Violations could result in jail time of less than one year or fines of less than 10 million won. Nevertheless, the reason why the merchants are inviting cash payment is due to the fee burden. According to the Credit Finance Association, the average member's fee is 2.09 percent for credit cards (as of 2016) and 1.6 percent for debit cards. Some companies with annual sales of less than 300 million won have less than a 1 percent commission.There is also a tax problem. It is common to induce cash payment and do not issue cash receipts. This is to pay less tax without reporting income. According to the income tax law, businesses who issue mandatory cash receipts must issue cash receipts without requests when making transactions worth 100,000 won or more. Lee (23), who runs a clothing store in Ulsan, said, "" If I know it is illegal (to pay cash with a discount), I can ask for less cash discount by paying my customers. "" Consumers know this, but they do not think there is any reason to make any objection. Lee, 25, often uses a small clothing store, said, I believe it is illegal to buy cash at a lower cost, so we can benefit each other. Lee said, "" Of course, other vendors I met had never had any related crackdown. "" The Financial Supervisory Service and the Credit Finance Association operate a reporting center, but have little actual reports and can hardly prevent card payment discrimination. The situation is similar in the tax office, which regulates tax evasion. We will continue to crack down on the reports, but it is not easy to prove that we tried to avoid paying taxes, said an official at Banpo Tax Office in Seoul.Since there are not enough investigators, they can identify the suspect when he or she is reported or intentionally misses out on sales. There are not many cases of actual fines.Some say that the tax authorities should be closely shared with financial authorities to protect card consumer rights and tax evaders, and should be able to deal with the regulation process.Cash discounts affect not only card fees or VAT but also income and corporate taxes, said Professor of Tax Administration at Seoul National University, which is close to tax portal. The ministry said the government should focus its efforts on businesses with frequent cash discounts so that they can revive the purpose of the law by hurting the transparency of taxpayers ' money by using their credit cards.What are the articles that the neighbors read now? Get free cartoons and gifts. The government is determined to consider shutting down the Korea Exchange as speculation that is not based on real value. Meanwhile, investors protested the government's reckless approach by accusing normal investment illegally. Amid the government's aggressive move, virtual currency prices plunged one after another. Minister of Justice Park Sang-kee said in a news conference at the Gwacheon Government Complex on July 11 that he would start preparing legislation to close the virtual currency exchange. The current virtual currency transaction is in fact similar to speculation and gambling, said Bahk who said, Price fluctuations and causes are entirely different from other commodity transactions or price declines. We are concerned about the high damage when the bubble bursts. Park`s statement is in line with a set of virtual currency measures discussed at the pan-government task force late last month. Financial authorities announced measures to strictly limit the deposit of transactions funds through other transactions, along with the implementation of the real-name virtual currency transaction system. The government believes the Kimchi Premium, in which Korean prices are too high compared to other virtual currencies, has also become more speculative. Minister Park said, "" The rise of the ' kimchi premium ' in media coverage was also an assessment of the abnormal appearance of virtual currency. "" "" The nation's virtual currency transaction is likely to result in an improvement in the development of industries and individual money rather than in positive terms. ""◇ No regulations, '' a flood of petitions from the presidential office while belated investors have opposed the government`s plan. In the presidential office's public petition, the number of petitions against regulations that began at the end of last month reached 40,000 at about 1:00 p.m.`` People are not fools, '' the complainant argued. `` Because of the current trend of virtual money, it is an investment, not random investment. '' Even normal investors are being criticized by the government as being involved in an illegal speculation panel, the public said, I think the government is protecting the public, but it is taking away our dream. Petitions are also growing to dismiss Choi Jong-koo, the Financial Services Commission Chairman and Choi Heung-sik, who are in charge of regulation of virtual currency. “The password, currency investors, officials say Moon Jae-in, not a beast The core support group that created the president the people,” is writing a petition creator the full range of pressure, saying it.The government rally. ◇ Shockered virtual currency and closing of the Korea Exchange are threatening to hit the Korean market with virtual currency falling 20 %. According to the Korea Virtual and Monetary Exchange's largest Bitcone Exchange, the most expensive coin on the market fell nearly 20 percent per coin as of 2:30 p.m., collapsing the 18 million won mark. The price of the dollar has decreased by more than 26 percent and the ripple has decreased by more than 24 percent since the last month when the rate of increase was higher than 300 percent. Other virtual currencies also experienced weakness, falling 25-30 percent. The price plunge in Korea, a major virtual currency market, has also affected the global market. According to Coin Desk, a virtual money market, after Minister Park's remarks were announced, the price of Bitcone dropped more than 12 percent, creating a shock wave. Korea`s virtual currency transaction is similar to gambling, the CNBC said, Korea`s bit-coining price is called the kimchi premium because it is 31 percent higher than the world`s average price.

(KEPCO) is deeply distressed to think of training for new employees. Although he achieved his dream of entering public corporations through the frozen job market with envious eyes around him, he had to receive a cold reception while wearing a military uniform from his freshman year of employment. Because the training program included a Marine unit training camp for one night and two days. "" I get a good training from the beginning of my freshman year, and I felt like ' I got hired or I enlisted '. We put our raft on our heads and were reprimanded, and the military also took a strong lepellow to carry out the drill, said the training manager, who said, ' It's all over my mind. ' B, who joined POSCO, has similar memories. When I joined the company, I went to the Marine Corps camp for one night and two days. Some of the new female employees collapsed due to breathing difficulties, said, I heard that later there were riders who skipped camp and the training intensity was weaker than it used to be. ▽ Kim Hoe-ryong, journalist of Korea Physiology and Control aseokim@joongang.co.kr] = The payment of contraceptive pills recently sent 100km to new employees and the employees of Kookmin Bank were still criticized for providing birth control pills to new employees. Regarding this, some argue that the way to emphasize mental abilities rather than the education for the improvement of job performance is outdated. The majority of new employees are averse to excessive physical training that has nothing to do with their job performance or work. However, it is hard to complain openly because it was immediately after joining the company. As seen in the case of Korea Electric Power Corp., some public agencies have continued to provide marine camps for new employees and middle management, or are still in place. Korea Electric Power Corporation recently removed the Korean Marine Corps from the camp in 2017 when it launched its own Marine Corps camp. We were told recently that the training sessions were conducted to strengthen teamwork and mental strength, and that despite the fact that they were not physically difficult, they were not rejected by new employees, said an official at the Korea Electric Power Corporation. New employees of Kookmin Bank are on a march on June 2 last December. [capture of KB Kookmin Bank YouTube] Last year Hyundai Automotive Group, Korea Investment & Securities, and others operated a hiking program on Mt. Jiri Mountain and Mt. It was a 12-hour climb training that started at 4 a.m. and ended at 4 p.m., or a 2-day march that left at 7 a.m. the following day. It was a forced march not seen with light hiking, said C, who attended the training camp, recalling that ambulances followed in some areas. There were some motives for getting first aid for the leg injury, he said, It does not seem to correspond with the recent trend that stresses creativity. Another participant D said, I do not have to go hiking but I can not but see the difference between march and job performance, as I can not see the sense of the choice. Hyundai Motor public relations team officials said, We don`t have to work hard to explain the various professions, so it is not necessarily a good idea to work together or to explain the difficulties in getting over them, and we are conducting a hiking program. But since most of the new employees are new to the company, they usually take part in it, he added. The controversy over training new employees is not new. Last October, 64 new employees of Daegu Bank experienced a 100km march. In 2014, Shinhan Bank forced its new employees to recite Dosan Ahn Chang-ho while riding on their feet, sparking a controversy. It has become an annual event that can be forgotten once in a while, but the behavior of businesses has not changed much. According to a survey (allowing redundant responses) conducted by Job Korea, a job portal, about 960 new employees were "" needed "" in February last year. However, they say the first reason for the necessity of training new employees was ' Because we can learn basic knowledge ' (66.7 percent). In other words, they believe that training programs related to enhancing the capacity of the office are necessary. Meanwhile, 54.5 percent of the respondents who said they did not need training, answered ' I don't think I would have anything to do with actual work. ' Experts point out the need to change corporate perceptions following the controversy. They say that the government should improve the military culture by reducing the number of days spent in the march, forced group hiking, and Marine camps. An HR representative from a large company who wishes to remain anonymous said, "" I understand that most executives at the executive level and above must have been disciplined, but in reality, they should have been disciplined, "" forcing employees to do so. In reality, companies that have military training programs all say they have ' chosen their own '. The bank, which was hated by public opinion, explained to female employees about the situation and provided contraceptives at its own request. But the participants said they were given birth control pills by the HR team to control the menstrual cycle during the training. Social science professor Lee Byung-hoon at the University of Central and Central Studies said, "" What happens with the military awards and the neglect of individual creativity and initiative. "" "" It is not about originality, but about the values of today's 4th industrial revolution, an independent society. "" Kwon Soon-won, business administration professor at Sookmyung Women's University in Seoul, said, "" Military training is unimaginable at U.S. or European companies and a corporate culture that has disappeared even in Japan. "" "" In fact, some of the organizational cultures we needed were able to grow in perfect order during the era of industrialization. "" Even if we received blind loyalty and military collective education at the time, it`s not what we are doing, adding that companies should worry about how to cultivate their employees ` creative prowess.

"- "" Reducing the volume and frequency of transactions "" mainly through the KSPO. - The inter-party transaction committee is negative even on the allowable policy and taxation issues. The Ministry of Justice, which has led a special task of shutting down the virtual currency exchange, is planning to do so as soon as possible. However, the question is how to overcome the backlash from virtual currency investors estimated at 3 million. Some also point out that the ministry made a hasty announcement without taking into consideration the consequences of the lack of agreement between related agencies.The state-led, tentatively named government law for closing the virtual currency exchange is the abolition of both the exchange and its transactions. The Ministry of Justice believes that since the virtual currency exchange is currently carried out mainly through large exchanges, removing the exchange in Korea will significantly reduce the size and frequency of transactions.The Justice Ministry is even considering applying the criminal law to open up a gambling space on the virtual currency exchange. As much as virtual currency is defined as gambling, the amount of space in which transactions occur is considered to be gambling. However, it is determined not to block the virtual currency transaction between individuals (P2P). The Justice Ministry announced it would ban transactions entirely from the beginning of last year amid controversies over virtual currency, but eventually retreated to stricter regulations, including the introduction of taxpayers ` money to different economic agencies. However, it is analyzed that the Ministry of Justice has reinvigorated its plan after overheated speculation cases such as the recent virtual currency market by teenagers was brought to the fore. Justice Minister Bahk Sang-key told a news conference at the government headquarters in Gwacheon on July 11, The ministry has been negative about the virtual currency transaction since the beginning, and continues to convey the ministry`s view to relevant agencies. `` Taxation may be misleading in the direction of admitting transactions. It is irrelevant to the government`s accreditation of the exchange due to taxation, stressed the ministry.The Justice Ministry has already set up its own bill and can submit it to the National Assembly at any time. However, the ministry said that it needs to coordinate with related agencies, such as preparing measures to protect the Korea Exchange from being shut down.The ministry plans to propose a special law to close the exchange with government legislation, but is concerned that it could lead to months of advance notice, public hearings, review by the Ministry of Justice and a Cabinet meeting. I will do it in a swift manner, said Minister Park Sang-gi. The government may also propose a bill via ruling party lawmakers to speed up the process. In addition, the investigation and crackdown will be strengthened by mobilizing the related agencies before legislation. Prosecutors, police and the Financial Services Commission will jointly detect transactions that will abuse the market speed, such as stock market.Police are already investigating the services of Coine, the nation`s third-largest virtual currency exchange, by charging it with starting gambling. Profit deals are a way for investors to lose or win money according to the result of choosing to sell or sell at a discount rate of up to one week. Police judged the deal as a gamble based on gains and losses resulting from the accidental victory or defeat.The National Tax Service is also known to have conducted on-site inspections into the nation's largest virtual currency exchange, the Korea Exchange. The actual passage of the special law by the National Assembly does not seem easy. According to the presidential office's Web site, more than 1,000 messages were posted on the petition against the virtual currency restriction measures as of 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Whether the National Assembly will pass the bill despite strong protests from virtual currency investors is crucial.Some say that the exchange closed down on the Korean government's part on the Korean Justice Ministry. Kim Dong-yeon, deputy prime minister and minister of finance and economy, said after a meeting with government officials at Seoul National University, "" The Ministry of Justice asked whether we would close the virtual currency exchange. "" As the other reporters asked one question after another, we should go down (to Sejong).Currently, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Financial Services Commission, the Cabinet Office and the Bank of Korea are participating in the task force. A ministry official involved in the TF, drew the line, saying, The closure of the virtual currency exchange is the ministry`s opinion that the Justice Ministry has so far stated. The final decision will be made after discussion and coordination by each ministry, said Yoon Young-chan, senior secretary for national communication. A presidential official also said, "" It is the stance of each government department to announce today that it is the government's stance on virtual currencies such as Bitcone, and it is not the government's single measure. "" There will be different positions by related ministries, including the Ministry of Finance and Economy and the Financial Services Commission, he explained. What are you reading now?"
"Gravity, a movie about a woman who catches fragments of rockets, broken satellites, and other objects around the Earth with more than 10cm and drops the atmosphere with heat and removes them with friction, returns to the universe to the Earth. The main character of Hubble Space Telescope is suddenly moving out into space when pieces of a satellite that flew over the Earth collided with a spacecraft. In fact, a satellite recently crashed into the glass window of the International Space Station. Even the smallest pieces of debris could hit the machine at a speed of more than 25,000 kilometers per hour, creating an emergency. In 2012, the International Space Station (ISS) was also moving an orbit around to avoid collisions with aerospace waste.Space nations have declared war on space junk. If space security is not secured, everyday technologies such as space exploration, communication, navigation, and weather forecast provided by satellites are useless. Since Sputnik satellite launched in 1957, thousands of rockets, satellites and their shards have created a giant dump that roamed the Earth. Recently, various cleaning techniques have been developed that will dispose of space waste, including robot arms, harpoons, electric sticks to nets, and geckos.◇ Satellite B with four sets of space cleanships = Next month, Frost Technologies of the United Kingdom will ship a remove-sized Limov Debris satellite to a Space X freighter bound for the International Space Station. Frost technology was established on the British island of Sungdae, famous for satellite technology, and is now incorporated into Airbus as a subsidiary. The Remove satellite tests the space waste cleaning technologies that have been developed so far. First, the tiny satellite, which is about the size of a brick, is sent into space. The Remove satellite launches a net to capture space junk when its microscopic satellite falls seven meters away. The technique of capturing space waste is also tested. The cameras and lasers are trained to determine the size and shape of tiny satellites that serve as space waste.The third is the harpoon test. Stretch out your 155-meter-long robotic arm with a target of 10 cm2 on the top side of the satellite, and then shoot a harpoon to make sure it is met. The final experiment is the final disposal of waste space captured with various cleaning techniques. Satellites are made of 10- ㎡ in carbon fiber type bow. Brake system that slows down the satellite As the satellite falls into the Earth's atmosphere, it will burn with friction."" Space developers have agreed that they will use space technology to dispose of dead space satellites as space junk in the next 25 years, "" said GugrI El-Agrietti, director of the Center for Space Research.◇ Robot Arm Defectives Development of Space Waste Removal Technology - Various cleaning techniques are being introduced to remove the junk moving around the Earth. Robot Arm Developed by Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. The Federal Institute of Technology of Lausanne in Switzerland has developed a technique of holding space junk in place with the clawle-shaped robotic arm that goes into a doll pulling machine. But in space, a robotic arm or a harpoon can be blown up in a completely different direction than capturing space junk with a little effort.Scientists at Stanford University published a technique last year in the journal Science Robotics that solved a problem in robotic limbs with the soles of lizards.

"Although the committee did not promote the apartments management office that require people not to feed the senior citizens, it has not promoted the ` Kara ` screen capture. Please refrain from feeding animals that would harm the residential environment ..., a Seoul apartment management office in Yongsan posted a notice last November saying, "" Do not feed wild animals. "" It causes a lot of inconvenience to residents due to car damage, piping damage, environmental pollution and safety accidents. In December, it reiterated the threat of environmental pollution and the destruction of facilities by caring for senior citizens, saying, "" It is not possible to eradicate the problem. "" The first time the letter mentioned pigeons, however, December's narrow gate made it clear that the target is a "" road hog protection activity. "" The announcement was made on July 9 by Kara, an animal rights group.Those who are against the practice of caring for the elderly often use the same logic as the patriarch, which says ' other residents are affected. ' But the informant who had been working on the cat shelter said, "" Because they had "" eliminated two undetectable ones, they had all TNR (neutralized) and were unable to breed, their populations decreased. ""Whether caring for the elderly is hurting other residents is actually a long-standing debate. If the problem is not properly cleaned, such as the cat's food being left unattended on the roadside, there is still room for conflict resolution. However, some argue that even when volunteers try to reduce their populations by cleaning as well as by doing a neutralization procedure, cat care itself is causing trouble for other residents. In such cases, it is difficult to resolve the conflict.Kara visited the apartments in Yongsan, Seoul, where they actually looked into what they say are ' rotting remains of food ' : street climbers, birds and pests.Kara activists identified five birds during an hour of watching. Moreover, it appears that the number of birds is being controlled by the cat by the gill cat, as it is found to have hunted birds in two of the jars.Is the harm caused by corruption in food given to high - ranking officials? Kara activists found the Danjang Jungja, the place where the "" catecokers "" here serve food for the cats and sisters. Kara activists found no evidence of cats, let alone food residue, pests. Kara calls volunteers who take care of the street cats ' caretakers ', not ' cat moms ' or ' cat dads. 'Kara activists also looked through windows and pipes of apartments's basements to find out if the claims of damage were true, but failed to find any evidence of damage and interviewed security personnel to determine the details. Each of the three guards was seen by chance, "" I can hardly see cats. "" "" Sometimes I could, but sometimes I could not see kittens. "" The apartment has few cats. The answers of the residents and merchants were equally accurate.Kara, after completing the field investigation, requested to suspend the publication of the letter to the management office of the apartment, "" Consider management office cooperation statement unfair and rather causing conflicts among residents. ""Of course, there may be a case of damages to the residents of the apartment, which Kara activists failed to confirm with their inspection. It is also natural to have a good relationship with a street cat. However, efforts to take care of life are worthwhile in itself, and the absence of caring activities does not mean that the strays disappear. Is there any way to resolve the conflicts among the residents surrounding the care of the senior citizens?< Song Yoon-kyung, reporter kyung@kyunghyang.com> ▶ Popularity newspaper [Twitter] < Kyunghyang newspaper (www.khan.co.kr), Former KBS announcer Chung Mi-hong said, "" [View popular free cartoons] and redistributive. © 1 News and 2017.3.8 munyoan news 1 news (= 1 News, Seoul, Korea) a reporter Yoon Da Jung Park Geun-hye, former president's impeachment and acquittal at the forefront of the needs which I an announcer kbsJeongmiong, Moon Jae-in is (female and 58) his wife Kim Jung-sook, the president of all been given the public prosecutor on charges of spreading false information about Mrs.Jongno Police Station in Seoul announced on July 11 that it would send Jeong to prosecutors on charges of violating the Information and Communications Network Act (defamation with respect to be considered false) on July 12.Chung wrote on his Facebook page on Oct. 1 last year, "" The first lady is falsely accused of receiving public resentment and earning a false reputation for spending hundreds of millions of dollars on clothes in her inauguration day.

"- Two-digil decline : Ripple, half dollar down market price in five days … and the price of coins dropped to under two dollars this year's first dollar limit. Removing the so-called kimchi premium from the international market, coupled with the ongoing restraints from Asian countries such as Korea and China, has chilled market sentiment. Ripple, who was in the spotlight as the second beat coin, was reduced to semi-tomanic in five days. According to the Korea Exchange's largest cipher currency, Bitcone, as of 8:33 a.m., its price dropped by more than 11 percent from 24 hours ago, requiring about 20 million won in emergency payment. Ripple stayed at 2700 won, falling nearly 16 percent. Other than the "" bit-coined cache, "" which rises 4 percent, the rate of decrease of two digits is falling to the dollar, light coin, dash, and Monet. The same is true of foreign markets. In the Polonix, the dollar ripple mark fell 4.85 percent from a day earlier to $ 1.92. Prices, which had gone up to $ 3.84 on July 4, have dropped more than 50 percent. The price range to determine whether the long-term upward trend has collapsed is expected to be around $ 150. If this price is not met, the price can be decreased to $ 0.50, but if it is supported, a rebound to the $ 3 level is expected. However, the price of a coin rose nearly 2 percent to $ 10,4590 in the coin base, narrowing the gap to $ 4,100 from the domestic comb market. It is seen as a sign that the premium for kimchi is relatively declining, excluding the local bourse. The day before yesterday, the Korean government even launched tax investigations into major trading agencies, including the Rain and the Khinwon, and pressured Chinese authorities to submit secret money mining strategies to the Inner Mongolia district, where secret money mining agencies are concentrated. Chinese authorities said that the agencies encouraged speculation by consuming huge amounts of resources, calling it a threat to the financial system. In particular, as Chinese regulations are tightened, it is feared that the change will have a negative impact on the coin market. Philip Gradwell, chief economist at Chinalisis, said, "" It usually takes about 14 days to get the market to reflect the bitcons ' creation, "" and added, "" If the Chinese government really cuts off mining power when it's too high, it's time. "" `` It is very difficult to estimate how big the impact is, '' he said. `` It can take weeks or months for the market to stabilize again. '' Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett, who is called the investment wizard, also warned that the cryptosyllable and other cipher strengths could eventually come to a bad ending. Buffet told CNBC about the recent boom in investment in Bitcone and encrypted currency, Almost certainly, they will end up in a bad way. But I don`t know when and how it will turn out, he added. "" If I invest in encrypted currency personally, I wouldn't buy a bet I've made in five years or so. "" But I have never invested in cipher money. Still, optimism about the encrypted currency remains. Co-founder Tom Lee, who also serves as a pundstrate global advisor, said in an interview with CNBC, "" The cryptographist market is currently in the process of finding the price again, and the bill for the bit is twice as expensive. "" He had previously forecast in August last year that the Bitcone price would exceed $ 6,000 by the end of the year, but in just three months, it exceeded $ 10,000. Last November, he also presented a strong outlook for Bitcone. Young people, Lee said, are particularly prone to long-term investment in beatcoins. In addition, Jacques PandI, Charles Goldschmelberg and Goldman Sachs Stratigist wrote in their report on the same day that the financial system could be in trouble or that it could be replaced by a "" bit-coined, "" or an alternative credit facility. In particular, the recently promoted encrypted currency of Venezuela would be considered an asset similar to gold and other jewelry.Lee Jeong-hoon (futures@edaily.co.kr) The virtual currency exchange is on the police's line, and the National Tax Service has begun a tax investigation. As new crimes related to virtual currency became rampant, prosecutors began investigating techniques. Financial authorities imposed a virtual money transaction ban on employees. The National Tax Service has begun a tax probe into the nation's No.1 virtual currency exchange, Rain and Coine, the third-largest lender. National Tax Service (NTS) employees carried out an on-site investigation at Coinwon and Bitsom headquarters on July 10. Coine is also under investigation on suspicion of violating the Capital Markets Act at the Cyber Crime Unit of the southern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency. Coine provided its members with a price-predictable profit transaction service that would allow them to trade in up to one week. It is a structure that makes profit when the forecast is correct and deals with specific prices in advance. Police say they have no prior approval from the financial authorities and believe that there is a problem in the sense that it is similar to gambling. "" We have confirmed that it is not against the law, "" he explained. The Cyber Crime Research Association of the Supreme Public Prosecutors ' Office held a seminar on Monday to discuss ways to track down the profits of criminals hidden through virtual money. In addition, financial authorities are conducting a high intensity investigation on the virtual currency exchange. When the commercial bank blocked the issuing of virtual accounts, it caught sight of the fact that some exchange offices operated with a large amount of investment funds using corporate accounts. It is possible that they were vulnerable to accidents such as hacking, and the procedure for verifying their real names was insufficient. Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that the Jabbit, who is known to have lost 17 billion won in hacking, is in the process of selling the company. At first, the Yoobit had announced that they would file for bankruptcy, but changed their stance. Most of the members are in favor of the sale, Yoobit said, adding, We have been negotiating since last August and a hacking scandal broke out. Financial Services Commission Chairman Choe Jong-koo said on July 8 that "" there is a suspicion of a fabrication "" against computer accidents, including frequent hacking by the Korea Exchange. I believe we are not doing any virtual currency transactions, Choi said at a recent meeting with financial regulators. If you are doing so, you should not do it anymore, he was quoted as saying.naa@kmib.co.kr[ cocoa to my friend press naseongwon ] [Facebook] [covering daeaengso with a whistle!)

Firefighters carried out a report on the outbreak of giant icicles at six locations in Seongnam, Yongin, and Hwaseong, where they were first reported to have been eliminated at dawn. In Busan, the cold snap froze over the beach. Outside of Oryukdo and IgI University in Nam-gu, Seoul, waves frozen over the water and covered the rocks with frost.▽ The electronic bulletin board of Jeju Airport was packed with warnings of cancellation and strong winds = Because of heavy snow, traffic was blocked in 10 areas around the country including Jeonnam and Gyeongnam due to the snowstorms, and six national park Jiri and Naejangsan trails were closed.

"The Small Fire Service admitted its mistakes in the process of responding to the Jecheon Sports Center fire, which happened on December 21 last year. Regarding the reason why the fire was caused by the disaster, he said, "" It is vulnerable to structural instability, poor safety management, and poor response by rescue teams. ""The joint fire brigade announced the results at the National Defense Agency on July 11. First of all, the swift initial response and appropriate judgment on the situation did not neglect to guide the generals who should do their best to enter the fire or save lives, the investigators said in an immediate request for a human rescue. As a result, the fire department authorities dismissed the position of the head of the fire department in North Chungcheong Province, and demanded Kim Ik-soo, director of the fire department, and Kim Jong-hee, head of the fire department at Jecheon Fire Station.The investigators also found a combination of structural weakness, poor safety management and inadequate rescue teams to investigate 29 people who lost their lives as the fire spread out rather than out earlier.According to investigators, the filotis building was vulnerable as the blaze spread quickly. The firebox from the first floor of the roof quickly fell onto the car, burning 16 vehicles in no time, and the fragile structure of the PilottI building caused it to expand in flames and in only five minutes.Especially, the sauna on the second floor was set up by allowing flames and smoke to enter the sauna immediately through the transportation elevator room, EPS and pipe ducts, which did not have the proper fire compartments. No employees were available, and emergency alarms were hard to hear in the bathroom on the second floor, preventing them from escaping the scene. The emergency route was equipped with racks, which acted as a barrier. The emergency gate was also closed, causing many casualties.It was discovered that the 7 to 8 story levels were affected by the fact that the sprinkler blocked the system and the smoke screen was secured with a manual lock.In addition, five minutes of ` Golden Time ` had passed when employees failed to evolve their own when the fire broke out at 3:48 p.m. on that day, according to a CCTV recording.Some research results showed that the fire department had problems in responding to the problem. Firefighters spent so much time rescuing people from the third floor windows that they failed to even attempt to get inside during the short Golden Time. The agency replied, It remained too much of a waste in terms of command.It was also confirmed that the propagation of the statue was incorrect when it was not completed. Having discovered that there were people on the second floor, the headquarters's situation room did not announce the situation by radio, but only gave two reports to fire investigators and one to the head of the command.At the same time, the rescue team played a crucial role in getting into the second floor late because it did not use a radio set that many people knew about.Regarding the fact that they did not destroy the second floor, the fire chief said, We were delayed as a result of the fire department reservator`s judgment could put other members at risk.The ministry said it will establish comprehensive countermeasures to prevent a recurrence, including improvement of command capability, improvement of firefighting activities, environment, and systematic preparations of vulnerable buildings.Meanwhile, a big fire broke out at a sports center in Haso-dong, Jecheon City, at 3:48 p.m. on July 21, killing 29 people and injuring 29 others. It was discovered that the building had fire-proofed pilotis, dry-bit enclosures, and fire safety management, including a sprinkler locked, were vulnerable. The fire department's response is also controversial. Firefighters were forced to enter the area by illegally parked vehicles and about 10 victims were killed on the second floor, but the sacrifice was higher due to the belated arrival of rescue teams.▶ subscription channel Asian economies, ▶ 'Military talk' # # in the press bskim@asiae.co.kr by Kim Pong-su. ▶ yangnakkyu < © 5 Kits combine an eye the Windows of the world economy the Asian economy, Asia's economies.Deployment ban unauthorized war damage Daily capacity, Pinnacle Islands ... on fire ' manned nor too hasty to ' Let's make another > (cg) [Yonhap news agency offering tv] (Tokyo, Beijing =, Yonhap News Agency) gimbyeonggyu jinbyeongtae a special correspondent, Japan.The government has sovereignty over the disputed Senkaku Islands (尖閣 junggungmyeong and Diaoyu Islands <釣魚島>) the Aleutian Islands, its territorial waters of adjacent zone just outside of China (from 22 to 44 kilometers offshore).The submarine is to enter the Chinese side protested.

"Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon ordered the government to prepare measures to eradicate corruption in subsidies, and to remove blind spots from the computer system, institutions, and residents (Yonhap news agency), Sung Hye-mi, and Lee Young-hak, the government's investigators. Lee, who murdered a friend of a middle school daughter and purchased a public donation by dumping her body, raised more than 1.2 billion won over the past 13 years and raised the amount of money to buy a luxury car and pay for entertainment expenses. The government confirmed its plan to eliminate corruption in the National Assembly during the 24th annual parliamentary review and adjustment of pending issues led by Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon on July 11. Prime Minister Lee said at a Cabinet meeting in October last year, "" The incident was also a shock to see how many criminal acts were being committed against the molar father, but it was shameful that the government provided a basis for its inspection of how poorly executed subsidies were. "" The government's measures are to first monitor the execution of government subsidies using ▲ Computer System and ▲ and the residents ' authorities ' three-party, and to eliminate "" blind spots in management "" through the government's "" self-operating subsidy system. Currently, the integrated management system has 360 systems, including the Supreme Court's family-related system, but no specific financial transaction information, such as car insurance information, donation collection approval information and high deposits, is included. If the information was linked together, the case could be found. The government linked 12 additional public data to the integrated management system and required the entry of fraudulent information by department while reinforcing verification by supplier selection, execution and post management stage. In particular, 50 patterns were refined to reinforce the verification system while automatic notification of changes in income and deaths was automatically adopted, along with automatic notification function to notify ministries of any irregularities. It also publishes information on supplementary projects worth more than 10 million won. ◇ Inspection and Control by Organizations…""One backfilling system "" The government establishes and monitors "" Uncontrolled Supply and Demand Management Task Force "" to support the Subsidy Management Committee of the Ministry. It also decided to organize ‘ Auxiliary project inspection and evaluation team ’, which is currently at the discretion of 36 agencies, and to induce local governments to set up organizations exclusively responsible for supplying and receiving subsidies in 17 cities and provinces by raising their standard labor costs. In addition, the Supreme Court and the Presidential Commission on Civil Rights decided to dig up ‘ hidden irregularities ’ related to subsidies and provide reports on corruption cases and the data on reporting details. In particular, the Office for Government Policy Coordination's Corruption Prevention and Inspection (KCDC) selected random samples of the four most frequently affected areas, including ▲ Health, Welfare, ▲ Agriculture, Fisheries, Employment, and Education Environment, and conducted a joint inspection with related agencies. The government is set to take strong measures against fraudulent suppliers and government employees who neglected related duties during joint planning and inspection. The current subsidy law includes a clause that disallows the future projects, surcharges surcharges on less than five times the amount of sanctions, and declares a list on the ministry's Web site. The subsidy management committee will report the management office to the Cabinet meetings at the beginning of each year and reflect them in assessment of government services and extension of support projects, and prepare a reward report by each ministry and prepare a reward plan. Local governments should reflect the subsidy management area by attempt into their joint assessment by local governments, and include the management of subsidies in mandatory audit items to conduct an occasional audit. ◇ Monitoring residents ` participation in networks … The local government explains its support to local residents, its plans to prevent corruption, and how to inform individual households, and the residents ` participation budget committee. The plan is to discover the hidden cases of corruption and corruption as well as actively seek out residents who did not receive subsidies. The ministry also plans to expand its current system of national surveillance (446 persons), which is currently installed at the Ministry of Government Administration and Security's Center for Budget and Waste Management, to form a national surveillance team with 40-100 people in 17 cities and provinces. ◇ Regional subsidy management law is being pushed following…The government also plans to set up a management system to manage its own administrative subsidies located in blind areas. To that end, the National Assembly is scheduled to submit a revised bill on the Act on the Management of Local Subsidies, which complements the definition of local subsidies, delivery procedures, and methods for execution and post management under the Local Finance Act. The Act provided a basis for collecting and using related information to prevent the supply and demand of duplicates, for enforcing laws against subsidiary businesses, and for publishing the list of fraudulent beneficiaries. The government will also enact a bill that will raise the limit on the compensation amount for reports on local projects from the current 100 million won to 200 million won. The government is also planning to develop a system for integrated management of local grants and link it to the existing system for integrated management of state and local grants. noanoa@yna.co.kr South Korea's military says it then safely led the soldier south in accordance with a set defection order. But when the soldier told our reporters, the process of defection was very different from that of the military. The military did nothing until it crossed the pan-propelled fence connecting GP and GP.First, I am reporter Lee Sung Hoon.On June 13, 2004, at around 4:40 p.m., a North Korean soldier at the North's military surveillance center in Cheorwon, Gangwon Province, crossed over an iron fence to defect.[Asylond soldier : I'll report to my boss and say, ' I'll keep the trees. ' I took a saw.A went directly to GP, which is the South Korean front guard post, two kilometers south of the station.A climbed up the mountain and came down to the front of the Military Demarcation Line on a crawling hill over an hour. I waved to GP for notice of my intention to defect before crossing the border.[Escape] : You have announced your intention to defect for five minutes. But I didn't see any sign of it (from the South Korean GP).

"Corporate investors are moving to file a suit against Intel Corporation chief executive officer Brian Crocknick, who caused a controversy over a security flaw in the CPU's processing unit. Questions were raised about whether the CEO sold the shares he owned a month before the security defect and made a profit of tens of billions of won, or not, by using confidential information to trade internally.According to the U.S. Business Insider on July 11 (local time), companies at Intel are reviewing lawsuits against Intel CEO Brian Crockernik. Sources close to the news said that institutional investors have already consulted their lawyers to discuss the massive selling of Intel CEOs. Intel may also be questioned by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).Chranik sold all of its available shares and options in the stock market to be sold out with Intel last November, the minimum required amount of shares, which was 250,000 shares before the issue of CPU security broke out. It is known that he made a profit of approximately $ 25 million (approximately 27 billion won).The key issue in the lawsuit is when CEO Chranik first recognized the problem of CPU security, which will seriously damage the company's stock price, and whether the time of suit is related to the massive sale of shares. If CEO Chrenzanik recognizes the bad news and makes profit by selling stocks in advance, it could become problem by insider trading using confidential information. Intel shares have fallen nearly 7 percent since news of chip security vulnerabilities was revealed last week.Intel spokesperson, however, reportedly declined to make any official comment on when the CEO recognized the defects in CPU security.Local news agencies say the wave is unlikely to subside easily as researchers have warned of the vulnerability of Intel chips for several years already and released related research papers.Sohn Seon-hee, reporter of the ministry, sheeson@asiae.co.kr They were released without proper prior notice or agreement. The ministry, which is considering imposing a tax burden on virtual currency, is expected to disrupt the implementation of the policy. Kim Dong-yeon, deputy prime minister and minister of economic affairs, said after a meeting on economic issues held at Seoul National University on July 11, "" The Ministry of Justice shared an answer to Lee Dae-lee, who said that the ministry did not close its virtual currency exchange. As the other reporters asked one question after another, we should go down (to Sejong). Justice Minister Bahk Sang-key told a news conference at the government headquarters in Gwacheon earlier this morning that he is also preparing legislation to ban transactions via the virtual currency exchange, aimed at shutting down the bourse. The Ministry of Justice is seeking a special government law on the virtual currency exchange, enforcing the criminal code against it. Asked whether they held consultations with related ministries, Minister Park responded, We have no objection to the proposal. However, the stance of the ministry was different. Currently, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Financial Services Commission, the Cabinet Office and the Bank of Korea are participating in the task force. A ministry official involved in the TF, drew the line, saying, The closure of the virtual currency exchange is the ministry`s opinion that the Justice Ministry has so far stated. Many of the senior members of the financial services department are in a quandary. It is because they did not see the policy until they saw the news. "" I didn't know the Ministry of Justice announced it would close the virtual currency exchange because I couldn't get an advance notice, "" a ministry official said. "" Because it would make it difficult to assess the tax burden in the future. "" Another official said, Virtual currency areas like Bitcone should be deregulated into areas where Korea has the advantage, such as online games, and the government should personally step up to bolster the industry. The ministry earlier announced last month that it would prepare a new set of virtual currency measures during the first half of this year, with the announcement of the 2018 Economic Policy Direction. Choi Young-rok, director of the tax office, announced on July 4, "" We are reviewing measures to impose corporate and transfer income tax. "" In other words, the government's economic policies to recognize the deal and impose tax on income have been adopted. However, a setback is likely to occur when the Ministry of Justice announced its plan to close down the bourse in just one week. Some say that the controversy over Kim Dong-yeon's passing last year has reignited. Hong Ki-yong, professor of management at Incheon University, said, "" We can not block transactions through foreign exchange. We must consider whether the tax payment will be effective, and whether closing the taxation system effectively cuts off the meaning of the taxation, and whether or not the technology of the future has been sufficiently developed.

"▽ Korea's Minimum Wage Dispatchers : Let's split the minimum wage and share it with the report : "" There is no noticeable example of the mid-sized subway station workers ' entrance ceremony in Seoul. "" The outlook for the start of the race and employment is focusing on the ' reinforcing ' They marched through Yanghwadaegyo Bridge to the soccer field in front of the National Assembly building in Yeouido, urging for a minimum wage of 10,000 won. Kim Jeong-hyo, a reporter at the news agency, said, "" As soon as we enter the era of minimum wage of 7530, we have a fierce backlash. Less than a month after the minimum wage increase was made, reports of job losses and price pressures are already pouring in. Some even exaggerate and distort reality based on gloomy forecasts. Negative public opinion on minimum wage hikes is being delivered as a voice for small businesses and small businesses that are burdened with an increase. Groups representing related businesses are suffering from media calls these days to introduce the grouch of the scene. It is still too early to find a case that shows the aftermath of the wage hikes, and many people are calling for immediate coverage. It is puzzling that the media often quoted the results of surveys conducted more than six months ago as the basis for the fallout from the wage increase, as a result of the survey, as if there were no suitable cases, ※ You can view the graphic larger than the other options. Unlike the hard-worked outcry from some media outlets, a large number of reticent small businessmen and small businessmen appears calmly accepting a minimum wage hike. Small and mid-sized companies in Korea are more likely to see their business outlook improve this year than last year. A recent report by the Korean Federation of Small and Medium Business (KBIZ) showed, ' 2018 Small and Medium Business and Economic Outlook Survey, ' increased by 9.6 points compared with last year (83.1). The index of small and mid-sized companies, which had been falling since 2014, has turned around to rebound. The Korea Small Business Promotion Foundation also conducted a survey of 2,400 small businesses with fewer than five employees and 1,300 traditional Korean merchants last year, and saw an improvement of 86.9 this year from 81.5 last year. A reading below 100 indicates that the ' bad economy ' outlook is better than a ' good economy, ' but a smaller estimate is that the economy will get worse with a minimum wage increase. Small and mid-sized companies are also expected to hire this year. The overall number of small and midsize businesses ` employees this year will continue to grow by around 300,000, as domestic demand picks up, the institute said in a recent report. Bae Kyu-sik, a senior researcher at the Korea Labor Institute, said, The recent loss of workers in some labor markets is likely to have resulted in multiple factors, including the possibility of a lower wage hike. They are also actively established. The number of new companies listed in the Small and Medium Venture Business Division rose 9.7 percent in November last year from a year earlier, setting a new record high in November alone. It is a phenomenon that can not be seen if the economic outlook was gloomy as a side effect of the minimum wage increase. Exaggerated concerns have led to hasty government measures and excessive support. For example, if the additional burden on companies ' labor costs increases than it actually is, the government's measures are more likely to be ignored. A mid-term Korea Central Committee official said, We have been providing job security support to business personnel managers in each industries and regions with high labor costs since November last year, and the requirement is higher than the 1.9 million won per month. A small business association official said, "" As I held a discussion by industry and did not want to sign up for employment insurance, I felt very strongly that I would like to go on without government support. "" The two groups recently told the Small and Medium Business Ministry of this situation and demanded an easing of application criteria and requirements. ※ You can view the graphic larger than the other options. Along with the government's request for proper implementation of job security funds, some say it should be cautious to operate such funds from the ' protection and support ' point of view. Retractable wage support can be difficult to sustain and may impair industry-wide innovation. Roh Min-seon, a researcher at the Small and Medium Business Institute, said, First of all, it is desirable to indirectly support areas that are more vulnerable to the minimum wage increase by boosting their productivity and boosting their innovation capabilities. Also, efforts should spread to the overall industrial ecosystem by providing incentives to large companies to make voluntary efforts to bridge the wage gap.Go directly to the Facebook page of the http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy 4.4.2 Weconomy : Go straight to Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/econohani ▶ Being my Hangers!

"The Department of Transportation (The current Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport) during the 14th president in August 1992, four months before the election is in Seoul gangdonggu, Hanam, Gyeonggi Province, light rail project connecting the surprise announcement. At that time, the Ministry of Transportation did not even investigate the feasibility of the project and proposed a construction plan. Of course, there was controversy about ' election. ' But the ministry dismissed it as having been fully reviewed since the mid-1980s.Since 1995, the basic plan for the Hanam Light Rail Transit project was established. At that time, the target of its opening was 2001. However, no private business owners to participate in the project could appear. It was not until 2000 that a Hyundai consortium was selected as the preferred bidder, but the project was sluggish. It was revealed in 2005 that the KDI published a report titled "" It is reasonable to Close Negotiation on the Hannam Light Rail Transit Project. "" The Hanam Light Rail Transit project tortured Hanam citizens for 13 years until it was scrapped.The Hanam Light Rail Transit was first published in 1992. / It is commonly believed that the investment in areas with favorable conditions for expanding transportation infrastructure, such as subways and roads provided by Hanam, requires watching at least 10 years. The government will set the opening date at 4 to 5 years after starting construction. However, this means most businesses are delayed for one reason or another, eventually surpassing 10 years.A team of reporters analyzed recent cases of infrastructure construction, confirming that the myth is almost true. The date of its scheduled opening and the actual time of its opening have often changed for more than 10 years. It was rare to see such services open as expected.When the number of months of production increases, problems arise. The longer the construction site is left unattended, the worse the surrounding environment becomes. The work continuity is also lost, increasing the risk of faulty construction. As the air increases, the builders get more expensive to reclaim, and the costs finally go to the facility users. Real estate buyers who buy apartments or land, who believe in good transportation, will also have their own problems as the opportunity costs increase.■ The most recent latest-initiated railway between Busan and Gimhae was the one that delayed the construction of the 12.6km railway. The light rail, which connects Busan Sangsa Station to Kimhae Gaya University, was previously approved by the South and North Korea Light Railway in 1995. At that time, the estimated project period was 1995 to 2000 and the target of its opening was 2001.It did not go through the official gazette on December 30, 1995 : "" Basic plan for private infrastructure projects for construction of subways between Busan and Gimhae. / It did not go through various ups and downs, as in Hanam, Korea Record Service's capture. He did not start until February 2006, 11 years after the local residents ' dispute. It was scheduled to open in July 2011 after five years of construction, but was officially opened on September 16 of the same year due to noise problems. It is more than 10 years behind its initial target of opening in 2001.Some projects have not yet scheduled to start their construction, even 10 years after the project was announced. Gwang-gyo to Homaesil section of subway station. According to the "" Project Plan for Double-Range Transit Railway Construction, "" which was announced in July 2006, construction of Gwang-gyo and Homaesil section had to start in 2014. However, out of the previous sections, Migeum station is still under construction, and the project plan is not clear on the project itself due to the excessive benefits.The Incheon Metropolitan Railway Line No. 1, which opened in March 2007, also took about 10 years. The initial forecast was in December 1997, and construction began on July 5, 1993. However, a number of problems occurred, such as the construction of Gyulhyeon and Gyeyang stations along with the construction of Incheon International Airport Railway, and the opening date was extended. In the end, it opened about nine years and eight months later than expected.Line View of New Sections, Including Gwang-Kyo and Homashil Roads provided by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport are more serious than railroads. It takes more than 10 years to open a single short road. Representative fund ~ Hoecheon-Cheon National Roads in Yangju, Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi-do. The construction of this project started in May 1999 and was scheduled to open in 2004. However, due to a lack of budget and frequent design changes, the project was finally completed in December 2015, 11 years later than the original goal. It took 16 years and 7 months for the construction to continue. This means that it was built 720m per year.The World Cup Bridge, the 28th bridge on the Han River, is still under construction seven years after its construction began in March 2010. Seoul city had originally pledged to complete the World Cup bridge by August 2015, but this was due to the drastic cut in the budget for welfare, as the budget was concentrated on the welfare sector after Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon took office. The current target is delayed to August 2020, five years from the beginning. It is unclear whether they can protect even this.The construction of the World Cup's bridge was completed 7 years and 9 months ago on July 12. / It is still 13 years since the construction began on the Subway Line No. 3 connecting Seongnam and Icheon of Yonhap News Agency. The remaining 2,000-2000 km sections (6.1 km) are to be designed this year.■ There are two main reasons why the construction cost of each year is delayed compared to the previous expectation. First, we are short of money. As the total expense is distributed each year, the budget is different depending on the situation. Another cause is uncertainty in the business plan. They start their projects without completing land compensation, which is needed before they can start their construction, and end up dragging down construction.Damage caused by air extension is serious. "" The delay in air quality started with site labor costs, but the cost was not clearly compensated by the ordering office, and the losses were substantial when the work was delayed, "" said an official at the construction industry.Lee Young-hwan, director of the Construction and Economy Research Institute of Korea, said, "" We have to set up a project that is uncertain when we set up an order sheet to secure all of the construction projects together, rather than sharing the budgets every year.

Justice Minister Park Sang-kee held a news conference at the Gwacheon Government Complex and announced a special law on the abolition of the virtual wholesale and retail exchange as well as the removal of all transactions made through existing exchanges with the government. The virtual currency transaction is in a similar manner to speculation or gambling, Bahk said. As the pattern of virtual currency transactions is similar to gambling, we regard it as a gamble, stressed that there were no differences between the related agencies (such as financial authorities) regarding the abolition of virtual currency transactions. The ministry explained that the virtual currency transaction is not based on value, and that the serious deterioration and its causes are entirely different from the price fluctuations in the existing commodities trading. In addition, the government should take strong action because the money needed for industrial capital is being poured into virtual currency and hurt individual mouths when bubbles burst.Minister Park said, "" Even before the bill on the abolition of the virtual currency exchange is passed by the National Assembly, measures related to women's land will be combined with related agencies.

The government will form a joint inspection team of related agencies to eliminate speculative demand and crack down on overheated areas with the highest intensity indefinitely. Kim Hyun-mi, Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, and Choi Jong-koo, chairman of the Financial Services Commission, held a meeting in southern Seoul yesterday to discuss ways to deal with pending economic issues. "" Although the real estate market has become generally stable since August 2 real estate measures, such as Gyeonggi-dong, Busan, and Sejong, it has become more stable, it has become more country-heated and over-priced, "" he said. Apartment prices nationwide rose only 0.02 % during the first week of this year, but Gangnam 4 districts (Gangnam-gu, Seocho-gu, Songpa-gu, and Gangdong-gu) saw a 0.69 % rise. "" This year's housing supply is growing faster than usual, including Gangnam, Seoul, and given the stabilizing housing market in both metropolitan and residential areas, it is hard to say the recent surge in housing prices is due to speculative demand, "" Kim said.Jeong Ha-jong, a reporter at an apartment building in Gangnam (Seoul = Yonhap news Agency) : "" Apartment construction in Seocho-gu is in the process of finishing on July 17 when it was revealed that the price of apartments in Gangnam rose 4.8 percent year-on-year. The government has successfully stabilized speculation by three principles : eradication of speculative demand, custom measures, and protection of residents who need to live in areas close to Seoul such as Gangnam. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport and local governments will form a joint inspection team to crack down on all overheated areas with the highest intensity levels indefinitely. The joint inspection team will organize a separate investigation team to crack down on possible violations of the order of the housing market, including illegal subscriptions, resells, brokerage units, and price inflation. The National Tax Service will investigate tax evasion cases involving the sale of real estate, such as giving irregular gifts to children of children with multiple homes, and file a lawsuit against them when it comes to tax evasion. The ministry will strengthen its policy to prevent tax evasions on non-debts acts, such as security deposits and mortgage loans, when transferring real estate to one's spouse or children.▽ Action of 8.2 One Month and Buy Decline (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) = As Gangnam Apartment Market was closed to speculation after the announcement of measures on August 2, the purchasing price of apartments in Seoul has decreased and decreased sharply. Prices of apartments to be rebuilt in Seoul dropped 0.54 percent in the month following the 8-2 measures. Meanwhile, the Mapo, Yongsan and Seongdong-gu areas experienced a gap between regions and complexes, even though the purchase price has declined for a month after the announcement of measures. A real estate agency in southern Seoul is charged a rental price and a quick sale price on July 3.

It also decided to keep in mind the DTI (New General Loan Rate) and DSR (Total debt principal payment rate) scheduled for the second half of this year, and encourage financial institutions to settle down early. The government also decided to ease the demand for reconstruction by notifying of the age-by-year burden estimates of businesses that apply to the pre-profits scheme in Seoul in May. The location of public housing, such as those in the honeymoon hope town, will be confirmed early this year to ensure uninterrupted supply of public housing by setting up an early stage in 40 public housing districts.

"Surveyor Chung Han-gyeol, Seongbu Branch, and Kim Young-sang Haeng are working hard to revise the law on the effect of paying back home.▽ Image = Jeong Han-gyeol (1329 generation), a reporter in Seodaemun District, Seoul, recently reduced the guard by half. Until October last year, the total number of security guards stood at 47, but since November, it has only been 25. Seven "" janitors "" filled in part of the guard's departure. It is the effect of the revision to the Housing Management Act that prohibited the non-cost services such as parcel management and separate trash collection.According to the report, some apartment guards have been fired after the revision of the MantoudeI Housing Management Act saw a rise in the minimum wage. It appears that the anxiety over hiring security guards is accelerating. The revision to the Housing Management Act last September prohibited residents, representatives of residents ' associations and management offices from giving unreasonable instructions or ordering security personnel to do anything other than work. Under the Act, it was unlawful to have a security office deliver a parcel to the resident's doorstep or to have a security guard do duties such as park maintenance or separate collection.Reacting security guards and hiring managers should replace them as a way to deal with changes in the law. However, not all of the security personnel who are fired can be filled with managers. That is why they can not afford to hire additional staff in the aftermath of the minimum wage increase. The director of the apartment management office said, We decided to conduct a general referendum on residents after the revision to the law and hire a management staff instead of security guards, which is why we don`t have a lot of budget to manage.There are many places that still leave the forbidden work untouched. Security guards say they have no choice but to act voluntarily.Lee (69), who has been a security guard for three years in apartments in Seongbuk-gu (2655 generations), is still in charge of cleaning, separating, and waste disposal. "" The cleaner leaves at 4 p.m. when he sees one missing, "" Lee said. "" I call in a security guard because I don't want to hear that noise, "" adding, "" I don't want to hear it. ""The contract says, From the start, it says, `` words are voluntary (in effect, anti-foreign), '' and `` non-price. ''"" It is practically impossible to rule out deliveries and cleaning of security personnel, "" said the director of the apartment's management office. "" We can not afford to hire a limited salary and pay a minimum wage when we get to the bottom line. ""The unmanned security system has been installed at the entrance of Yonsei University's School and Industry Cooperation Center in Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, on the afternoon of July 9. On the right, a notice of appointment is posted to appoint the existing security personnel.▽ Photo = In some universities where journalists do not live for 24 hours, some use unmanned security systems to replace guards. Yonsei University in Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, has closed down its academic partners and outdoor movie theater guards and replaced them with an unmanned security system. The plan is to increase the number of vacancies created by retirements this year, not by hiring 15, and strengthen the unmanned security system.Yonsei University officials said, "" We closed down the guard post because it is an unmanned security system that can keep schools safe enough without guards. "" "" It is the ninth year of reducing tuition and increasing security costs. ""Security guards are protesting around the universities on which the unions are organized. Cleaning and security workers at Korea University, Yonsei University and Hongik University stopped demanding the "" reduction of staff by employers "" in front of the Employment and Labor Administration in Seoul on July 10.It is quite hard to understand how much money we have to save and restructure our minimum wage bracket, said Choi Da-hye, deputy director of the KCTU's Seokyeong branch.The news report by a neighbor of mine : "" Free Cartoon Report to Be Redistributed by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Economy, Bang Yoon-young.

Ministers ' comments on the minimum wage increase were poured out at this year's first meeting of economy-related ministers, who were appointed by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance Kim Dong-yeon, at the Government Seoulcheong Corporation on July 11. First of all, the statistics showed that the decline in the private service sector jobs last month was attributable to the base-effects and the impact of the difficulties in enforcing some jobs in December, Kim said. The minimum wage had been raised twice to 16.1 percent in 2000 and 12.3 percent in 2007, Kim explained, concerning the stability of employment in the short term.Now that we have created support measures such as job security funds, we believe we will find stability faster.Kim went on to say that the highest level among OECD members, with 23.5 percent of Korea`s workers, was the low-paid, and that the groups in need were paid the optimal wage.Kim Dong-yeon, deputy prime minister for economic affairs and finance and minister of planning and finance, speaks at the first ministerial meeting of economy-related ministers held at Seoul's Seoulcheong District Government Complex yesterday. Would the monthly expenses of apartment complexes be more than 6 million won per pyeong continue to rise, said Kim Bu-kyum, a news nyuseu news reporter and Minister of Public Administration and Security at a time.We should at least get the minimum wage standard now, apart from income driven growth, said the government, which is not to shift its paradigm to live like a human being for the rest of the year.Labor Minister Kim Young-joo also said, Can we live in Korea with 7.57 million won per month, the lowest wage is the lowest cost of living in Korea and is inevitable for solving income polarization. As such, the increased minimum wage has been applied since January, but due to the gap in pay days, we can apply for a job security fund in mid-February, said a statement on the effectiveness of job security funds.Korea has the highest rate of poverty among the elderly among OECD members, said Health and Welfare Minister Park Neung-hoo.47 percent of Korea`s workers aged 60 and older are affected by the minimum wage, adding that the poverty rate would also be resolved if minimum wage increases are implemented and basic pension hikes were to be made this September."
"When asked about 10 virtual phone users, a 28-year-old government official said, "" I have no choice but to ask. He is a new recruit who was appointed last year. It is high time to learn and learn administrative affairs. But there is another place where he is ' keen '. It is Coin. It is a generic term for different kinds of virtual currency. Park is almost entirely a coin zombie. She often goes through the four "" coin dantock rooms "" she participated in. In addition, they check the real time virtual currency rate by accessing the exchange. Last May, he invested 10 million won in a virtual currency that used to be in a negative account. It lost 6 million won in one day. After six months, the losses were reduced to 700,000 won. As of July 10, Park earned about 50 million won. It earned nearly three times the annual salary of a nine-class government employee (based on the salary of 1,880,000 won) in three months. Park, who is working as a government employee and will continue to invest in virtual currencies, said, It is like the older generation is real estate speculation. The virtual currency investment boom among the 20s to 30s is growing. According to Bitshomb and Upbit, the virtual currency exchange, 60-70 percent of the users are in their 20s and 30s. Of course, there are also young people who try to make a fortune at one stroke. However, there are also many elementary school students who want to make a large sum of money such as wedding preparations or housing. The Dong-A Ilbo reporters ' team interviewed 10 people in their 20s to 30s who have currently invested in virtual phone calls face-to-face or by telephone. All 10 said, Virtual calls are a no-no. Still, he said, "" Earth spoons and spoons are the only way to enrich the properties. "" Their parents and grandparents had little to no better than saying, I still have only real estate. Seokmo (31) invested 40 million won last December. I thought it was late, but I made about 25 million won in a month or so. It is a dream for me to buy an apartment and become rich, said Seok. It is not like real estate speculation to avoid dealing with people who are prepared to risk losing money. Heo, 27, invested 500,000 won at the end of last year, but lost 200,000 won. It is similar to gambling, but if I make a million won like real gambling, I don`t lose a million. Rather, it is a problem in this society that makes people need more money than their salaries. Their venture into virtual currency investment is due to the abundant success stories surrounding them. They also dream of success. But no investor would dream of turning around and move on. A 34-year-old office worker, Kwon (34, female) moved from a studio with a rent of 500,000 won per month to a studio with a rent of 120 million won last December. Kwon invested 5 million won in virtual currencies and earned nearly 100 million won in a year. It is hard to collect 100 million won even after 10 years of earning, as he received less than 3 million won a month. Chang (30), who earned 56 million won with a profit rate of 500 percent, also said, I never thought of buying a car to raise money for my wedding, but I bought a small car because of the coins. Virtual currencies are a reality, ' they said. Therefore, he said in unison, "" Regulations need to be strengthened to ensure safe investment. "" Choi (30) said, "" Shares are an asymmetrical part of information and real estate is a capital inequality, but coins are the most democratic and equitable means of earning ' notes ' or ' checks. ' Appropriate regulations are needed, too, for a safe investment.Lee Jee-hoon, journalist of Yoon-sol easyhoon@donga.com (10) the Moon Jae-in president is New Year news conference, the government the reforms, open the possibility of Dujail, a heightened the attention of the ruling and opposition parties. Politicians, in particular, clashed head-on on the timing of the amendment. The ruling DeBull Farmers and Veterans ' Party stressed the need for parliamentary revisions in February to be made to ensure a simultaneous referendum on constitutional reform in June, while the main opposition Grand National Party and the People's Party should not rush.We believe the National Assembly can be trusted if it can break the deadlock over a tiny political maneuver by ending the 30 year time limit for constitutional amendment, said National Assembly floor leader Woo Won-sik at a policy coordination meeting held yesterday morning. We should then overcome the small differences and draw a conclusion to fulfill the National Assembly`s duties, which the people have assigned to us not to have the right to propose a constitutional amendment as the last resort, the GNP said. The president the Government of the lever for local elections, some interpreted as opposition to put pressure on the amendment referendum on the same time skeptical. If the ruling and opposition parties want a parliamentary revision to the constitution, they should start discussing it in the near future.In fact, Rep. Park Hong-keun, the vice floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, also responded directly, Any attempt to delay the timing of the amendment while blaming time will prove to be a self-insurgency. The National Assembly has operated a special committee on constitutional amendment over the past year and candidates promised to vote at the same time during the presidential election. We have had enough time to discuss it. Stress that the referendum on a constitutional revision should be carried out at the same time as the June local elections is part of a major public opinion campaign, which was the mutual pledge of several parties during the presidential election.As the National Assembly must prepare a revision bill by the end of February to vote on a constitutional amendment in June, the main opposition Democratic Party is expected to launch a full-scale tax on when it comes to the amendment. The main opposition Grand National Party protested fiercely. Yesterday morning, Kim Korea Party leader mbc In an interview in radio 'Yang Ji-yeol of a sweeping reshuffle.' and "" his push for a constitutional amendment, Moon Jae-in, to blatantly a declaration of war.See ""and"" a constitutional amendment, the ruling and opposition parties agreed to extend the activities and agreed to continue until the end of June was only 10 days. Nails the same time, vote for the local elections is president passing the National Assembly declaration, pointed out."" In the presidential space, presidential contenders sometimes make unreasonable pledges to win votes, "" he said, adding, "" That's not the case, but it's not a good idea to keep it. ""If the referendum is carried out in addition to the local elections, it can have an influence on the local elections. The National Assembly's voting platform also took a negative note on the revision. Maj. Kim Dong-chul, Uidang-myeon people the floor leader of the policy said as he ""The president is New Year news conference in awareness of the Constitution is very concerning."" at the meeting in March, the Constitution of the National Assembly.Cheong Wa Dae, the government the reforms, saying that it should be set to go if you don't become the foot of constitutional amendment were put into place for it suggests that, said. The ""These problems can minimise the differences between the ruling and opposition parties led by the National Assembly and can increase the chance of success."" and "" a constitutional amendment, led by the president is not resolved the differences between the ruling and opposition parties.There is no choice but to a remote chance of success, claimed. With such a sharp confrontation between the negotiating parties, an agreement to revise the Constitution is not likely to be easy during February. The ruling and opposition parties are also maintaining a parallel stance on another key issue, the power structure reform. The Democratic Party is the second four-year term as president and president, Uidang-myeon Korea and the public, opposition parties, a dual executive system (Semi-presidential system) claim. Against this backdrop, the analysis suggests that it would not be easy to cross the threshold of the National Assembly despite the actual proposal of a constitutional amendment. In fact, if the revision is to be approved by the National Assembly, it requires approval by more than two-thirds of lawmakers who are registered. The current number of DP seats is 121, less than half of the 297 seats. National Assembly Chamber of Deputies."
