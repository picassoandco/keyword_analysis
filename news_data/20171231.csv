If a car equipped with a black box is left for more than 12 hours at a low temperature, it may not start. It is also recommended to leave the wipers in the windshield when it is snowing to avoid freezing. Because of their impatience, they can not get a clear view by pouring hot water to remove frost from the windshield. If you do something wrong, the windshield may break.The Korea Transportation Safety Authority announced on July 31 that it conducted an experiment on winter car management at the Korea Automobile Safety Research Institute in Hwaseong, South Korea. The complex set the temperature of its laboratory to - 18 ℃, and renewed three conditions that occur frequently during the winter.First, the battery's performance after four years of use in a - 18 ℃ laboratory was measured. As a result of the experiment, the car battery's performance decreased after 12 hours of parking at low temperatures, but the car started. However, under the same conditions, the black box was fitted and did not start after 12 hours of cold parking.Lower temperatures also reduce battery performance, as do external devices, such as black boxes, that require permanent power consume more battery. The ' Emergency Action for Battery Charging ' of the last 3 years (2014-2016) announced by the Insurance Development Institute was the highest with 13.4 % in December and 12.6 % in January. When using external devices that need permanent power, such as black boxes, in cold winter temperatures will worsen battery performance, so we should speed up battery replacement in the winter time, said Ryu Ki-hyun, director of the research department at the department.It turned out to be a good idea to turn off the wipers in the snow. In the - 18 ℃ laboratory, the windshield froze 10 minutes after water was applied to the car's windshield using a spray gun for about 20 seconds. The windshield was unable to remove the frost because the wipers were still in place. The wiper was pulled off the windshield by force, but the damage to the windshield prevented it from functioning properly. When it snows, it is hard to get a clear view if the car is parked outside and frozen because the wipers are not turned off, said Ryu.I came out of the office in a hurry in the morning and got frost on the windshield. What if you add hot water to remove it quickly? It turned out to be ineffective. In temperatures below zero, pouring hot water on the car glass would soon freeze in its windows to help secure the view. “heater and heated rear window in order to remove frost, and the wipers shall operate at the same time.” is sort of says, "" The hot water not improve your visibility.Risk that can be broken, and prevent the windows, said.< Park Byung-ryul, journalist mypark@kyunghyang.com> The photo showed Kim Jung-sook having a meeting with her family at Aranwon, a single mother's home, on September 27.

"< Anchor > Suspected by a slowdown in performance, Apple headquarters announced it would support some of the cost of replacing the battery. Although the same standard is applied in Korea, consumers say it is chilly.I'm a reporter for Kwon Ae-ri.This is the name of the entrance notice posted yesterday (July 29) on the website of the reporter > Apple Korea.Apple's position was translated into Korean, and the only thing they said was that they would give us $ 50 and $ 66,000 in our money to replace the iPhone 6 and 7 batteries.If you replace the 100,000 won battery every other year, you will pay 34,000 won.But consumer anger stays the same.[Kim Chaerin / iPhone 7] : I believe it is, but it seems to be the cannibalism that the apology notice. I paid more than one million won and felt bitter because I didn't think much of it.] Apple insists it has never intentionally lost performance.The performance degradation that users experienced was a temporary problem with the software update process and the phenomenon caused by the batteries being worn out.It is seen as a move to respond to a series of global class action suits, with the logic that the device's performance was not deliberately manipulated and was not hidden from consumers.[Park HwI-young / Mass Litigation Preparation lawyer] : Consumers do not acknowledge any of the inconveniences they experienced with (software) updates. No claims or position were made for existing damages.Law Firm, which is collecting litigants in the nation, plans to file a class action suit against Apple Korea within next month. Investors rushed to trade virtual currencies as the price of Bitcone soared. The government came up with a plan to scrap the virtual currency exchange in a belated fashion, but it was not enough to quell the speculative frenzy. Garzia, or the extended version of Gazza, has become the buzzword of the year as investors look for higher prices to hit target prices.◇ New year's price increased 95 times … The rise in virtual currency investment and virtual currency rose not only in Korea but also in the world because of its unparalleled return on investment. Bitching`s price has soared by 16 times this year and that of virtual currency, called the doeraroom, 95 times. It was this dollar that set off the virtual money investment frenzy. It has begun to attract investors by doubling in the short term of May and June. As Bitcone started its upward trend from October, the speculative boom in virtual currencies spread nationwide.▽ Bitcone Rise (PG) [Manufacturing Jo Hae-in] = All people of all ages started selling virtual currency. The number of members of the Korea Virtual Monetary Fund is 25.1 million. The figure rose by 3.1 million this month alone. That means one out of 20 Koreans is investing in virtual currency. The membership of other agencies increases further. Bitcone Zombies also appeared. Since virtual currency is available 24 hours a day, it refers to people who watch the trend of sales with smartphones all day long. The volume of transactions also surged. Monthly transactions at the Billiams, which stood at around 300 billion won in January, jumped to 5.2 trillion won in May, then soared fivefold to 25 trillion won in August and to 56 trillion won last month. The virtual currency craze has also shifted to the stock market. Shares of companies that own or participate in management of virtual currency exchanges such as Omnitel, Biddent, Hanil Vacuum and SBI Investment saw a short-term surge. On the other hand, some analyzed that the fund flowed into the virtual currency market when the KOSDAQ market, which was hot this year, was adjusted. The irrational frenzy surrounding virtual money has been a worldwide phenomenon. In the United States, stock prices jumped 500 percent as soon as the word "" block chain "" was put in the drink maker's name. In China, a Chinese counterpart, Tama, has reportedly begun gambling with Bitcone and North Korea has been eager to cash in.◇ Market transaction order that is not as good as quantitative growth = Although the virtual currency exchange market has shown noticeable growth quantitatively, it is evaluated as having "" problematic "" in terms of quality. Three main exchanges in recent years were the one in which Bitsham, Corbit and Coinwon were the only ones, but with the advent of the new exchange this year, the virtual currency exchange is now 20. The opening will reach about 30 locations. Although only two virtual currencies can be traded in Korea at the beginning of the year, the number of virtual coins began to grow to about 100. Domestic transactions are based on the world`s highest authority. It accounts for 20-25 % of virtual currency transactions worldwide. Rain is ranked No.1 on the World Exchange, while Coinwen and Cobbit hold the top 10.Bitsom Center for Customer Service, however, has little to no system to maintain healthy market order. Because of this, the stock market scandal and the crash occurred one after another, including the hacking of the Yapizoon (Present Yubbit) in April, the leaking of personal information in June, access to Bitsom Server in November, and bankruptcy in December. As speculative investment in virtual currency became an issue and the safety issues of the exchange were also overlapped, existing financial institutions were alienated from virtual currency transactions. Banks no longer provide virtual accounts to the Korea Exchange, and credit card companies have decided to stop offering the service of converting points into bit coins. There was also an effort to make it through midnight. The Korea Block Chain Association Preparation Committee, which has about 40 exchanges and block companies involved, has set out a self-regulation plan that includes the qualification requirements for the exchange and protection of investors and is scheduled to go into effect starting next January. ◇ Government's belated correspondents…The government, which did not recognize virtual currency as a financial commodity by taking out a credit card, came up with measures to curb speculation this month. Government ministries formed a joint task force led by the Financial Services Commission to come up with their first government measures in September, but many say it is a stopgap measure. But 11 Moon Jae-in, president of Chong Wa Dae, after reviewing a virtual currency trends and countermeasures in chief and assistants ` meeting the atmosphere suddenly changed. The government held an emergency meeting of related ministries under the supervision of Presidential Secretary Hong Nam-gi on July 13 and announced countermeasures such as banning the sale of virtual currency by minors and banning financial institutions from holding, purchasing, securing collateral and investing in shares. We will also look into whether profits from the virtual currency transaction are taxed. The Act required the exchange to obtain certification of its information protection management system. On July 28, the "" Special Measures for Virtual Counterparties "" (PG) [Manufacturing Research Center] and the "" Review of the Stock Exchange Close "" were taken out. As the government has explicitly mentioned the establishment of a special law to close the exchange, it is likely to come up with countermeasures with an emphasis on transaction regulation in the future. However, some observers say the National Assembly is not going to discuss the issue smoothly as opposition to the stock exchange's closure is also strong. The ministry has shared a consensus on the irrational overheat of the virtual currency speculation, a government official said during a TF meeting, We will discuss ways to control transactions, including how to close the exchange. pseudojm@yna.co.kr"
"▽ Presentations of fire = Police have identified the cause of the fire and the reason why three children under 4 died in the fire. The three brothers, a mother, reversed their statement and said, I think I was smoking a cigarette.Jeong Hoe-seong, a reporter at the apartment building in southern Gwangju, died at 2:28 a.m. Tuesday at the age of four and a half years old girl. The National Scientific Investigation Unit is entering the scene to find the cause of the fire. The Gwangju Northern Police Station conducted a joint screening with the National Institute of Scientific Investigation on July 31 at the scene of the fire at an apartment building in Duam-dong, Buk-gu, Gwangju. In the 2.5-hour examination, police failed to obtain special evidence or circumstance, including flammable materials, to identify the cause of the fire. The presence of flammable materials could provide indirect evidence of arson. The head of the national team will analyze the collected evidence at the scene thoroughly and determine the cause of the fire, including the ignition point. Meanwhile, boys and girls aged 4 to 2 and 15 months who were found dead at the scene of the fire are presumed to have died from suffocation from smoke caused by fires. A police investigator says soot was found inside the respiratory tract and was breathing during the fire. In the beginning of the incident, the mother of three children said, ' I was drunk and went home and put a pot in the stove to make ramen, but I fell asleep. ' Police confirmed this to A when they found no sign of ramen boiled on top of the stove. "" I thought I'd make ramen when I got home, but I guess I didn't. I don`t remember being drunk. I don`t remember how I turned off the cigarettes, police said. After returning home, he was smoking on the veranda when the weather was cold when he came into the living room to smoke, and his daughter whined into a small room and fell asleep with her daughter in her arms. I couldn't remember how my cigarette was treated. A staff member at the Gwangju Police Agency said, "" In general, if there is an electrical charge, it will slowly ignite. The fire is likely to spread rapidly, and this is not an electrical material, but a flammable fire. "" We will continue to investigate the three siblings ` mothers in parallel to determine the cause of the blaze, police officials said. Apartment fire broke out on the 11th floor of an apartment building in Duam-dong, Buk-gu, Gwangju at 2:26 a.m. on July 31, a 4-year-old girl and her sister were found dead. pch80@yna.co.kr As a result, mass lawsuits by consumers are brewing in Korea as well as the U.S. Steve Jobs, Apple's founder, is famous for never doing any consumer preference research before introducing innovative products such as the iPod and iPhone. The management circle evaluates, We have completely overturned marketing theories based on market analyses. As to why we don`t do the preference research, Jobs said, Consumers do not even know what products they want. We need to look at the products in person to see them. Rather than open communication with consumers, they have focused on developing closed-end technologies. Apple's management philosophy dating from Jobs has been tested with Battery Gate. Apple said on July 28 (local time), "" The slowdown in the speed of its older iPhone (iPhone 6·iPhone 7, etc.) is due to the aging battery and will pay $ 50 per person to replace the battery (60,000 won). "" It has been only a week since consumer class action lawsuits began in the U.S. However, such a response only further raised consumer complaints. About 180,000 people have expressed intent to file class action lawsuits against HannurI in Korea alone until July 31, according to a local law firm HannurI. U.S. federal courts in California filed a class action to file a damages claim worth 999.9 billion dollars (106.8 trillion won), and a French consumer group filed a lawsuit against a law that blocked intentional degradation of technologies. The scandal began on July 9 when an iPhone user raised a question on the U.S. news community's website Reddit. The user claimed, "" Apple changed its operating system (iOS) to slow down the iPhone when its battery charge was low. "" Apple said on July 20 that it has introduced an upgrade to its operating system, which slows down processing, as it loses power if the battery function of an older iPhone goes wrong. The explanation added fuel to the consumer complaints. There was also a conspiracy theory that Apple deliberately lowered the performance of its older iPhone to increase demand for a new iPhone. Consumers said Apple has not "" fully understood the seriousness of the situation "" after offering to compensate them on July 28. The bigger problem is the collapse of the trust of the group lawsuit, which was believed to be the world`s top innovator and not merely device performance. Experts attribute the loss of confidence to three reasons. First, consumers don't understand the idea of Apple's attempt to update its software, which is expected to slow down its device. "" Consumers are beginning to suspect that Apple's entrepreneurship felt alive when Steve Jobs was alive "" said Park Yong-hoo, chief of Fiwaichi's campaign team, "" has explained the underlying technology. "" The second is that the software update did not disclose the pertinent facts before or after the update. Jeong Ok-hyun, an electronics professor at Sogang University, said, "" If I had told you the truth, consumers would have understood it, but covering it up raised their anger. "" Finally, Apple's reluctant offer of a "" battery replacement cost of $ 50 "" solution was not enough to quell consumer complaints. Apple's redress package says that if a user uses an old iPhone and changes the model, the customer can not receive any rewards. The government should pay for battery replacement at least by charging free exchange or refund. Korean law firms, including HannurI & Whimyung, which is seeking to represent a collective lawsuit against Apple, view Apple's actions as a breach of contract with a client, neglecting to take action that could harm the user. Failure to notify consumers of possible degradation of the device after the update was also a violation of the Consumer Basic Law, which requires consumers to provide product information faithfully and accurately. Furthermore, some argue that without client consent, software that reduces product performance may constitute a kind of hacking crime. Samsung Electronics also updated its software to limit battery charge to 30 percent when the Galaxy Note 7 exploded last year without consumers ` consent. Samsung, however, apologized for its actions two weeks after the sale and recalled all 3.06 million units of its products sold. Afterwards, the company stopped producing altogether. Samsung also provided a benefit of exemption of 50 percent of existing terminal payments when the Galaxy Note 7 is replaced with a new product the following year. The company asked third-party agencies to analyze the cause of the product's explosion and inform consumers and the media in detail. "" We can see Apple's behavior as a desperate measure to solve the battery problem, "" said former lawyer Koo Tae-eon, who explained his poor device performance as a desperate measure, however, as a regret over the process. In the end, they point out that in order to restore consumer confidence, the government should discard the closedness in identifying product flaws. Choi Soon-hwa, an international management professor at Dongduk University, said, "" Unique closures and secrecy of Apple have served as positive effects on general users ' expectations and satisfaction with the innovation they need to respond as quickly as possible.

"Park Sang-hyeon, a reporter at the Korean Embassy in Washington D.C. and restoration to Heungbokjeon (Yonhap news agency), is being repaired. It looks like last November 5.Park Sang-hyeon, a reporter at Yonhap News Agency, said, "" The first and oldest pagodas in Korea are to be unveiled in October next year. The Mireuk Temple Site Stone Pagoda was built by King Mu (king of 600 to 641), who led the Jungheung-gi period during the latter half of the Baekje Dynasty, and was the main character of the construction site Seodong-yo. It is a very important artifact that shows the evolution of stone pagoda patterns, with around 2,800 stone pagodas arranged together. However, pouring cement in 1915 at random during the Japanese Colonial Period to breakup, determine compensation allowances for Cultural Heritage Commission in 1999 and changed and it's quite an eyesore. After a thorough investigation and installation in 2000, the company started to dismantle its own facilities in October 2001. According to the Cultural Heritage Administration yesterday, the assembly work to raise the stone to the sixth floor of the Mireuk Temple Site pagoda was completed last November, and the exposed stone face is being strengthened and the color is being fitted."" The stone bricks are to be removed and the piles used to cover or to bond the rubble are to be removed, "" Kim Hyeon-yong, director of the National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage told Yonhap news in March. It takes more time to completely remove the temporary cover and complete the repairs around here, he said, adding that the Mireuk Temple Stone Pagoda, which stands on a wide site in October next year. The institute used the same building materials used during repair. The sides were assembled to be symmetrical, and only part of the east and north were repaired from the third floor to the sixth floor. The previously lost part of the process was treated with cement, and the stone was stacked neatly on top of it. The stone pagodas were so old that they had weakened a lot, Kim explained.In addition to the Mireuk Temple Site Stone Pagoda next year, many cultural assets will be opened to the public. The Korean Legation to the United States in Washington D.C., D.C.Korea, which was purchased by the Korean government in 2012, will finish an internal repair project that will take two years and open officially next May. Built in 1877, it is the only Korean Empire government building to have a one-basement-floor, three-story building. The first or second floors of the diplomatic corps in the United States are reconstructed according to historical records, and the third floor is decorated with exhibition spaces that let visitors know the history of the legation and its history on the Korean Peninsula. Behind the building is a small Korean traditional garden. The Gyeongbok Palace Heungbokjeon Hall will be restored 101 years after it collapsed in 1917. Heungbokjeon Hall was built when Heungseon Daewongun was in the middle of Gyeongbok Palace, and Queen Sinjeong, who adopted King Gojong, the mother of Heongjong and the son of Heungseon, became king in 1890. The restoration of Heungbok Hall is part of the second restoration project at Gyeongbok Palace, which will lead to the construction of Heungbok Jeongjeon, Bokdogak, Donggak, Mungmun and Fence next fall. The Cultural Heritage Administration is planning to establish a detailed utilization plan for Heungbokjeon Hall to provide education and experience programs. psh59@yna.co.kr.

On the veranda, the children's mothers (24) were rescued and collapsed with burns to their arms and legs. Police and fire authorities are investigating the cause of the blaze. Park Chul-hong, a reporter at Yonhap News Agency in Gwangju, died of a fire at an apartment building in Gwangju at dawn, and three children in their 20s were burned and their mothers suffered burns. She called her husband, who was drunk and divorced before the fire broke out, and said she wanted to die.Three children were reported to have died in an apartment fire at 2:28 a.m. in Seoul on July 31. A fire broke out at an apartment building in Duam-dong, Buk-gu, Gwangju, Korea Fire evolved in about 25 minutes, but in the children's room inside the apartment, a 5-year-old girl was found dead. On the veranda of an apartment, the children's mother (22) is being treated after being rescued by a second degree burnt on her arm and leg. The small room where the children were sleeping inside the apartment was destroyed and some of the kitchen and living room were burnt down. About 20 residents of nearby areas also evacuated the area. The fire was presumed to have started in the room where the three children were sleeping. Feeling the fire started, he called his ex-husband to report it.When police asked whether there was a fire, the fire broke out when I boiled ramen. According to A, she left a gas stove on to make ramen and went into the children's room to wake up and evacuate to the veranda when she realized the fire was on. However, the kitchen gas range is hardly burnt and the children's small fire is suspected of being caused by the fire, officials said. When the police asked about the cause of the fire, A did not answer them with his mouth closed, police said. A was reportedly drunk just before the fire and called her ex-husband and told him he wanted to die. According to police, A, who was found to have divorced from her husband on July 27 and had to support three children without any job.

"How much water should be applied to cool the hot sun?It may seem unlikely, and it may seem like a young child will have a question, but when the question is scientifically solved, it creates the potential to cool down the very hot heat in the sun.The journal Knowridge said, ' How much water does it take to extinguish the sun?I have posted a notice.According to the passage, the Sun is 109 times larger than the mass of the Sun's system, making up 99 percent of its mass. Because of this, it is not easy for humans to feel the size of the sun with any sense that they can feel in their bodies.▽ Solar data = The structure of the sun is composed of nuclear, radiation, and convection. The outer layer alone is 200,000 kilometers thick, or 16 Earth thickness.In this way, it is not enough to turn off the sun with water, but it is not the only difficult thing to do. Since the sun was not originally ' burning, ' it seems very sceptical to stop its activity from watering.The burning on Earth is the release of light or heat as flammable materials, such as organic material, react fiercely with oxygen. To avoid this reaction, it is effective to cut off the supply of oxygen or reduce the temperature. Water has been used as a representative tool for this in the past.Meanwhile, what is causing the sun to generate heat and light is the successive fusion of hydrogen atoms in the Sun's core. The Sun's core is at 250 billion atmospheric pressure, at a high pressure of 15 million Kelvin, and two hydrogen atoms collide, producing a strong amount of light and heat energy when they change into helium.Therefore, stopping the sun's operations to the extent that firefighters are waterproof does not really work at all.What would the effects be if water was broken down into hydrogen and oxygen? Suppose water is supplied with a mass as the sun, and by some factor water molecules are broken down into hydrogen and oxygen. As I mentioned earlier, hydrogen atoms are the fuel of the sun. Therefore, the addition of hydrogen by water supply has the opposite effect of allowing the sun to carry more fuel.Oxygen has the opposite effect, too. Oxygen is a byproduct of nuclear fusion. The Sun is now converting hydrogen into helium by using proton-proton reactions. However, there is another type of reaction called carbon (C) - nitrogen (N) - oxygen (O) cycle (CNO cycle). The CNO cycle is a process of nuclear fusion in which hydrogen is converted to helium within a star.Currently 0.8 % of solar fusion reactions take place in this way.Therefore, more oxygen in the sun can lead to more fusion reactions. CNO cycles also feature increased reaction weight as stellar masses increase. Therefore, as the mass of the Sun increases as oxygen is supplied, the CNO cycle is expected to become more active and solar activity will increase dramatically.From this theory, it is concluded that not only can the sun be wiped out with water, but it can also increase its activity.But there is one way that water may weaken the sun.It is what makes the water run into the sun at high speed. The Sun is a huge heavenly body, but it is basically a collection of gases that do not have an Earth's crust and that do mostly hydrogen. In any way, the round sun may split into two like a watermelon, when a very large amount of water can be struck with the same speed as light.This half of the mass of the Sun will collapse the hot, high-pressure environment that contributes to the creation of energy. In this case, fusion reactions may stop and solar activity may stop.That is, when there is a large volume of water capable of cutting objects into very strong streams, it is not necessarily impossible in theory to stop the activity of the Sun.Of course, when the sun goes out of action, stars in the solar system, including Earth, lose their light and heat, and become the world of death.Baek Bong-sam, Editorial Writer, (paikshow@zdnet.co.kr) According to the Bank of Korea on July 31, mortgage rates of the five major commercial banks (KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Woori, KEB, Hana and NHCF) increased by a maximum of 0.55 % over the past year.(Seoul = Yonhap news) Kim Hyun-tae : A citizen checks his loan information using an automated device at a bank branch in downtown Seoul. The bank's Mixed Mortgage Guide rate is 3.71 to 4.85 percent as of January 2 next year. Considering that the mortgage rate at National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (Nonghyup Bank) was 3.26 to 4.30 percent as of January 2, the lowest rate of interest rose 0.45p, and the highest rate of interest rose 0.55p. The bank kept the maximum rate at 2.27 percent, but raised the rate this year when its five-year rate on bonds rose from 2.03 percent to 2.58 percent. The five-year rate on bonds seems to have soared due to the Bank of Korea's expectations of higher key interest rates last month and the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) rate hike this month. As a result, the interest rate of the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation's mortgage guide went up by up to 4.91 percent on October 30. Shinhan Bank saw its housing loan guide rate rise 0.20 percent from 3.48 to 4.79 percent on Jan. 2, up from 3.48 percent a year earlier. Shinhan Bank reduced its additional rate by 2.15 % in May from 2.55 % earlier this year to 2.15 % on May 22, but raised the rate by 0.05 %. The Financial Supervisory Service put the brakes on Shinhan Bank, saying, "" The increase in the rate of the additional rate is inappropriate, "" but as of January 2 next year, the mortgage loan rate is still subject to a 2.20 % increase. Our bank's mortgage guide rate on January 2 was 3.58 to 4.58 percent, which is 0.20%p higher than this year's (3.38 to 4.38 percent). KEB Hana Bank's guide rate will be applied at 3.495 to 4.695 percent. This is a 0.166 percent rise from 3.329 to 4.549 percent a year ago, and a 0.146 percent rise from the lowest rate. Hana Bank opened the era of 5 % mortgage rates with the highest rate exceeding 5 % from October to November, but lowered the additional rate after the authorities warned them. As the rate of additional transaction deductions through favorable interest rates is increased, the lowest additional rate will be lowered from 1.120 % on July 26 to 0.920 % on July 2. KB Kookmin Bank will apply a mixed-dollar mortgage rate of 3.65 to 4.85 percent from Jan. 2-5. It gained 0.14 percent, or 0.14 percent, from last week's applied rate of 3.41 to 4.71 percent. Kookmin Bank applies mortgage rates on a weekly basis. Meanwhile, the COFIX (index of financing costs) rate, which serves as the basis rate for floating home mortgage loans, has also soared over the past year. The new supply base course has seen a sharp rise in the number of new transactions over the past year, according to the Federation of Korean Banks. Copix, the standard of new payments for November, which was announced on July 15, was 1.77 percent, and Copyx, the standard of balance, was 1.66 percent. Considering that the Copix as a New Quote was 1.51 % last November and Copyx as a Balance was 1.62 % last November, the new Copyx as a New Quick as of 0.26 % over the year. heeva@yna.co.kr"

The ministry is pushing to cut the number of generals sharply starting in the New Year as a key task of ` Defense Reform 2.0, ` a group of government officials said on July 31. Currently, the number of generals in the nation is about 430. The Defense Ministry announced Lee Myung-bak's administration, 2011 '307 military reform plan' by 2020, according to the general said that to 15 % (time of going 60) reduction of the quota. However, Park Geun-hye's administration established 'defense reform, and 2014 - 30' in 'Amendment 1,' of the plan to reduce the 40 amendments. A government official said, We plan to drastically reduce the number of generals to a core task so that people can feel the level of defense reform based on the purpose of pursuing defense reform that meets people`s expectations. The Defense Ministry also expressed its will to reduce the general officer's quota in its general promotion personnel on July 28. The colonel's promotion to brigadier general was selected to be seven seats short of its original plan.

"" The Defense Ministry has announced its intention to reduce the general staff through defense reform, which was established whenever the government changed, but has been criticized for not being properly implemented. So far, two corps, five divisions and four brigades have been disbanded as part of the military reform, but only eight more generals have been left. Three of the members of the Defense Agency were reduced according to the plan. In addition, the 1st Army headquarters (General) and the 3rd Army Command (General) will be merged next year, and when the Operations Command (General) is launched, it will be disclosed that they will not be able to eliminate the full presidency yet.

But defense civic groups claim that by 2020, the number of soldiers who can reduce the number to 500,000 is 7.6 per 10,000, which is larger than the level of five Americans who can do so.The Defense Ministry is also expected to include a slime-building troop structure to drastically reduce generals in the Defense Reform 2.0. Defense Minister Song Young-moo said in his New Year's message of 2018, Let's now strive to build a `` lion-quickening, strong military force '' with 2018 as the first year of ` Defense Reform 2.0. ` This is interpreted as his willingness to turn the current group, which is criticized as an administrative army, into a mobile force that can immediately use its combat power in the event of a slim reconciliation. It is highly likely that the rank of the chief of military units under the direct control of the Ministry of National Defense, such as the National Defense Agency and the Defense Investigation Agency, and that it boldly removes the possibility of requiring support units or consignment windows.

Regarding the Hong Kong vessel issue, China's exchange office said on July 31, "" It is not related to the country. "" Taiwan's Yonhap News Agency, when it was reported that a Taiwanese company had rented a Hong Kong ship, began a line drawing, saying, The company in question has been registered with Marshall Islands. The South China Morning Post (SCMP), a special administrative officer in Hong Kong, quoted Chinese experts as saying, "" It is difficult for the U.S. to stop smuggling to North Korea, just as it can not stop smuggling drugs. "" It is also noted that China, Taiwan and Hong Kong responded through local media outlets, not from the government's point of view. The move is intended to avoid sanctions as U.S. satellites caught a leak of oil products to a North Korean vessel in international waters, violating U.N. Security Council's resolution to impose sanctions on the North. China's People's Daily, China`s Communist Party branch, said Hong Kong-registered Light-House Winmore shipped petroleum products to North Korean vessels in the West Sea, the company said, citing a government announcement. Taiwan's State Agency for Defense Agency also reported that the crew of the ship did this under orders from a Taiwanese company, but Taiwan authorities denied the incident. China has nothing to do with the incident, so it has turned its head to Taiwan. China has denied any evidence of a Chinese vessel being a Chinese vessel or a North Korean vessel being smuggled to the waters disclosed by the U.S. Treasury, and has been seen as an act of innocence following ' House of Lords ' on Taiwan. Actual subject of a fuel smuggling to North Korea is confirmed as Taiwan, China is Donald Trump the president's China some level about the pressure defense is possible. With the flame on Taiwan's foot, Taiwan is keen to distance itself from the Villians Burger Group, the company that has rented the Hong Kong vessel. The Korean government said it hired the ship by the Taiwan Billans bunker group, but the company is registered with Marshall Islands, adding, "" Currently, external divisions and national security agencies in Taiwan are investigating Taiwan. "" It can be seen as an attempt to draw the line, stressing that although the company is a Taiwanese company, its registration is on Marshall Islands. The South China Morning Post (SCMP), a well-known media outlet for the Wright House Winmore Line, started defending the North in a rather perverse manner, comparing smuggling to drug control. Citing Chinese experts, SCMP said, "" Smuggling is a very difficult task to eradicate, a task that governments everywhere have, "" adding, "" Even the U.S. government can't crack down on illegal drugs across borders in Mexico.

"▽ Work on battery for wearables (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) = New Year's calendar, and colored paper used by children to fold paper, are common materials in everyday life. Scientists are currently conducting research to focus on the new uses of these paper. Shim Woo-young and Lee Tae-yoon, a Yonsei University professor, translated "" Pressure Sensors "" into paper. The sensor is sensitive enough to distinguish the weight of a grain of rice (8mm). The researchers noted that the surface of the paper had fine curves. Because of its curvature, when two sheets of paper overlap, they do not completely adhere to each other.The paper pressure sensor (top) and the keyboard [provided by the Korea Research Foundation] were applied with conductive material between the paper and made the sensor using two sheets. Usually, the sensors do not have current flow, but when applied, two sheets of paper will catch on and run through them. The researchers also created keyboards with the sensors. Depending on the intensity of the touch, you can also type in lowercase and uppercase letters separately. Professor Shim Woo-young explained, "" I wanted to convey a message that if I understood the material properties well, I could make as many elements as silicon. "" The results of the study were published in the international journal Small last month. Patch-type sensors, which measure blood sugar, were also made of paper. Choi Seok-hyun, an electronics professor at New York University in the United States, and his team produced these sensors last October by thinning enzyme fuel cells. Inside the Enzymes Fuel Cell, made by Choi's team, is a glucose oxidase, which dissolves glucose. When glucose enters a cell, it reacts with the glucose oxidase and generates an electrical current.Images of patch-type sensors measuring their mass in sweat. Since more sugar per sweat generates more electricity, current values indicate the content per sweat. It is also possible to estimate blood sugar based on the sugar content in sweat. The researchers also confirmed that two real people could be measured per sweat. Professor Choi Seok-hyun said, Since the sensor is made of paper, even if it is commercialized, it is cheaper and could be used anywhere in the developing world.In patch-type sensors, the higher the amount of glucose in sweat, the higher the current value. The current value of the current flow indicates the amount of glucose in the sweat. Some studies have focused on the nature of paper that's flexible and light. These characteristics are appropriate for "" batteries "" for wearable devices. Lee Sang-young, professor of energy and chemical engineering at the Ulsan Research Institute (UNIST), developed ink to print batteries on plain paper last year. Print out the pattern with the ink in the area of one centimeter on the paper with a thickness of 10 to 20 ㎛ (micrometer · one microsecond), and then turn on the LED light bulb for a few seconds. If the ink is commercialized, it would allow you to print ' batteries ' from your home using an inkjet printer. Paper is an environmentally friendly resource, and we expect it to perform well as an electrical material with flexibility and a unique pore structure, said Professor Lee Sang-young.An inkjet printer's battery on paper.

We will elevate our founding principles to embrace rational progress and reform and turn it into a unified party for the young and the people, the statement said. The right party and the unified party to lead also presented a blueprint of expanding the party's foundations to the whole country and ensuring the reform of the party is uniformly supported by men, women and children. Ahn, who has chosen Bongsangaedo Woosugagyo as the reform leader of the party, said he would take the ` Bongsando Woosugabyo `, which means that if he meets the mountain again in the New Year's idiom, he will not be able to do so.

Based on these figures, the opponents had said, "" The merger should be decided at a national convention, and the result was too humble for us to get a result of the vote based on the number of votes we received from the GNP Chairman Ahn's confidence in. ""In particular, the vote, which failed to meet the minimum turnout of one-third as set out in the party constitution, was an objection to the merger with the right political parties and was an apparent sign of distrust of Ahn immediately.They cited the fact that former Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon had to resign immediately after voting only 25.7 percent of the votes for the free school lunch program.Opponents reaffirmed their opposition to the merger, saying, The party should not seek to unite to the conservative right, while making it clear that the right party is different from the public.Opponents have launched the National Center for the Protection of the People's Party to protect the party by stopping the promotion of a conservative coalition and excluding Ahn. Eighteen lawmakers were named as of now - Park Ji-won, Yoo Seong-hyeop, Chung Dong-young, Chun Jung-bae and Choi Kyung-hwan.Opponents of the merger made it clear that they would stop the coalition by saying the National Assembly from running smoothly to integrate with the right party. ◇ Right political party Let's move to the discussion table right now, a group of supporters from the Korea Party welcomed the referendum on the merger, and immediately unified the unified discussion body, calling it what was expected.Two parties, each the party of the people, have officially joined the existing "" 2+2 negotiation table "" and the committee's planning committee (the Unification Promotion Board) followed by its own roadmap.Ha Tae-kyung, the supreme council member, said, "" We should organize an integrated committee that expanded the 2+2 consultative body in early January.

"One out of five subway stations has gone out of business not to earn money … and citizens pick bread at a bakery in the Seoul Subway Line No. 2-7 early December 29. (Not relevant to the article in question) / reporter Ryu In-ha on her way to work. The first thing that busy office workers smell when they enter subway history is baking. When you smell bread baked in the oven, you turn your head to bakery. On Dec. 29, three to four office workers lined up to buy bread and coffee at a bakery in Seoul Subway Line No. 2, Underground Subway Station. They order one or two relatively simple types of bread and coffee to eat, including bagels, muffins, and mini bread. It is also cheap. Prices vary according to the type, but the price of each bread starts at 1000 won and does not exceed 2,500 won. Coffee is also sold much cheaper than franchise coffee chains. You can buy a cup of americano for 1500 to 1900 won. Some stores even have a 1000 won discount on americano bread. A bakery worker at Sadang Station on the way to Seoul said, "" We usually have a rush hour for customers between 7:30 a.m. and 8:00 a.m., "" adding, "" Our neighbors bought bread and coffee on their way to work. "" As people in the region with a large floating population, five to six people wait in line once. It is also the beginning of lunch time. Some locals or elderly people with no room to spare buy bread and eat it for a little while. The man at the bakery said, "" The majority of the time, the elderly bring us a lot of bread at lunchtime. "" Sausages or Soboroux bread is available at 1,000 won per head.Bakers like this have mushroomed in subway history in the last few years. Those who dreamed of becoming president of the chicken restaurant after retirement are now becoming presidents of bakeries. For about 150 to 200 million won in capital, a bakery in subway history can be sold and operated within 10 pyeong. According to the "" Store Management Status of Subway Line No. 1-8 "" provided by the Seoul Transportation Corporation, 264 (18.1 %) out of 1,458 stores were sold in Seoul excluding their lawsuits or construction projects. There are 4 to 6 bakeries in the stations of Jamsil Station on Line 2, Yeonsinnae Station on Line 3, Hapjeong Station on Line 6, Hak-dong and Nonhyeon Station on Line 7. Already, the bakeries in subways are overcrowded. Some bakeries across the history are held to ' awkward cohabitation '. However, there is no legal device to stop a bakery from flocking to the area of history. The Fair Trade Commission set a limit of 250 meters between the stores based on best practices in 2012, but was abolished in 2015 due to lack of emphasis and lack of practicality. The "" Member Business Act "" was enforced in earnest since October 2017, but there is no restriction on the distance between the stores under the pertinent Act. Article 4 of the Act stipulates that the member body shall establish its own store or its affiliates under the same field of business as the merchant's service area without good reason. However, the affiliates concerned shall establish their own businesses within the merchant's business areas. We can`t prevent the same type of stores from entering the same store in one place at the moment, an official at the Fair Trade Commission explained.Under these circumstances, more people are starting businesses without any profit, even if they are not get-rich-quick, and leaving their businesses in vain. The bakery owner, who requested anonymity, said, "" We found that the employees at the branch office could not sell their employees, and we could never get at least five million won in net profit. "" But he started his own business with 1.5 million won per month. The bakery, which was visited at 10:00 a.m. on December 28, had no customers for about 40 minutes, even though it was past its regular time. Of course, there are some businesses that are doing well, but when the headquarters first describes it, it seems as if they are blowing away all of the sales and net profits. It is also a structure that only distributes parts of the headquarters. In reality, the president spent 100 million won on bakery except for the money he paid at the affiliated headquarters and the deposit he received in the future. The electricity and supply facilities, not to mention facilities provided by the headquarters, should be paid for by the affiliated companies, he said.As a result of reporting by the [Day Trend > Weekly Trend], the two companies that recruit merchant stores in subway history called, they took the subscription fee of 20 million won or more from the affiliated businesses and received the nominal equipment. An official at the headquarters explained, We have to pay about 21 million won, including 5 million won in guarantees to headquarters, 5 million won to join, 5 million to provide education, and 5.5 million won to outsource the interior facilities. This is the money that the bakery can not get back even if it quits early. Even if the store is located in the subway history, the franchise is required to pay 42 percent of its sales price for its homemade bread and quarter-baked bread twice a month. Still, Paris Bagette or Dunkin Donuts is required to pay 50-55 percent of its sales to its headquarters, but we are not cheap, explained an official at the agency. A net profit was made from 58 % of total sales, and from monthly rent to employees ' salaries and monthly rent to Seoul Transportation Corporation, municipal tax, and electricity tax, all of which were given to bakery owners. The Seoul Transportation Authority makes a monthly bid notice and asks for a store owner. Store rental costs from 1 million won to 20 million won, depending on the floating population and size of stores. Net profit other than fixed costs is also a mere "" forecast "" of the affiliated business. "" If you look on the Internet, you will find a lot of people who need to run a subway bakery for about a year and then look for someone to succeed you, "" the president of the bakery said. "" It's not as if I had to withdraw my case. "" The Seoul Transportation Corporation, which gave stores to businesses operating in the same industry, is also not free from blame. In a telephone conversation with the Seoul Transportation Authority on July 29 < Day Trend >, "" If you want to keep other bread companies from entering, you will have to comply with construction internal regulations or with the Store Lease Protection Act, but that's not the only reason why you can enforce such regulations now. "" However, we will try to improve the store status by publishing it in detail to avoid franchise operators who suffer losses due to predictions made by the affiliated companies, said Kang.Kim Tae-hoon, director of the joint council's National Security Council, said, "" If the convenience store provides itself with a profit that can not be trusted by the business owners, say, ' How much less than the estimated sales figures at the time of the franchise headquarters? ', they supplement their own profits.< Reporterships acha@kyunghyang.com> ▶ Popularity newspaper [Twitter] [Facebook] < Popular free comic strips] 1.1.1.

"After the investigation, the Prince-Chinese Department and the Uncontradictory Department of Internal Affairs and Internal Affairs Ministry distributed the missing daughter to her colleagues, and the investigation revealed her body as a ` fake attitude `, Jeong Gi-hee (Yonhap news agency) She went to the police station with her aunt (35, female) to cry, "" Please find your daughter "" and to distribute missing leaflets to her co-workers, police said. According to Jeonju Deokjin Police Station on July 31, the two women visited a neighborhood zone near their home on July 8 and said, Our daughter disappeared last month. Please visit. Police in the scene recalled that they had shown their full consideration of the children who were missing. Ko's father had a sad look on her face, and Lee, an insider, explained how she disappeared. Koh was also said to have yelled, ' You can't live without your daughter. ' For quite some time, she would have loved to have died without her. They remained falsely even after the police issued the missing persons warning on July 15. Her father Ko told employees at a nearby plant that they lost their daughter. If you see a similar child, tell him or her.Koh and Yi remained cool when police investigating Ko Joon-hee's body, who is being transported from the hill, headed for their family. I lost my daughter, Goh said, The police are questioning me for not telling them what happened to the missing child. Or are you a suspect? Lee also said, Why are you investigating like this? Do not ask such a question, the official was quoted as saying by a negative reaction. When police asked for lie detectors and hypnosis to find out why Miss Jun-hee went missing, they refused, saying, I won't take such checks. It is known that when police conducted a search for houses and vehicles on July 22, Koh looked at them without any serious agitation or guilt. Police wasted no time and manpower by sending 3,000 people to search because of the pro-communist ministry and the unmarried woman who had consistently acted uncomplainininingly in the investigation. "" Parents who lost their children usually cooperated actively with police investigations, but when Goh asked why she went missing, she responded with a very sensitive response. "" The court accused the pro-parential Ko and Lee`s mother Kim, who allegedly mistreated the body the day before, of destruction of evidence and possible conduct by prosecution. Police also requested an arrest warrant for Lee, a woman who was an internal engineer, on charges of colluding with Goh to dump her body. Whether to detain Lee will be decided after questioning suspects before the arrest warrant (physical examination) held at Jeonju District Court at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. jaya@yna.co.kr The government is planning to make the virtual account real name by gradually preventing existing customers from using the virtual account while immediately discontinuing the new virtual account. The first step is to ensure that commercial banks can no longer issue new virtual accounts to virtual currency traders (exchanges). Virtual account is a corporate account whose large amount of collection and transfer is required from the bank to identify individual customer transactions. There is no real name verification procedure as the issuing and managing of individual virtual accounts is carried out by businesses, not banks. A ban on new virtual account issuance results in the effect that the newly launched virtual currency dealers can no longer operate using virtual accounts. They have to operate under a real-name account. Existing virtual currency dealers are also prohibited from providing virtual accounts for new members.Speaking at a virtual currency market check meeting on Dec. 28, the former vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission, Kim Yong-beom, will have only the existing virtual currency transaction company issued, which gradually requires confirmation of its real name. The real-name bank service provided during the August 28 resolution allows dealers to pay in the same bank accounts as the dealers ' real names and virtual currency dealers. If the account of the trader and the virtual currency handler are not the same bank account, one or the other must open a new account at that bank. This process has the natural effect of allowing teenagers and foreigners living abroad to be forced out of the virtual currency market. First of all, teenagers and non-residential foreigners find it difficult to open new accounts at banks. The measures to prevent voice phishing are very strict in determining the opening of accounts for teenagers and non-residential foreigners. In addition, the same bank could check the resident registration number of the users, which would make it easier for banks to enforce a ban on transactions between non-residential foreigners and teenagers imposed on December 13, 2006. However, in case of adults with normal economic activities, they can continue to deal with virtual currency with existing virtual accounts without being subjected to sanctions unless they deposit more new money. Financial authorities say the transparency of financial transactions involving virtual currency would be enhanced if the bank can approve the transactions between the identified dealers ` accounts and the virtual currency handlers accounts. speed@yna.co.krPolice in Jeonju said on July 31, "" As a result of the first autopsy, it was impossible to say that Jun-hee was not killed by external shock, including abuse, due to corruption. ""Guksu has broken several bones behind her torso, including her ribs, according to police.Considering that the rib bones of young children are highly elastic and do not break easily, it is more likely that they will be killed by external strikes. Guksu was also quoted as saying, ' Especially if you break a rib on the back of your torso, you can suspect external shock damage. 'She was quoted as saying by a 36-year-old mother of an insider in Inhu-dong, Jeonju, in a statement on April 26, when she was about to take her to the hospital because she was unwell. In a CBS Nocut news report, Ko later said she attempted to cardiopulmonary resuscitation Miss Jun-hee before taking her to Jeonju.But Gukso was quoted as telling police, ' I don't think the location of the bone break indicates any low or even no damage caused by CPR. '"" We are currently investigating various possibilities, including murder or natural causes, and we do not know whether the information delivered by the head of the national treasure trove of information has yet to be confirmed, "" a police official said."
"Park Cheol-hong, a reporter of the Seoul Central News Agency, said, "" We can't trust the testimony of the police because of the abnormal behavior of my drunk mother before and after 15 months of shooting an apartment fire, my daughter and her daughter died. There is a growing consensus that the actions of the mother who left her three siblings home drunk and her father who was playing in the PC room were completely incomprehensible.When police in northern Gwangju saw the cause of the fire on July 31, they said, "" My mother rubbed a blanket into a cigarette in a fire in an apartment building where 4, 2, 15, and three months old were killed. "" However, police can not suspect arson despite specific statements from his biological mother, suggesting a possible misfiring. Shortly after the fire, he ran to the veranda to call his husband, instead of first taking steps to save his young son and daughter. Police said they even said they did abnormal behavior by covering up their beddings to sleeping children. Mr. A also said, "" I tried to save the children and put out the fire, "" but it was not confirmed whether it was really so. It is also a suspicious place to declare ' I turned on the fire to make ramen ' at the beginning of the incident and then reverse the statement that ' I was drunk and did not remember well. ' Text messages and phone calls to her husband that hinted at her suicide before the fire were set off by suspicion of arson. After the fire, he tried talking to his husband who was out of the house several times. Police say they made nine calls or tried to call seven times before the fire broke out, one time after being rescued from the veranda, and another time immediately after the fire broke out. In particular, Mr. A also spoke to her husband on the phone three times : ' I will disappear from the world. And I will die. ' According to the police, her husband's statement that she would die frequently in the process of filing for divorce, and she argued over how to raise her children.The abnormal behavior of three children killed in an apartment fire [Yonhap news agency] is interpreted as being drunk. The night before the fire, at 7:40 p.m. on July 30, she left home with her husband and her three siblings to drink with an acquaintance. A drunk with nine soju sang as much as 4,000 won in a coin karaoke room, and then staggered home in a taxi. Her husband, 21, reportedly went to PC room about two hours after his wife left home, leaving her three children unattended. According to the statement, he finally came home drunk, rubbed a cigarette in the blanket, and hugged his 15-month-old daughter who was asleep before waking up. Even if the accidental fire turns out to be not arson, it is likely that it will be a problem for parents to leave their children under the age of 4 at home. Police will review whether the suspicion of arson or accidental homicide can be applied instead of simple true story. Some of the family members of A and B say, I have "" taken the young children to the dogs because of their parents ' actions, "" and also say, "" The police should investigate them thoroughly to comfort the young married people. "" At 2:26 a.m. on July 31, a family of four - two years old and a daughter were burned down in an 11-story apartment in Duam-dong, Buk-gu, Gwangju when they were in a fire and their mother died in a rescue by a 15-month-old veranda and her mother.Three Children Live in an Apartment Fire Station.Police have received reports from a house in Wachita, Kansas that a young man shot dead his father and took the rest of his family hostage.Police on the scene shot dead a young man hanging around the house, and it turned out to be a false report and that the young man had done nothing wrong.Police released a hoax call recording at a news conference to determine what happened : the caller was a gunman and acted as if he were turning himself in.Police caught 25-year-old suspect Tyler Barris in Los Angeles for a hoax call, and said Berris made a hoax call out of spite when he got into a minor argument playing online.Kim Ki-bong [kgb@ytn.co.kr]"
