The bereaved family said, "" The deceased died at a university hospital in London on July 4 while suffering from chronic lung disease. "" The killer is the party to the Frapumo scandal in 1963, which forced Prime Minister Harold McMillan to resign as head of the conservative Cabinet. Defense Minister John Prapurmo, who was married in 1961, had a sexual relationship for several weeks after meeting with then 19-year-old model and call girl killer at a party. Their relationship was morally reprehensible but there was nothing wrong with it publicly. However, when another lover was found to be Eugene Ivanov, a naval attaché to the Soviet Embassy, during the same time of the killer in late 1962, the scandal was raised to a national security incident. It was more controversial when the Cold War was at its height, and suspicions arose that the killer might be a spy. When a Labour lawmaker raised suspicions about his scandal over national security in March 1963, Prufumo denied entirely his relationship with the killer, saying it was not inappropriate. He then resigned for lying, and the MacMillan conservative government lost in the October elections. "" She had to pay so much for her personal sacrifice, "" said Simur Platt, the son of the killer. From then on, they lived in Nakseonjae, Changdeokgung. The death of the last king of the Joseon Dynasty, Sejabin, was the last to be resolved. Even the news of his death was revealed on July 5, 10 days later. Julia Lee, the wife of Yi Un, the late father of the late Prince of Korea, died of old age at Halliny's Hospital in Hawaii on July 26. Ninety-four Former Seoul National University professor Lee Nam-ju (78), who took Julia Lee`s death, said, "" I could not even use my hand to move, so I lay down and closed my eyes dismally. "" Professor Lee is the niece of his uncle Lee Gu. After her divorce, Julia did not return to her original adult ' Julia Mullock ' and remained ' Julia Lee ' all her life. Julia Lee is a German American who met with Yi Gu in New York, USA in the late 1950s. Julia, who was responsible for interior design at the design office of Chinese-American architect Io Ming Pei, found a unique Oriental young man among her colleagues. Yi Gu, an architect who graduated from MIT, fascinated Julia with her sensitive and attentive personality, and 27-year-old Yi Gu and 35-year-old Julia got married in 58. Professor Lee Nam-joo explained, I think Julia, who is eight years older than me, would have been able to give up her mind as if she were my mother or older sister while floating alone in another country. The photo was taken at the Nakseonjae of Changdeokgung, where the last Imperial descendants of the Korean Empire, Yi Gu, Julia Lee and her husband lived in the 1970s. Julia left for Hawaii in 1995 after she stayed in Korea even after divorcing in 82 years. At the request of King Youngchin and his wife Lee Bang-ja who stayed in Japan in 63, they returned to Korea together and unpacked at Nakseonjae in Changdeokgung Palace in Seoul. Though Julia was talented and warm-hearted, she could not stand the sight of her strange palace friends and relatives. The clan, which was unable to recognize the blue-eyed foreigner, urged Yi Gu to divorce on the grounds that it could not succeed her father. Julia, who was separated from her husband who was staying at a hotel because she hated Nakseonjae, eventually signed her divorce papers in 82. The features of the days of Nakseonjae and Nakseonjae. From left, Yi Gu, Empress Sunjeong, Mrs. Lee and Julia Lee. Professor Lee Nam-ju said, "" Although I had a feud with my mother-in-law, I set up a sewing room on Nakseonjae and hired disabled women from the social welfare corporation, Myeonghuiwon, to conduct training for the royal court. "" The disabled, who learned from him, followed Julia by calling her "" the big mother, "" and were meant to be the first to stay in the welfare business after her divorce, running a dressing room called Julia Shop.

Julia Lee Eun-sook (played by Lee Eun-sook), who adopted Julia when she was Nakseonjae, was absent. Professor Lee said that she missed her ex-husband Lee Gu, who had never been heard of since she went to Japan again. Returning home for the time of September 2000, Julia stayed for a month and looked around the place of memories. After paying a visit to the grave of her father-in-law, King Youngchin, she visited Nakseonjae, where she used to live as the mistress of her house, and met her disabled students. He donated some 450 pictures of royal relics and modern Korean history that would have been given to Yi Gu to the Deoksugung National Museum of Modern History, during which a documentary was shown under the title of ' Julia's Last Letter '. After the divorce, the reunion with Yi Gu was not realized. Not invited to the funeral, Julia saw the funeral procession from afar. After the funeral, he bowed down in front of Yi Gu's grave alone.[Central Photo] The reunion with her former husband, who had hoped to see her again, never came to pass. The remains of Yi Gu, who was found dead on July 16, 2005 at the old Akasaka Prince Hotel in Tokyo, Japan, were found to have been buried in Korea on July 20, but Julia was not invited to the funeral.

"The Supreme Court has already decided to hold Samsung Group's Seoul District Court to investigate the truth. Song Jin-won, a reporter at Yonhap News Agency, said, "" Choi Soon-sil, who did not actively cooperate with prosecutors and special prosecutors for state affairs to avoid punishment, received the nickname, ' Special prosecution aide ' at mon@yna.co.kr( The Seoul Central District Court's criminal agreement, part 22 (Judge Kim Se-yoon), acknowledged Jang's accusations as guilty and sentenced her to two and a half years in jail and arrested her. This is the punishment level that is one year longer than the one-and-a-half months the prosecution has sentenced Jang to. Chang was put on trial last year, but was released early this June due to the expiration of the arrest deadline, but was put back in jail on the same day. Chang confessed what he knew during the prosecution and special prosecutors ' investigation and cooperated to earned him the nickname of helper. Catalyst of a bribery investigation over the Samsung Group, the president and Choi Chang is also submitted to the special prosecutor a 'The second tablet'. Chang's testimony was also crucial when he was found guilty of involvement by Choi in the official development assistance project in Myanmar. That is why Jang, the nephew of Choe and an accomplice in various privileges, helped the independent counsel`s identity and won the favorable impression.Choi Soon-sil, a reporter at the Seoul Central Sports Center, is accused of pressuring Samsung Group to pay for the trial. During the state court trial that was held in Korea for nearly two decades, she was seen as a witness in various places to explain what she knew and helped verify the truth. However, Jang's efforts have not taken the weight off his guilt. The prosecution and the prosecution have suggested a form of English law that does not allow it, but they also provided a form of punishment for the crime investigation co-operations, and a form of punishment for those who reprimand or reprimand. The court judged that Chang actually operated the center. He also pointed out that even though the center was established to seek Choi's private interests in the long run, Chang was the one who benefited most from the crime. The prosecution is very guilty of the crime, taking into consideration that the accused actively cooperated with the truth, such as making sincere statements to the state investigation or trial, the court said in a statement. I have a chance to say something and say to her, I am currently with my baby. Where would I run without anyone to look after the child? I asked to avoid arrest, taking into consideration the cooperation I have provided with the prosecution and my sincere involvement in the trial. "" There was also the last time Yura was in town, and it was good to leave her alone ... she moved to a new school last Monday. Actually, I don`t know what to say now because I have white hair. But the judge went ahead with the arrest, saying, We have already reached an agreement with the court. After finding that the results were not likely to change, Jang wrote something down on a piece of paper and handed it over to her lawyer. Some analyze that he wrote down the school address of an acquaintance or child who informed them of his confinement.

Have a good day, my dear friend Minho, looking forward to seeing you in a world that is no longer sad or cold.I will love and remember.The funeral service was held at Seoguipo Industrial Science High School, Lee's alma mater, on the morning of July 6, 18, after he died in an accident during an on-site practice session.If there was no accident, I would have carried my bags to school laughing and talking about the game I played yesterday. On this morning, Lee went to school by riding in a cold coffin in a car.Lee's friends and dozens of seniors and juniors bowed in condolences for the vehicles entering the school from both sides.When Un-gucha arrived at the school gym for the funeral ceremony, her brother carried a portrait of her brother in front of her, and her friends operated the coffin behind her.The funeral service was attended by funerals, including superintendent Lee Seok-moon, Jeju Province Governor Won Hee-ryong, school teachers, friends, seniors, and civic groups, to pray for the souls of the dead.Family members cry during the funeral of Lee Min-ho at Seogwipo Industry Science High School in Jeju yesterday. Lee lost his life when he was caught in a field practice session at a beverage plant in Jeju City on Nov. 19.Reporters of News 1 and Lee Seok-hyung were distressed to think of Lee, who passed away too early and did not have a 20 year old flower to bloom.Lee's father and mother, who were known to have been extremely filial, wept and mourned over the incredible reality during the ceremony.Lee Seok-moon, the superintendent of education, said in an investigation, "" Adults ' twisted desires and selfishness have delivered the end of a rosy life, "" adding, "" Adults's remorse was weighed down by the heavy iron without blood and tears. """" The sacrifice of Minho once again served as a reminder of the safe educational environment, "" Won said in a condolence speech. `` Making sure the incident does not recur is the only way to comfort her. We will do our best as we can remain.Kim Yeo-seon, co-president of the Jeju Regional Countermeasure Committee, said, I have no interest in working hard at all in companies, schools or the government. We were too complacent and killed people. We should see the field exercise that led to Lee`s death from scratch again.After the ceremony, the bereaved family looked around the classroom of the first class of the third grade where Lee spent his school days.The body of Yi will be cremated at Yangji Park in Cheju and buried in the natural burial ground of HanullurI Park.Lee was caught in a factory for beverage maker Jay Creation in Handong-ri, Gujwa-eup, Jeju at around 1:50 p.m. on July 9 when he was caught in an accident.After the tragic incident, voices were raised criticizing the problem of managing trainees at the companies and education authorities and the field exercise system.As the controversy grew, the Education Ministry announced that it would scrap field practice in the form of early job opportunities.Police are investigating three business leaders on charges of professional negligence resulting from death, and the bereaved family and civic groups accuse them of violating the Labor Standards Law.Separately from the police, the Ministry of Employment and Labor began supervising the company`s special work on July 27.The Ministry of Environment posted an unusual bid late last month. The plan is to purchase 50 copper cows and five deer on the continent for 50 million won and 200 million won, respectively. Copper cattle is required to be brought in within 10 months from the date of contract and deer live on the continent.■ The Environment Ministry has a reason to bid on the purchase. The government is set to build a national endangered species recovery center in Daecheon-ri, Yeongyang-eup, Yeongyang-gun, Gyeongbuk Province, Korea, Korea, Korea, with an area of 25.5 million ㎡. It is to restore endangered species of the Korean Peninsula, which is not well studied by the private sector due to its long time and high cost. The restoration center will open next year. The Ministry of Environment chose Guri, a deer, a golden frog, and a wind egg as its plants and animals to restore their livestock for five years starting next year. However, the problem was securing the objects needed for restoration. The restoration team secured the gold frogs and the eggs themselves, but the cattle dung beetles and the continental deer couldn't find anyone to turn themselves into mothers. Both were originally common species in Korea, but are now almost extinct. Continental deer live only in Russia, China, and North Korea, and the copper bath is found in Mongolia. The bid is to find animal dealers who will be buying the animals from abroad.The import of species involves complicated procedures. The team had two and a half years of talks with Russia to get five continental deer. 200 million won for deer on the continent is the cost of visiting Russia and safely bringing back the already negotiated deer on the continent. As we had to fly our own planes and pass various quarantine inspections to bring in deer, we estimated the total cost to be around 200 million won, said an official of the group.Cervus deer. Unlike the www.biolib.cz picture, the winning contractor must go to Mongolia and pick up the dung beetles himself. However, it is not possible for tourists to collect and bring copper from cattle dung. The Mongol Government shall give permission to collect and remove such materials, and the Korean government shall pass inspection. If the products are brought in without the quarantine authority's permission, they will all be disposed of and fined. Only professional traders who are allowed to get license to import gold products under conditions that quarantine authorities offer, said an official at the ministry, referring to the possibility of bidding for deer in the continent and cattle dung. Even if they have been imported to meet various conditions, there is an acid that should be exceeded. After the deer of the continent and the copper cattle of the cattle dung are handed over to the propulsion team, the promised money must remain alive for more than a month.Since the dung of cattle dung has disappeared, the copper dung of cattle dung rolls around on its hind legs like a ball, making it a familiar bug for Koreans. But why did it have to be hard for the government to find enough to purchase such a large amount? The reason for their extinction is from the native cattle dung. Jeju National Museum of Folk and Natural History Jeong Se-ho said, "" In the late 1970s, cattle were raised with feed and antibiotics, and copper dung from cattle that ate antibiotics died. "" Kim Jin-il, an honorary professor at Sungshin Women's University, spent a decade searching all over South Korea for the copper from cattle dung. Among the cattle dung beetles and insects, the king's cow dung beetles disappeared and the copper bole in the water disappeared, leaving it hard to find any long tassels. They need a ' good cow dung ' to be restored. The restoration center is to contract with a local ranch and keep the cattle dung supplied from the pasture in the refrigerator.Continental deer, also called colour-shaped deer, were also called ‘ maehwarok ’ during the Joseon Dynasty because of their flower-like spots on their bodies. Foreign-in-one deer raised at a farm in YosaI are imported from Japan or Taiwan, and are different from the indigenous species on the Korean Peninsula that the Ministry of Environment intends to revive. The government is seeking the Korean Peninsula's continental deer.Cho Young-seok, researcher at the National Institute of Biological Resources, said, "" Deer don't disappear very well unless they are deliberately caught and killed. "" "" Japan designates the deer as the largest human pest, without any reason, and has killed them all. "" Japanese occupation in dogs and even livestock like cattle carcasses for leather as war materiel. Deer seem to have been sacrificed for the same reason. Another reason is that after liberation, they went through the Korean War and the Korean War, and hunted indiscriminately.< Correspondent Song Yoon-kyung kyung@kyunghyang.com> ▶ Popularity newspaper [Twitter] [View popular free cartoons] ■ Kyunghyang newspaper (www.khan.co.kr), Propose and redeploy illegally"
"▽ Korea International Trade Association poll .... 63 percent of Chinese respondents said, "" Buy Korean products if the THAAD solution is resolved, "" and eight out of 10 Chinese consumers said they felt that the THAAD conflict was negatively influenced by Korean products. According to a recent survey conducted by the Korea International Trade Institute on 1,000 consumers in China's top 10 cities, 899 percent of the respondents answered that the negative image of the THAAD system was found to be Korean. However, 63.1 percent of the 450 respondents who did not buy Korean products due to the THAAD conflict said they would buy Korean products again when the related issues were resolved. Although the relationship between the two countries is expected to normalize quickly, it will take some time for Korean products to restore consumer confidence, the trade association forecast. According to the survey, respondents who travel in Korea or experience Hallyu had a positive image of Korean products. 83.3 percent of the respondents who experienced traveling to Korea said they had a positive image for Korean products. Only 27.4 percent of the respondents who had no experience with Korean travel gave a positive assessment of Korean products. In the survey, 87.1 percent of the respondents said they have ever purchased Korean products. Beauty (71.1 percent) was the most expensive item to purchase, followed by food drinks (61.9 percent) and fashion (57.1 percent). Among Korean products, the most satisfactory item was a large home appliance maker with a score of 4.25 out of five. However, since the survey was conducted on October 19-30, the mood has not been fully reflected since the two countries agreed to improve relations on October 31. The Korea International Trade Association (KITA) advised that for Korean consumer goods to regain their local market status, they should break away from marketing entirely dependent on the Korean wave and make inroads into the market with products tailored to local youth trends. We need to develop management activities that fit the local system, and be fully prepared in areas such as customs clearance, labor and others, and seek to differentiate our products through local inspections, the association said.

As the work decreased next year due to sluggish orders last year, the sluggish performance will continue for the time being. According to F & Guide, a financial information provider, securities firms predicted that Samsung Heavy Industries will make sales of 8.5 trillion won and operating profit of 88.4 billion won as of yesterday.This means that the sales of Samsung Heavy Industries and Construction are not in line with predictions of sales of 7.9 trillion won and losses of 490 billion won this year, which were announced on the same day. As we planned our business next year, we conducted a cost check this year and we saw an improvement in our earnings outlook, said an official at Samsung Heavy Industries Co., explaining the expectation that global oil prices would rise earlier in the market and that things would recover.The main causes of the operating losses analyzed by the Company were increased fixed costs due to failure to adjust the Δ structure and to achieve the cost reduction goals, and the estimated cost adjustment of future costs of steel (KRW 280 billion) for some of the construction contracts received this year (USD 110 billion).The official said, "" The biggest reason why we increased our fixed costs as sales fell is that we increased our losses due to our sales, "" but added, "" We should have announced our provisional results in January next year, but that's when we first met. ""Samsung Heavy Industries is also not expected to perform very well next year. The company expects total sales to reach 5.1 trillion won and losses to be 240 billion won next year. It is expected that sales will fall 2.8 trillion won from this year`s forecast.A decline in sales is due to sluggish orders. Samsung Heavy Industries and Construction posted orders of $ 500 million last year, 10 percent of its target of $ 5.3 billion, due to deteriorating global shipbuilding market.

"[Employment ministry is not guaranteed to pay an additional 60 billion won per year for direct employment of workers.] On July 4, Paris Baguette did not accept a request to directly hire a baker to extend the deadline.We will investigate and impose fines on company officials who were found to have engaged in illegal dispatch of information to Korea, the ministry said in a briefing at the government Sejong Building. The company is set to investigate whether Vagette set up a trilateral joint venture with its partners and other private consultancies to hire bakers on July 1.SPC Group, which operates Paris Baguette, was also in a tense atmosphere throughout the day. Group leaders have been meeting since morning to closely watch the ministry's move, but no decision has been made on whether to hire them. As a result, the private sector and the SPC group are required to engage in a legal battle.Paris Baguette is in a quandary. Regarding the abrupt controversy over the illegal dispatch, the ministry launched a fact-finding survey last September and ordered the government to directly hire all bakers to operate their operations by Dec. 5. In order to do so, we need to hire more bakers over the head office's quota (5,500) at one time. The number of employees is doubling in the near future. Annual labor costs are expected to increase by about 60 billion won. If they do not hire bakers themselves, they will have to pay a penalty of 10 million won per person.Paris Baguette headquarters is not the only one on fire. If bakers are hired personally, the 11 partners will have to close their businesses overnight. The management burden of around 3400 owners of affiliates is also likely to grow. In fact, more than 1000 shop owners recently said, "" Working with a baker hired directly by the head office is like being supervised, "" adding, "" I will make my own statement instead. ""Bakers are concerned about job insecurity. That is why it can be difficult to keep guaranteed jobs as a baker if directly employed. There are also concerns that regular workers may not be guaranteed even when hired by the Paris Baguette headquarters. Because of this, approximately 70 percent of the bakers known to have written ' No Direct Employment ' reports to Paris Baguette, which has held presentations since last October, are using third-party joint ventures. About 200 of them claim they have "" agreed out of hand "", but even then, they are reluctant to hire 3,500 bakers directly to the Paris Bagette. As a result, some labor groups say that the ministry's direct employment order has resulted in increased conflicts between the headquarters, provisional branches, and suppliers as well as other workers, making everyone a loser.◇ Management and labor dialogue next week is crucial, and the ministry has left little room for it as if it were taking into consideration the situation. During the briefing on July 5, the ministry said, We will arrange for labor and management to solve the problem through dialogue, apart from starting investigations and imposing fines. When Paris Baguette announced the intention, the union delegation, the Gamestone Association and the partners would arrange a meeting next week, Vagette said.The penalty will take some time. To be fined, bakers need to check their opposition to their jobs. Under the current law, employees who are found illegally to have sent their own jobs will be exempt from direct employment obligations."" So far, approximately 3,780 bakers have written ' No Direct Employment Assessments. ' "" "" I didn't agree yet, so I listened to the bakery operators and asked them to participate in the request. "" The official also said the ministry will convince the bakers to end the process by promising to receive a written protest against their work until they are fined.

"" National Policy Committee Chairman Lee Yong-ho said on Monday night on Monday, "" If you don't mind, you will have to write down your Facebook account on the Sunchang Baseong Regional and Imsil-Kangseong Expressway budget. Regarding Lee`s actions, the political community criticized, I think you misused the position of floor leaders to finance individual district budgets. However, Lee is not the only one in charge of budgeting in such regions. The National Assembly Special Committee on Budget and Accounts, whose budget was to be reviewed and arranged at the last minute until April 4 or 5, was busy with the last-distributing distribution of budget among lawmakers in local districts. The budget for expanding the central highway, with the district of Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, the floor leader Chung Woo-taek's constituency, increased by 800 million won and the budget for expanding the National Assembly's National Assembly's National Road No. 25 budget by 500 million won. About 125 million won was added to the operating expenses of Nowon Children's Protection Agency, which is the district of Nowon, the home of Dubul Fishermen Corp.'s floor leader Woo Won-sik.It was a Ministry of Justice budget, but it was reflected this time because the city government mistakenly failed to ask for support, Woo explained. The budget for district areas by secretary of the ruling and opposition parties also increased. The budget of 700 million won for nurturing the World Culture Cluster in Paju, Gyeonggi Province is the local project of Rep. Yun Hu-duk (the head of Paju, Gyeonggi-do). The ruling Grand National Party's secretary, Kim Do-eup (Busan Buk-Seokseo, Busan), reportedly spent 500 million won on support for Busan's Daejeo 1-dong district and 13.1 billion won on the construction of a public garage in Mieum-dong, Busan. In addition, the ruling Democratic Party's secretary general, Lee Chun-seok (Iksan A, Jeonbuk), separately asked for a budget to build sound-proof walls in Iksan station in North Jeolla Province (1.7 billion won) and another 500 million won plan to build a waste reducing waste facility in Iksan. Representative Kim Jeong-woo (Gyeonggi Gun-po), head of the main opposition Democratic Party's presidential office, raised the amount by 15 billion won from the government's plan, which was set at 5 billion won for the Kyung-Buk Subway Express Project in the Capital Region. The direct train service from Suwon also increased the budget for the KTX by 10 billion won from the previous administration. Rep. Min Kyung-wook (Incheon Yeonsueul), vice floor leader of the Korea Party, raised the total of 13.5 billion won submitted by the government for the Incheon KTX (Songdo Station departure) project. There was also ' help ' from natural disasters. Representative Kim Jeong-jae (Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province) received an additional 52.3 billion won in funds to finance the earthquake, including restoration costs and installation of shelter. It is the most related to the increase in budget of KRW 28.8 billion for the Gaephanam Line (increased by KRW 13.5 billion from the previous year) from KRW 267.7 billion for the Boseong Southern Railway (KRW 67.7 billion) and its representatives, including Rep. Yoon Young-Cheol, who is being appointed as a representative of the party representative of the government.

During the budget screening process, district lawmakers would organize their required budget items through pre-schedulers and submit them to the so-called formal screening process before the so-called opening. But the lobbying and the pressing campaigns against the so-called committee members and executives at the base are still ongoing to enforce the submitted items. In addition to the budget extension, promotional campaigns were continued to show their efforts to local residents. Rep. Kim Kyung-jin of the National Assembly, the ruling Grand National Party, had already secured 1908 billion won, including the second-stage Honam Expressway project and the Gwangju to Gangjin, before the budget was passed.

"A bear grandson adopted from North Korea in 2004 was identified as a Russian female. It is the third time that a third generation of bears, born in the natural environment of Jiri Mountain, has been identified since the restoration project began in 2004. Natural bear third generation refers to the grandson of the first generation bear, which was introduced and released by Russia and China in the past. The first bear is called the second bear from nature, and the second bears call the third bear the baby bear. The National Park Service's technical institute announced on July 6 that it has confirmed that the third generation was born naturally after capturing a one-month-old bear and analyzing its genetic material.At the time of the capture, the black bears were estimated to be two years old and weighed 56 kilograms as a healthy male. A team of scientists at the National Park Service is examining the health condition of the black bears on the half moon of Jiri Mountain. After collecting blood from captive half moon bear, researchers attached a radio transmitter to the bear and died. The research team analyzed the blood genes of the bear caught and confirmed last month that it was a third-generation individual, born naturally, from a second-generation bear. Han Sang-hyun, a research fellow at Jongbok Institute of Technology, said, The third-generation bears that were captured were born between the male polar bear in Bukhansan Mountain and a female Russian bear that was released in 2004. The bear's grandfather was born in North Korea, and his grandmother was born in Russia. The mother bear was not confirmed, but genetic analysis suggests that it is a descendant of the cloned bear. A baby half-moon breast bear has a transmitter attached to it between the ages of 8 months to 10 months, which is not easy to catch because it mostly works with its mother. As a result, some of the bears born naturally did not even undergo genetic analysis. A research team at the Korea National Park Service is collecting blood samples after capturing the black bears on the half moon of Jiri Mountain. A total of 48 black bears live on Mt. Jiri currently. The research team is set to make clear the family tree by further gene analysis since the natural birth third bear has some of the genetic material that did not appear in the original ones. We plan to secure the complete order of the half moon breast bear genes by sequencing the next generation to form a bear family management system, said Song Dong-ju, head of the office`s technical office. The next generation sequencing method not only analyzes specific regions of the DNA but reads the entire DNA sequence. The institute also plans to establish a genetic labeling system that will suit the classification of black bears. Kang Chan-soo, an environmental journalist, chansu, joongang.co. @.

Among the 3525 foreigners who visited Namisum, 67 percent (2395) were from Southeast Asian countries. There were only 50 Chinese tourists besides Hong Kong and Taiwan. Namisum, the filming location of the popular Korean drama Winter Sonata, was visited by 350,000 Chinese tourists a year. Fears were growing over a sharp decline in Chinese visitors this year due to the "" THAAD "" retaliation. Tourists from Xiah, Southeast Asian countries, take a photo in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, Tuesday under the artificial snow of a snow plow. Namisum visitors from five Southeast Asian countries are expected to soar to 568,000 this year, up from 360,000 five last year. Park Sang-hun is a brilliant but Southeast Asian tourist has made a breakthrough. The number of tourists to Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand is expected to soar from 368,000 in 2012 to 568,000 at the end of this year, more than 50 percent up from the same period. As a result, the number of Chinese who visited Namisum this year is expected to decrease by 78 percent to one fifth, but the total number of foreigners is expected to decrease by only 16 percent.There is a Korean tourism future in Namisum, where experience programs are continuously available to meet the standards of tourists, such as winter cold, snow, and bonfires, said Professor of Tourism Policy at Gaentsudo University.Tourism companies say the government should shift its policies to support qualitative growth, not the number of tourists, on the occasion of the THAAD retaliation. The high value added tourism packages should be provided, such as luxury items such as food and relaxation, cosmetic surgery, medical examination, and medical tourism including treatments for hard-to-cure illnesses. In other words, it is advised to concentrate on individual tourists who visit Korea again and again with the financial power rather than traveling together with cheap group tours focusing on shopping schedules. "" It is my second visit to Korea since I visited the island last April, and I wanted to feel the cold properly this time, "" said John Pizzina, 35, a Filipino banker who met with Namisum on July 1. His wife, who was dressed in six layers of clothing, laughed, "" The cold makes my skin feel really irritated. "" Namisum holds a snowman festival from the middle of this month.

There is also a currency exchange booth that can exchange Korean money for 16 Korean currency, including the Thai baht and the Philippine peso. The art shop, which sells dozens of souvenirs, including postcards, mugs, lighting fixtures and mask packs, under the theme of the snowman. "" Namisum is a success story of ' emotional marketing, ' "" said tourism experts.Jeon Myeong-jun, CEO of Namisum Corporation, explained, "" We have pursued a diversification strategy five or six years ago in Southeast Asian countries, where the economy has doubled the number of new, affluent middle class people. "" We held a joint event with embassies in Korea from Southeast Asian countries, and visited the World Travel Fair, he said. As the "" Life Essential Experience Course "" was rumored to be among the burning autumn foliage and winter cold by Namisum for those familiar with tropical climates, the slow transition to Southeast Asian countries was made during the peak season.

"Top tax rates 22 % → Top 10 % increased by 10 companies by 1.3 trillion won (Jun-3 trillion won) "" Reduce investment and employment by 0.3 % next year. "" "" 70 or so targeted, "" and "" 22 points out of concern, "" global corporate tax hike should be made Samsung Electronics is also expected to pay 400 billion won in more taxes. Experts say the government should actively seek to improve the business environment by streamlining quasI-tax burden reduction regulations to offset the negative effects of corporate tax hikes. The National Assembly Budget Office paid an estimated amount of 57.9 trillion won in 2015 to the top 10 companies based on their financial statements and data on credit rating agencies ' Nice evaluation data in March 2017. Based on the analysis made on July 5, the Hankook Ilbo found that when the highest rate of corporate tax is raised to 25 percent, the corporate tax rate of the 10 largest companies will grow by a total of 1.3-3,378.8 billion won. This is an assumption that there are no various deductions or tax rates, such as R&D ; or tax reduction for foreign payment, and a calculation of the highest standard of assessment based on the corporate tax (estimate). Samsung Electronics is the company with the highest tax burden. Samsung Electronics paid an estimated 3.28 trillion won in corporate tax in 2015, with the corporate tax burden rising 3 percentage points to 425.3 billion won. Hyundai Motors (280 billion won), Korea Electric Power Corporation (156.5 billion won), SK Hynix (133.4 billion won), and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Company (112.5 billion won) were also included in the analysis. Moreover, the tax burden on the top companies could grow even larger, considering that R&D ; and facility investment tax deductions will be reduced starting next year. The government expects the additional tax revenue effect of 2.3 trillion won (77 billion U.S. dollars) per year from the hike in corporate tax rates. As the actual corporate tax payment is not disclosed and the deductions and deductions are quite different, we can`t accurately estimate the additional tax burden for individual companies, said an official at the ministry.Experts are divided over the economic effects of the tax hikes. Kim Hak-soo, a researcher at the Korea Institute of Public Finance, said, "" If we raise the corporate tax rates for companies with more than 200 billion won (129 locations), our investment (fixed capital formation) and employment (total number of employees) decreased by 0.2 percent, respectively. If we analyze them as companies with more than 300 billion won in tax base, the results will not change much, Kim said. On the other hand, Park Ki-bak, a professor at Seoul National University, argued, With only 70 companies facing corporate tax hikes and their good business conditions, the economy won`t be affected. Some worry that raising alone in the global trend of corporate tax cuts could accelerate companies ` exodus from Korea. In the U.S., the Senate passed a tax reform package that reduces the maximum rate of corporate tax from 35 percent to 20 percent since 2019. Japan is also planning to reduce the maximum tax rate of corporate tax by 20 percent, which is 29.97 percent. As a result, anti-company tax hikes are raising calls for companies to step up efforts to improve their environments. Professor Oh Moon-sung at Hanyang University in Seoul said, We should reduce the tax burden on quasI-tax patients, including legal contributions, donations and donations. We need to minimize the negative effects of the corporate tax hikes by streamlining regulations and supporting technological development, a state-run think tank said. Sejong : Park Jun-seok, reporter at pjs@hankookilbo.comPresident Xi Jinping, who declared construction of what would be considered a typical Chinese socialism in the new era, is shaking in his power during the 19th National Assembly of the People's Republic of Korea in October. Unlike his promise to create a socialist society, which we all live well together, resistance began to him as the weak were increasingly discriminated against and excluded from the public arena.It began with Beijing City Secretary ChatchI, who is close to Xi. A fire broke out at a farming community in Soon-I Gu, Beijing on November 10. It was Donald Trump, the United States president is visiting China. According to Hong Kong's Myung-bo, Xi called The Tagger and said, "" Who are you going to show this to? Get immediate measures. The difference is the key aide Xi raised since he was a storage worker, who rose from the ranks of non-member to become a member of the political bureau. The immediate difference was the establishment of the Rural Community Construction Plan.Eight days after the fire broke out, another fire broke out again in the slums of Dashing, southern Beijing. It was a tragic accident in which 19 farmers and fishermen were burnt to death. The difference ordered an immediate "" fire prevention and clean-up campaign "" to be carried out. It is a move to dispose of all illegal buildings in 40 days.Beijing City authorities have named it a ' dirty work of Di dwanlanquau (low and low class) '. The railroad team mopped up the slums with heavy equipment, not even one day to spare. In Beijing alone, a whopping 135 branches were hit.On social networking services in China, hashtags of resistance saying, "" I am low class myself "" spread like air. About 100 intellectuals issued a statement calling for an end to the demolition process, while Tsinghua University students took part in a campaign to investigate the illegal activities of the team against ousted farmers and fishermen.Authorities decided against the use of the word "" lowlife, "" and began to delete it, while watching intellectuals and university students. As the situation was unusual, the secretary for political affairs visited the working areas of farmers and civil engineers on July 3. "" Thank you for your hard work, "" AnhuI's shoe repairman said. "" I will make Beijing warm. "" But on the Internet, a cynical article, "" Is this a new era? "" is playing hide-and-seek with the authorities ' censorship.The heating turbulence, also raised doubts about the Chinese government's ability to address the needs of the people. The government has banned coal heating in northern areas such as Hubei, Shanxi, Shandong and Inner Mongolia in a bid to remove smog during the winter. Local officials who failed to increase the smog free day compared to last year are subject to punishment. Non-gas officials have eliminated even the most unfed coal boiler. Rural hospitals have filed a petition to the government, warning that the delivery of critical care operations and the heating of baby rooms could be hampered.Natural gas prices jumped from 3,000 yuan (490,000 won) to 7,000 yuan per ton in just 15 days. Despite warnings from authorities, gas companies have not solved the price-fixing process. The South China Morning Post (SCMP) said on July 5, "" There is no way to meet demand unless we have a supply system such as gas storage and plumbing. ""As the public's discontent grows, the government is accusing the bureaucrats. "" There are more than 100 reasons to replace coal with natural gas, but there is no reason to freeze the population, "" the city mayor said. However, the media criticism is only directed at local governments. Only officials of the district office were punished for the fire in Dashingu.Beijing correspondent Lee Chang-gu window2@seoul.co.kr"
"A Proposal by Dong-A Ilbo as an Expert TF - The Government is setting out to address the so-called "" paradox of minimum wage hikes. "" By preventing high-paid workers from receiving minimum wage hikes, the government can open its target of an era of 10,000 won in minimum wage and reduce harm to small and mid-sized employers. The government will draw up a final revision plan by January next year at the latest after receiving opinions from public hearings. The minimum wage system will change drastically starting in 2019, according to the ministry`s schedule. However, labor circles and some ruling party lawmakers are expected to suffer considerable pain during the parliamentary discussion as they strongly oppose the current system, with the minimum wage of 10,000 won.○ (親) a labor policy strategy of track to pro-labor policies for Moon Jae-in The government presents transfer of the minimum wage reflect the needs of the business community claims government was rapid.Side effects and any damages due to a minimum wage hike could could become uncontrollable sense of urgency. The ruling and opposition parties have reflected 2.97 trillion won in next year`s budget for job security funds, which the government directly supports after suffering, but the government also made it a promise to indirectly support the National Assembly, not to provide cash support. Small and mid-sized businesses and small businesses could suffer a direct hit from the forecast of 8,000 won per hour in near-zero wage earners. That is why some analysts say the government is pushing ahead with its two-track strategy to drive income growth and innovation at the same time. To lay the groundwork for the minimum wage increase, the nation's wage system needs to be adapted to the global standard. The minimum wage range is smaller than that of developed countries, and the current wage system with lower basic wage and higher pay raises the minimum wage of 10,000 won, and the government's policy to make non-regular workers regular workers available is various.○ The minimum wage for next year will be 7530 won per hour, and 157,700 won per month (based on a 40-hour workweek). The problem is that with the steep rise in minimum wage, the ' paradox of minimum wage ' is really appearing. According to the Korea Employers Federation, the basic wage is 1.4 million won, and among the production companies, regular bonuses and various benefits are not less than 40 million won. Bonuses and allowances are blamed on the ' improper payments ' structure, which provides more than basic salary. However, the worker will also receive a basic salary of at least 7.57 million won starting next year, depending on the minimum wage increase. Workers who earn more than 40 million won a year will benefit from the minimum wage increase. This is a phenomenon stemming from the current minimum wage purchase range that includes basic wages, but not regular bonuses, extension benefits, and welfare benefits (such as food and lodging costs). The business community has constantly called for the inclusion of regular bonuses and welfare benefits in the scope of their purchases. In addition, small businesses such as convenience stores and restaurants have insisted on a lower minimum wage difference for many years, but it failed to become reality due to labor opposition. The alternatives announced by the Korea Minimum Wage Council's expert task force on July 5 included regular bonuses as the minimum wage and reflected the opinions of the business community, including the differentiation of salaries. Including regular bonuses in the minimum wage range would reduce the burden of a basic pay increase. However, experts also suggested that employers who do not keep the minimum wage should pay a maximum of twice the amount of overdue wage to their employees. It intends to increase the real minimum wage by imposing stronger sanctions on owners who buy more minimum wage but who violate the law.Could we overcome the labor counter`s backlash? Labor groups are criticizing expanding access to the mountain as a "" trick "" to disable minimum wage hikes. We can discuss the issue after we reach an hourly rate of 10,000 won, said Kim Joo-young, head of the Federation of Korean Trade Unions. The two umbrella labor groups visited the offices of minimum wage committee chairman Eosu-bong, who also referred to the need to revamp the range of entry into the nation during parliamentary audit and inspection session. The two umbrella labor groups also branded Hong Young-pyo, chairman of the National Assembly`s Environmental Labor Relations Committee, as anti-labor. Moon Jae-in government friendly (友軍) in labor and a head-on collision that can be part of the work. Experts agree that the structure of deciding the minimum wage should be changed altogether to avoid intense labor-management disputes surrounding the minimum wage. However, the bill did not include measures on decision structures. We should think about how to set the minimum wage in an independent body composed of government experts, such as the Bank of Korea`s Monetary Policy Committee, which sets the benchmark rate, said Kwon Hyuk, a law professor at Pusan National University.Yoo Seong-yeol, a reporter at The Dong-A Ilbo, officially called for Facebook to be dismissed by the Dong-A Ilbo, and Kim Jeong-gyeom (click!), the chief executive of the court's ruling and opposition parties ' court's recommendation, was withdrawn from the broadcast.According to legal circles on July 6, part 51 of the Seoul Southern District Court's decision to suspend the decision of the Board of Directors Lee In-cheol, Kwon Hyuk-cheol and Kim Kwang-dong on the same day was rejected.They argued on whether to hold an provisional committee meeting on July 22 and that it would be fully informed of the possibility of disobeying the chairman by calling for a regular board meeting on July 2 and that the next regular board of directors would be scheduled to be held on July 16, and that it was not necessary to hold an interim board meeting between visitors.The decision to fire Kim Jang-kyum, chairman of the Presidential Office, was approved at a special Board of Directors meeting on July 13.

There were no physical clashes between the ruling and opposition parties, but they had to go through a series of violent protests, ancient castles and even all-night discussions. Until the budget bill was approved within three and a half hours of the opening of the plenary session, the final scene was made several times, in which the supplementary budget bill could have been rejected or even failed to pass the vote.The moment when the budget bill was ready to be approved began when National Assembly Chairman Chung Se-kyun decided to enforce the opening of the plenary session at 9:50 p.m. on July 5. The National Assembly originally planned to hold a plenary session at 11:00 a.m. on July 5 to deal with the budget. Chairman Chung delivered the same idea to the parties in the late afternoon of July 4 when the three leaders agreed on the budget issues. However, the budget settlement committee held an overnight meeting on July 5, but the details of the dispute were delayed, and due to the budget adjustment by the Strategy and Finance Ministry, the budget plan could be submitted later this day. In response, Chairman Chung had to hold a general meeting at 11:00 a.m. and declare the meeting adjourned immediately.A notice was sent to ruling and opposition party lawmakers that the plenary session will resume at 9:00 p.m. yesterday, signaling that it will be dealt with. However, it was past 9 o'clock again and Chung decided to resume the plenary session at 9:50, in recognition that he could not delay the budget proposal. The liberal party decided to oppose the proposed budget of the three parties during the general meeting, and did not attend.But Chung's decision, on the contrary, was a trigger of protest among members of the Korea Party. While proposing a revision to the Income Tax Act following the voting of a revision to the National Tax Service's corporate tax law, the late floor leaders of the main opposition Grand National Party, Kwonseon-dong, and Chang strongly protested against Chung.They blocked the meeting by saying, No main opposition party has held a plenary session without a parliamentary presence. Members of the Korea Party who finished their services joined the rally, causing more than 30 minutes of fuss and having to make a closing call.The people's strategic voting without any party platform was highlighted. According to the result of voting on the floor of the National Assembly, only four voted against the corporate tax law. Only 15 people opposed the budget. As a result, it is interpreted that the people's party members raised an objection to corporate tax while concentrating their energy on the budget proposal.For this reason, some analyze that if the Korea Party participated in the corporate tax vote, it would have lost the vote. It was a time when the National Assembly laid bare its status as a "" election boat, "" a situation that could be too burdensome for the government or the ruling party.The biggest factor in the passage of the budget can be contradictively found in the GNP.

In addition, we have delivered the classified information to Choi for the benefit of the K-Sport involved in Choi, and released the classified information on the job, said the guilty verdict, reflecting the gravity of the crime and its status. Jang was sentenced to jail for the first time in about six months. Chang was previously brought to trial on Dec. 8 last year and was released from jail on June 8 at 12 a.m. for the expiration of the arrest period. Upon the first release of the accused who was arrested for state affairs, the prosecution did not request that Jang issue a warrant for his arrest, considering that he actively cooperated with the investigation, called the Independent Counsel's Boktop. However, the court arrested Jang again on the same day, judging that he might be on the road due to his sentence. We would like to ask him to leave the boy when he and his two are still together, Chang said, Considering his sincere involvement in the investigation and trial by the prosecution, we don`t want you to be arrested. Chang and Kim were put to trial on charges of colluding Choi and pressuring Samsung Group and the G.K.L. to sponsor the Center for genius. Jang was also accused of embezzling about 300 million won in funds from the Center for the Advancement of Genius and of 700 million won in state subsidies.

U.S. consumer magazine Consumer Reports released its overall test results on the iPhone X on July 5, saying, "" The iPhone X is an innovative device with fantastic cameras and a beautiful display, "" and added that "" the iPhone X is also a lasting device. "" Although Consumer Reports did not report a specific ranking, Apple Insider reported that the iPhone X was ranked ninth behind Samsung's Galaxy S8.and iPhone 8 series. Consumer reporter put it in a small bowl and did a tumbling test to expose the device to different angles of shock. One of the three iPhone X devices said it was in good working order until the fifth round, but the crack was still felt Two other test equipments also said the display malfunctioned after 50 turns and although the windshield was not broken, sharp green lines appeared up and down. Consumer Reports say "" Samsung's Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus of glass were still subject to reports of such damage to the display and cracks in the back panel. "" But Apple stores reported a repair item on the display of $ 549. That means the difference in repair costs has led to a discrepancy in scores. Even in battery life, the iPhone X was 19 hours and 30 minutes, far below the 26 hours of the Galaxy S8 and S8-Plus. Regarding the results of the tests, Apple said that "" Consumer Report's tests were based on a ' rigorous real world test ' of the durability of the iPhone X.

"▽ Debate : Gone Korean Economy Studies (3) · Korean Missionaries on Short Track Performance = The first or second year of no Korean studies, U.S., and young professors ' worries about Korean history … Professor Asmogluch has explored the subject since he was 30, four years after becoming an assistant professor at MIT. He crossed politics and economics during this period. So his conclusion is, the system determines the rise and fall of the nation. The countries with an inclusive political and economic system were cheerful ; the ones with exploitative political and economic systems were in decline. His theory was a huge hit and is called the "" new local theory. "" Is it possible in Korea?Asmoglu is from Turkey. She earned her doctorate degree from London School of Economics (LSE) in the U.K. and received the position of assistant professor at MIT at the age of 26. Since then, he has worked on long-term projects that deal with the rise and fall of the nation. The academic community said, It is hard to dream of becoming a Korean.In the United States and Korea, the recruitment and personnel system is different. Every year, the American Economic Association (JAMA) holds a seminar in January, and a job market is opened for doctoral graduates. Ph.D graduates are given opportunities to interview each university professor and introduce themselves to their studies. Professor of Economics at Seoul National University Hong Seok-chul said, It is to pick a refreshing doctor based on the potential interview, seminar and doctoral degree.Major political scientists such as Paul Krugman, a professor of economics at New York University of Science and Harvard University, Gregory Mankyu, have walked down the path of an economist from the early 20s to the early 40s.Even after recruitment, American universities guarantee considerable research freedom. Usually, a newly hired professor with a doctoral degree is given six years until the tenure examination, but the first one or two years are not required to give lectures or write a dissertation. For example, the ancient city of Chicago in the United States does not require any quantitative research in six years. However, the evaluation is not to be trifled with. One professor, who studied in ancient Chicago, said, "" The demand to publish the best paper, no matter how long it takes, continues even after you have tenure.Korea is in a different world. In short, Korean universities demand that they write a lot of good papers. The same is true of Seoul, the nation's No.1 city. Professor A. Keyne, who teaches economics at an American university, said, If Keynesian survives again, he can not become a professor at SNU. A young economist who has just received a doctorate degree at Seoul National University, who requires an average of 4 to 5 papers to be published from the recruitment stage, explains that it is difficult to submit documents.Professor of Economics at Seoul National University Ryu Keun-kwan also stated, "" It is impossible realistically impossible for a novice researcher to pass SNU's appointment standards. ""Even after hiring professors, it is not easy to engage in mid - to long-term research. Seoul National University usually goes through three screening procedures in the nine years after recruitment. The screening process for the re-appointment is waiting two years after recruitment, followed by the review of the promotion of associate professors in two years and the confirmation of retirement age in five years. The undergraduate level evaluates the quality of the research, but the next level is the quantity of the paper. Three to four papers should be published in the top 20 academic journals for approximately nine years to meet the standard. Many professors publish papers and policy studies in Korean academic journals as if they are to make amends in order to fill the gap. Even if they fail to fill out their Nobel Prize papers, they can not get tenure at SNU. After the security of retirement, various limitations disappear, but many professors lose interest in research. This is because the difference in rewards based on research results is small.It is similar in all Korean universities. In a survey of 50 Korean economists last month, 88 percent answered that `` an evaluation of performance that emphasizes quality over quality of the paper hinders both innovative research and long-term research. '' Some professors who are eager to study may refuse to secure retirement age and move to U.S. universities. The reality is that some academics need to assess the quantity of papers before they can do any research, said Han, adding that the Korean economy should change its professor evaluation system to ensure a stage in growth.Bank of Korea, such as Hwang Jeong-hwan, reporter jung@hankyung.com' Among the 2,300 workers, 170 doctors in economics (as of the end of September) were the largest in Korea.However, it is rare to speak out on current economic issues. The closed and isolated Han River is called Haneunsa Temple because it looks like a temple. As the former senior central bank official strongly argued in the past, `` Structural reform is urgent, '' adding, `` Be careful with that, '' the government did not say so.Many say that the report released by the Bank of Korea is also vague. The central bank began issuing a report on economic issues called the BOK Issue Note in 2012. However, he decreased the number of presentations every year and never made them this year. An economist at the central bank`s monetary union said, There are a number of reports that the central bank does not study and disclose internally, and if they differ from the government policies, they can filter out the reports.Critics say that not only analysis of pending issues, but also mid - to long-term studies are insufficient. Lee Joo-yeol, president of the Bank of Korea, who took office in 2014, reiterated that the Korean economy has increased its growth potential, and although research efforts on the low and mid-aged population has been focused on the task this year, the lack of human resources and excessive workload has been focused on the priority.BOK officials also stressed that the state-run think tank is too small compared to the size of Korea`s economy, and they need to strengthen their research capabilities and capabilities to produce an insight report.The situation at state-run research institutes is similar. The Korea Development Institute, Korea`s leading think tank, described the nation's future strategy in the past. Not now. This is because the center of gravity of the economy has shifted from public to private markets, but also because of this shorter "" breath of research "".As before, it is hard for KDI to make an initiative, said one professor at the KDI, adding, Writing a report customized to suit the government`s taste reduces the sense of mission. An economics professor at the national university said, Not only the KDI but also the state-run think tank is basically a government service agency, adding, We usually have to make a lot of copying reports within two or three months as requested by the ordering office, according to a study conducted by foreigners. Of course, we have to watch the government's face.The relocation of the state-run think tank to Sejong City has also hurt research capabilities. This is because the middle-aged researchers, who used to be the waist of organizations, left en masse during the relocation process of Sejong City. Some say, Some state-run think tanks used to be more well-respected than SNU in the past, but now they are treated like stops to take care of their careers.Kim Eun-jung, a journalist at Piketty Theater in Korea, has sold more than 2.2 million copies in the past three decades because of lack of proper statistics. His argument that the inequality in capital gains is bound to deepen (r > g) above the rate of economic growth, coupled with growing public dissatisfaction with the inequality in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. It was so called that it was called Piketty's.Of course, before Piketty, there were many theories pointing out the inequality in wealth. Nevertheless, his argument is not driven by abstract theories but by his active use of specific statistics. Instead of using fancy mathematical techniques, he drew the theory of r > g from past 300 years of tax data from 20 countries, including Britain and France.Therefore, the argument over the Piketty theory has become a key issue not with the direction of the theory but with the accuracy of the data. The Financial Times (FT) challenged Piketty's data to be inaccurate, while Piketty denounced it as a ' simplifying process for analysis '.Korea lacks the basic philosophical and historical intellectual property that American and European researchers naturally learn, said Lee Joon-koo, an honorary professor at Seoul National University's economics department.Academic officials who have worked at state-run think tanks also say, "" Korea lacks diversity of data and lacks reliability in existing data, "" adding, It is necessary but not costly to produce data.Kim Soon-sin, reporter gija soonsin2@hankyung.com[ [globang] [cell phone subscription] ⑨ Korean economy & hankyung.com, no trafficking or redistribution"
"[Money and the 300] Country Senior Secretary for Arms Control Moon Jeong-hwa : "" We can not appeal to Cheong Wa Dae for a revision to the sex crimes law. / The presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae's civil affairs office is requesting an amendment to the revised law on July 12, 2011. "" The senior presidential secretary for civil affairs appeared on the daily social networking service "" Cheong Wa Dae is at 11:50, "" saying so with the host presidential spokesperson Ko Min-jung in a bold manner. The statement was in response to "" No to Cho Doo-soon's release from prison, "" which was received as a public petition by the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae. "" No matter what you answered, the victim or your family would be nervous. "" Cho said, adding, "" I would block any action that the current law department can take, or I would make you feel uneasy about it. "" Regarding the case of Cho Doo-soon, Cho said, "" Even though we agree on the issue of the law, we can not pass a plea to abolish the system of prohibition of sexual assault, considering the fact that the alcohol use of alcohol in the eyes and mind is weak. "" The presidential office answered, "" This is the third time that the petition has been made, and the third time it has been made, Cho Doo-soon, and the fourth time it has been filed, respectively. We can not accept anger in our country, but we can not appeal to Cho Doo-soon. Cho then explained, "" I deeply sympathize with the anger of the petition participants, "" but was found guilty and found not guilty despite the conviction, and was therefore only punished by making clear that the guilty person could be reindisted. "" In addition, Cho may have to wear an electronic anklet for seven years in addition to his 12-year jail term and undergo probation by the Justice Ministry, adding that access to certain areas is not enough, but access to certain areas is prohibited. Lee's personal information will also be disclosed for five years. Cho promised that the government will make sure that he will not be able to wander around the victim or potential victims. The investigation prosecutors made the error of applying the criminal law rather than the special law on sexual violence, and the prosecutors in charge of the trial gave up their appeal, Cho said, Of course, the two were disciplined. The court also explained, Once we opted for a life sentence, Cho was sentenced to 12 years in jail for admitting he was intoxicated.The victim took the CSAT this time, Cho Doo-soon said, The victims will not succumb to the harm they suffered, but they will win their lives with dignity, along with the people. Cho is known as Na-yeong, an alias, at the beginning of the incident, but the victim is usually called by the perpetrator due to concerns about causing secondary damage. Sexual Offences Assessment Criteria / Supplied by Cheong Wa Dae -As a request, it is not possible to ' see a man commit a crime ', Cho said. He continued to expand the penalty assessment criteria for sexual crimes under 13 years of age, along with his experiences as a member of the Supreme Court's penalty committee for two years starting in 2009. The Special Law on Sexual Violence has been tightened since the incident of Cho Doo-soon, allowing the law to ban sex offenders from having an emotional environment. Although the Act was "" not applicable, "" the revised Supreme Court penalty law (November 2011) stipulated that "" the state of intoxication is not to be reflected deliberately as a reducing factor. "" The sentence is "" impossible "" to reduce for drunk sex offenders because they are sentenced to jail according to the law. However, it is not mandatory to apply a comprehensive visual inspection on sex crimes (no), saying, "" The criminal code does not require a separate review clause. "" According to the presidential office, the Criminal Law Act 10, the Mental Disorders Act 53, and the Minimization of the Amount of alcohol could apply to drunk crimes. Regarding the bill to exclude drinking from the mental and physical disability categories and eliminate the source of the decline, Cho responded, A bill will be proposed and a public hearing will take place at the National Assembly. The criminal law revision bill, which disallows the criminal acts of those who willingly drink alcohol or suffer mental and physical disabilities, was proposed by Shin Chang-hyun, a fisherman's representative. It shows that Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling party have joined forces on the issue.▽ Condition of re-crimination of sex crimes / provision of Cheong Wa Dae by Cho Doo-soon and the refusal of the highest number of cases to leave the office = Cho said, "" Fifty-six percent of sexual offenders who committed sexual violence against their children are not as important, and 11.2 percent of those who are being reinned in need are being disciplined. "" Along with punishing the perpetrators, protection and support for the victims is very important, and we provide enrollment support, including legal counseling, counseling programs and transfer to victims and their families. We will continue to consider the role of the government.Cho Doo-soon's petition against the release received 613,154 consent as of July 5. This is the largest number of petitions ever. It was a petition that began before the petition was limited to one month, and it does not match what Cheong Wa Dae sees as its answer of 200,000 occasions per month. Nevertheless, the public interest was so high that they were the target of responses. The petition with the exception of the National Assembly on Tuesday ended with 217,674 people who participated in the petition. The head of the country officially answered to the petition calling for the abolition of abortion laws and the revision of the boy's law.

"" Because the appeals system itself is guilty, it turns out to be only for the good of the punished person, with clear evidence of innocence or lack of evidence, "" Cho said. It appears to have reduced the scope of controversy by providing clear legal grounds, albeit a little different from the public's, response to the people's ' sentiments of the law.

Regarding the reduction of alcohol intake, Cho explained that the special law on sexual violence has been tightened since the case of Cho Doo-soon, so the law can not apply to drunk sex crimes. Sexual assault is a petition that says, ' It's impossible to watch a person commit something while drinking.

"Samsung Heavy Industries Crane - Black Disaster Strikes on the West Sea on December 7, 2007, Residents who gave up and cleaned up after a miracle on the Sea, People who recovered from the oil spill in 2014 : 10 % Crocken Oil Refuges Project The open mudflat began to submerge in the sea water as the tide rose. Villagers who went for oyster fishing took one or two packages and went ashore. Kim Hyeong-su (right), a couple of days before the Taean Oil spill, digs a hole in Uihang-ri, Sowon-myeon, Taean-gun, South Chungcheong Province yesterday. This year, oysters are in full bloom and are in good harvest. Newscaster Hinchul Daugaiah ' roared up the slope from the mudflat to land. The overhead bin with the three ladies was stuffed with oysters. "" Have you got a good catch? "" the uncle grinned brightly. About 10 minutes later, an old woman with a black bag in her hand, with a basket, climbed the slope panting. She came back from the mudflat at 8 a.m. in 6 hours, taking the oysters out of her basket and handing them over : "" Taste it once. "" The oysters were salty when they were put in the mouth, but they sued each time they chewed. It was a natural oyster taken outside Taean. Nature's Cave, a local residents ’ natural products collected from the seashore in Uihang-ri, Sowon-myeon, Taean-gun, Chungcheongnam-do, Korea on July 5. `` This is to be done. I don't know anywhere else, but I don't. "" "" Please let me know that the sea is clear here, "" she said, urging me to dig more oysters. At the plastic house near the coast, Kim Hyeong-su (77) and Park Hee-ja (73, female) were digging their hole. It is the morning of the day when I went out to the mud flats to enjoy caon. We have been married more than 50 years and have lived in the town this year. Wholesale merchants lined up to buy oysters here. Villagers who gathered oysters in Uihang-ri, Sowon-myeon, Taean-gun, Chungcheongnam-do, Korea The residents said, "" You can eat Uihang-ri oyster because it is the most delicious and clean. "" It was only three to four years ago that the oyster harvest took place in the village of Uihang 2-ri, Shinjinho. Before that time, oysters would die with their shells spread out, or they would not be able to look around at all. It was the effect of the oil spill in Taean in December 2007. The children said, Let's go out to town and live together, but the villagers were unable to rear the sea. It was the home where he lived all his life. We have not seen an oyster in the sea for six to seven years after the oil accident, the Kims said. We had only rough rocks, said the oyster has been looking for shape a little since three years ago, and this year we have more crops than before it was damaged by oil. Residents of Uihang-ri, Sowon-myeon, Taean-gun, Chungcheongnam-do, Korea gathered oysters in the sea and went ashore on a whipper. "" This year, the oysters are fresh and tastes good, "" residents said. Shin Jin-ho is the seventh day of the oil spill in Taean, South Chungcheong Province, which will mark the 10th anniversary of the accident. At 7:06 a.m. on December 7, 2007, a sea crane at Samsung Heavy Industries and the oil tanker Hebespirit collided off Mallipo Beach in Taean County, South Chungcheong Province. An accident left a hole in the oil tanker, and 10 to 25 kiloliters of crude oil poured into the sea. The blue sea turned into a black disaster in a flash. It was the worst ever recorded time for an ocean pollution accident. Crude oil has sailed to shore on the birds and covered the rocks and sand from six cities and counties in South Chungcheong Province, each 70 kilometers long, including Taean. Residents could not believe it when they saw the dark sea. That is because the sea was perfectly fine, where they dug and dug before yesterday. December 7 is the exact same day as 10 years after the Taean oil spill. Black oil covered Taean from South Chungcheong Province when a Samsung Heavy Marine crane collided with an oil tanker off the coast of Taean on December 7, 2007. The above pictures show Taean Mallipo Beach colored with black oil belts in December 2007, and the picture below shows Mallipo Beach, which has regained its blue emerald color 10 years ago, but the pictures showed strong Taean residents. I took the equipment right away and went out to sea. He gave up his livelihood and fought against oil. The people helped. Right after the accident, 12.3 million volunteers went to the scene of the accident to drain the oil. The sight of the volunteers full of shore impressed the world. Thanks to the efforts, the West Coast quickly recovered and the clean ocean water recovered. The people called it the ' miracle of the West Sea. ' ◇ Taean has made a remarkable recovery after 10 years of a clean sea oil spill that was repaired before the accident. Fishing crabs, tiger shrimps, and rockfish, the major fisheries products of Taean, have recovered to their former levels. Recently, Taean has turned into a new producer of squid, with the formation of squid fisheries, a turbulent species. About 5,000 workers are working to control oil spill waters off Taean for the third day on December 9, 2007. Fishermen explained that the annual average annual production of baby clams increased more than before the accident, although the harvest decreased slightly this spring due to drought. In September to October, wild tiger prawn were caught an average of one to three tons a day off Taean's sandy beach. At an international forum held one year after the oil spill, environmental experts around the world said the accident would "" cause long-term ecological and environmental degradation in Taean, "" adding, "" It will be difficult to undo the accident even after decades. "" However, their predictions were groundless. Two years after the accident, the rate of clam deaths in late 2009 was 4.7 percent, a sharp decline from the 24.6 percent recorded in 2003. The concentration of sea oil near Taean has also decreased by half in the previous year. The green light for restoring the ecosystem has turned on, residents welcomed. The oil spill off Taean, South Chungcheong Province, damaged an oyster, manila clam, and abalone farm on Dec. 7, 2007 when crude oil hit the coast. At the time, residents in Taean County's Uihang 2-ri, Sowon-myeon farm look sadly at an oyster covered with oil. In June last year, more than 100 Sangchoknyeon, an endangered species, was seen swimming in groups off Taean. The rare species found only in Korea, and the Jockmas-shaped, pea-necked shellfish from Taean, also reappeared in 2010, three years after the oil spill. Lepas live on rocks 10 meters deep and eat algae. He was later found twice in Taean. Last January, the IUCN (IUCN) raised its Taean Coast National Park Level from Category V (Landscape Protection Area) to Category II (National Park). The IUCN groups the World Wide Area into six types, and the change from a landscape protected area to a national park rating means Taean Sea has excellent ecological value and good governance and conservation. Port of Mohang, Taean-gun, Chungnam Province. 10 years ago an oil spill turned the port into a ruin, but volunteers and residents made it into a pristine area. Indicators representing the Marine Ecosystem are also improving rapidly. Residual oil wealth accounted for 69.2 percent of Taean's total coast, according to the National Park Service's Oil Pollution Center's long-term monitoring of ecological impacts of the Hebespirit Oil spill in 2014. Residual oil is the extent to which oil penetrates into the beach or beneath the surface. The number of species appearing after the accident increased 37 percent at the end of last year. The index also decreased by 34 percent. The decrease in seasonal fluctuations indicates that the species that emerged due to the pollution of the ecosystem have disappeared and their existing habitats have become stable. Lee Baek, the president of the Korean company, walks with tourists visiting Taean Bay Resort in South Chungcheong Province yesterday. Freelance researcher Kim Seong-tae and the rest of the tasks such as a rapid increase in leukemia and an economic boom were also held at Chungnam National University on July 4 to discuss ways to deal with the oil spill. Discussions have continued over the results of the past decade, including restoration of the marine ecology, restoration of the productivity of fish stocks, activation of tours, and conclusion of a trial for damages. A number of other solutions were also proposed, including improvements in the system to prevent accidents, the health of local residents, and the revitalization of the local economy. Taean-gun, Chungnam Province announced a survey results that showed a surge in the rates of prostate cancer and leukemia in Taean after an oil spill. According to the research, Taean County showed a relatively high incidence of prostate cancer and leukemia compared to other counties with similar personalities. Gureumpo Beach, Sowon-myeon, Taean-gun, Chungnam Province. The beach turned black in December 2007 when an oil spill happened, but volunteers and residents turned efforts into clean beaches. The incidence of prostate cancer among reporters Shin Jin-ho rose 154 % from 12.1 per 100,000 people in 2004-2008 to 30.7 people in 2009-2013. Leukemia rose by 54 % from 5.6 per 100,000 people in 2004-2008 to 8.6 persons in 2009-2013. Park Myeong-sook, head of the environmental health center at Taean County Health and Medical Center, said, We are continuing to investigate the health effects of the victims since the oil spill, defining it as a time to clearly deal with oil spill and health problems. Chungnam and Taean-gun believe the sea has regained its former shape but that it will take considerably more time to heal the wounds of residents. To do so, they say that precise epidemiological surveys and outstanding compensation should be solved. A sign installed at Gureumpo Beach in Taean, Chungnam Province. When the oil spill happened in 2007, the narrow path was turned into a big street with volunteers following it. '"
"It is made into a ' sea route, ' and is frequently visited by tourists. The lawsuit involving the outflow of oil by journalist Shin Jin-ho was settled with 99.88 percent nationwide, and 99.92 percent in Chungnam Province. Chungnam Province is in the process of filing lawsuits against the ruling camp for five cases, and for the third and third trial cases. Lee Seong-tae, a researcher at the Korea Culture and Tourism Institute, said, "" Considering the rapidly changing tourism trends and nature of Taean, we needed to boost marine leisure sports and develop drama programs, and we needed to develop a slow-screen tourism program. "" Taean : Shinjinho Joongang.co.CRT, reporter of Shinjinho Shinjin.Korea.Korea, KING-Korea Research Center for Industrial Policy Redistributions, http://joongang.co.kr The business areas of the advanced taxi service Kakao Taxi Black and Uber Black were extended to metropolitan cities and provinces. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced a revision bill Thursday that would enact a law on the implementation of the law on passenger motor vehicle quality projects.According to the revision to the "" Combined Reservations Cab "" (picture of Yonhap news agency), taxis with large combination (picture of 13 people or more) are allowed to travel by bus suddenly. However, it shall obtain the permission of the competent authorities. Currently, only large passenger taxis with fewer than 10 passengers are available for operation in military areas. Large fare taxis are blocked from doing business. Because of this, small group tours and city tours using large combination taxis such as Hyundai Sollatti and Benz sprinters are conducted in Seoul, but such services are not available in military areas. Along with the improvement in the environment, the ministry officials said the measure will help local authorities use taxis for transportation convenience for rural and mountainous seniors. In farming and fishing villages, many elderly people often go to market with their parents, and rather than calling two taxis, it is more economical for them to travel to one large taxi cab. In addition, transportation service operators are not to be harmed as they receive charges from local governments. The government did not need to hire expensive buses to rent or take a nearby town to get to the nearby suburbs or take a tour. If a large scale taxi cab taxi cab fare was used as a courtesy taxi cab fare, the relevant subway system would be more convenient. As such, the area will be expanded to accommodate the operations of high-end taxi service providers such as Kakao Black and Uber Black. For example, luxury taxis currently licensed by Seongnam of Gyeonggi-do may accommodate visitors to nearby cities such as Seoul and Suwon, but must be returned to Seongnam after they have been dropped off. In this case, you can not work in Seoul or Suwon waiting for customers, and you can only pick up customers on the way to Seongnam. Once a revision is implemented, the government will be able to wait in the area and pick up passengers even after it drops its customers at Seoul and Suwon. As most high-end taxi services are operated on reservations, the impact on the existing taxi market won`t be so great, said an official at the ministry, responding to the growing demand for luxury taxi services for entertainment and protocol use. dkkim@yna.co.kr • Report and inquiry (click!) ▶ After resisting the decision to collect the latest trends, National Intelligence Service Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Economy Lee Kyung-hwan (Supreme Public Prosecutors ' Office) was questioned three times by prosecutors on charges of paying bribes. 2017.12.6uwg806@yna.co.kr( : Seoul, Yonhap News Agency) godonguk banghyeondeok Journalist : National Intelligence Service said that the money from Park Geun-hye government minister of finance and deputy prime minister 100 million won.Korea Party lawmaker Choi Gyeong-hwan, Liberty engulfed in allegations that 6th at the prosecution.

When I met the reporters before I went to the investigating room and asked them, "" Don't you acknowledge the charge? "" And "" Did you ever say you had a hundred million won? "" I will tell the truth. I will justify the injustice. Choi is accused of receiving 100 million won in special activity fees from the NIS in 2014 when he was deputy prime minister and minister of finance. Prosecutors investigating the alleged bribery by the NIS, approved the petition by former NIS chief Lee Byung-kee to give Rep. Lee Heon-soo to the committee to hand over 100 million won to Choi. It is known that the NIS chose Choi as the right person to help the lawmakers of the opposition parties to respond to the special expenses, making an issue of the special expenses, in the process of reviewing the budget. Prosecutors believe the NIS gave special housing expenses as a kind of lobby concept to a head of the government who has the authority to organize the budget, hoping for a budget favor, thus being a bribe with some kind of payment. Prosecutors secured evidence by searching Choe`s home on July 20, the office of the National Assembly House in Yeouido, Seoul, and the office of Gyeongsan, North Gyeongsang Province. Choi was summoned on July 28, but was postponed three times until his appearance was actually confirmed.

Prosecutors accepted this request and scheduled a summons for July 5, but this time, they sent their intent to vote on the National Assembly's budget bill and attended the prosecutors ' meeting on the day it was delayed. Choi strongly denies the charges, saying he has never received any bribes from the NIS. I apologize for causing concern to the public over this incident, Choi said during his appearance.

Google has so far joined forces with Amazon to allow YouTube to play, but it warned of conflicts when its ecosystem abruptly blocked YouTube in September. Since the Echo series, an AI speaker, has a screen on it, blocking YouTube could be fatal. The break in the symbiotic relationship between the two companies is due to the break in the boundaries of their hardware, software and contents in the IT business, the relationship between the two is gradually shifting from being a partner to a competitor. Google recently launched the latest version of its AI speaker Google Home, setting out to capture the hardware market. If Google strengthens its AI speakers, it is less necessary to rely on Amazon speakers.

The Monetary Policy Committee raised the key interest rate by 0.25 % to 1.50 % from 1.25 %. [Yonhap] -- Did you think it was the right time for the Bank of Korea to raise rates? As for the currency policies of ▲ (Kim Hyun-wook, Kim), it is necessary to maintain the relaxed policy lines while the Korean economy is still unstable. "" When judging from the macroeconomic indicators, I wonder if it was too early to raise the index. There has been no sign of an upward tendency in price hikes and a significant concentration of economic improvement, and future changes in external environment, especially semiconductor cycle, could sway our economy. -- It is hard to say that the Maginot Line is easy, as it called for a flexible monetary policy, at the rate of ▲ (Kim). The fact that prices are still at a low level at the current interest rate makes us believe that there is more than enough room to cut rates. However, since the BOK has a financial stabilization goal in addition to the price stabilization goal, it will explain the specific effects of the financial stability when it has an intention to achieve it in the future. - What do you think will happen next year in the semiconductor business? ▲ (Kim) There is half the view that the semiconductor boom will continue, and that the semiconductor boom will break in the second half of next year. IMF and others are judged to have calculated growth rates in Korea based on their optimism about the semiconductor business. Overall, the phase of the semiconductor demand exceeding supply continues at least until next year, but the neutral view is that semiconductor prices and demand will not grow as fast as this year. - Government policies, such as income driven growth, will contribute to the growth of consumption, and by eliminating their effects, the growth forecast for next year will be around 2.4 % to 2.5 %. Without the policy effect, the growth rate of consumption will be similar to this year's. -- Bad youth employment. ▲ (Kim) The construction industry accounts for one of the major areas of growth, and the fact that the mid-year-olds are employed more than young people and semiconductors, the center of manufacturing, did not cause job creation very much. Employment for the young has not worsened significantly this year, but as the number of young people who have applied for jobs increases little by little, the number of economically active Koreans who have jobs will have moved on. sewonlee@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"

Seoul = Choi Soon-ah, a reporter at the Central District Court held in Seoul on July 6 and ordered the court to sponsor the Seoul Youth Center for Sports Genius (Chung-su) 2017.12.06. bluesoda@newsis.com Court ruled that "" the highest gains were made from the Center for the gifted and talented "" and "" Consider the charge of the crime committed by the special prosecutor Choi Soon-sil (27 billion won or more as cooperation between prosecutors ' office and independent counsel). "" Contrary to popular belief that Chang will be sentenced to a lower sentence for his contributions, the court judges found that Chang received a large amount of profit from being forced to sponsor the Center for Winter Sports. The Seoul Central District Court held Chang in jail for two and a half years for obstructing the right to abuse his authority on July 6. Jang is expected to actively cooperate with the investigation or the trial to get a lower sentence than other defendants in state affairs. Some say Jang's confession of most of the crimes is also advantageous. Chang is an independent counsel and help secure Mr. Choi's second tablet pc, Park Geun-hye (65) former president under other cell phone number to recall the great help in its investigation as ' an independent counsel.Boktteongi ',' special helper ' called. However, the court judged that Jang had the most benefit from running the center and had to face a jail sentence as the crime cost exceeded 2 billion won. Chang was Choi's influence and Park knows better than anyone about her relationship with the former president, and their subsidiary Samsung and Korean National Tourism Organization use its influence.He points out that under the total in more than $ 1.8 billion at the Grand Korea Leisure (gkl) donations. In addition, he admitted that he was guilty of operating the center in real terms and diverting 300 million won from the center's financing company under a borrowed name. The ministry also judged that it was intentional to steal about 240 million won worth of subsidies from the ministry as fake business plans. Even though the center was established to promote Choi's private interests in the long run, Jang's financial management at the time of the crime was at a disadvantage.Choi Soon-sil's niece, Jang Si-ho, is in Seoul for the first hearing on the "" National Agricultural Cooperative Federation Case "" at the Central District Court in Seoul Monday. 2017.12.06. mangusta@newsis.com The court plea for a variety of reasons, "" Chang before the president abused his authority of the centers for gifted children know to be used for funding pressure and business plan.Choi gave. ""and"" and center staff to make corporate officials met with donations to fill to discuss the payment procedures, such as an important role in the crime.Responsible, pointed out. The person who gained the most from the crimes was Chang Jang-jang, who actually ran the Center for the gifted and managed fund management at the time, said the government official, who was forced to pay two billion won in bribes. In the end, the prosecution has sentenced Jang to a relatively low sentence of 1-12 months for cooperating with the investigation and helping to establish his identity, but the court ruled that Jang's offense was guilty of excessive. Earlier, the prosecution held on August 8, Chang's restraint in the final trial "" Choe and former president's private Park in the process of investigation or on trial after stating in great detail the relationship, etc.Really active participation in the investigation, older to explain why. Chang is also the only defendant in a state affairs scandal who has not received a warrant for additional arrest. However, Jang's merits may have helped to set the jail sentence, forcing him to avoid heavier jail time. We actively cooperated with the probe by not only investigating the special prosecution and the prosecution to find out whether they belong to the case, the court said, taking into consideration the favorable circumstances. In the end, the court judged that Jang was guilty of being sentenced to as much as the prosecution's sentence, but given Chang's contributions, he sentenced to a lesser sentence than the middle class. hey1@newsis.comAfter a bout of heavy snow and rain in the middle of the way to work, it is much easier to get active today.

"Dear Jidinet Korea : Do you think our mobile phone rates are too high? Why not? About was the president is a household communication service fee cut pledges. Then, how much should it be? Moon Jae-in but you remember most of the president's promise, abolish subscription fees. And I think they've estimated the basic cost at about 11,000 won (which is now a non-existing item). Let me tell you about that number.How much would it cost to reduce each person by 11,000 won? If you multiply by 55 million subscribers, and then multiply by 12 months, you'll see that. That's about 7.28 trillion won. Can you feel how much it costs? Last year, the total operating profit of the three telecom companies was 3.6 trillion won. It's only twice as much as that. So if nothing changes and you suddenly cut down 11,000 won, three telecom companies will lose 3.6 trillion won overnight.I don't think your readers would want to go that far. President is no less. So if you want to lower your rate by 11,000 won, you have to find another way. And that's how telcos can get the right profit and consumers can get the right rate. So the first way to think about it is to reduce the cost of nothing. What is it? Wouldn't it be all right to weigh the carrier's cost?Carrier costs are largely divided into marketing, facility investment, and labor. Since labor costs are relatively small, it is safe to say that there is little to come back to the consumer. Since facility investment is directly related to service quality and could have a catastrophic influence on the entire ecosystem of the communication service industry, it is not easy to handle the investment. Eventually, all you have left is marketing money. So, what is that marketing cost?There are also three main things : Ad security, terminal support, distribution network operating costs, and more. The promotional fee for dual ads is small, so it can safely be taken for granted that they don't amount to anything for consumers. So we have to reduce the subsidy and the distribution costs. The subsidy money is to go to the consumers anyway, so it's just a tax collector. So the only way to reduce that back to the consumers is to pay for distribution.But do you know the full name of the single law that most consumers are pointing fingers at? This is the Act on Distribution and Construction Line of Terminal Services. Do you have a hunch? Yeah. It's meant to restructure an overly large distribution network. However, it seems that it was intended to be natural for them to restructure the small business owners so severely. They thought that if they cooled the market, the retailers would give it to them a little bit of voluntarily.I think this is well reflected. The number of retail outlets has decreased considerably. Recently, the legislature also released a report that the law had a positive effect on consumers. Because they reduced consumer discrimination through subsidy notice and especially by introducing a discount system, they don't have to purchase a new terminal for a long time. They can get a discount equivalent to the length of the terminal.Distribution structures are improving little by little, and consumer benefits are rising little by little, but most consumers don't seem to feel this. Change is so slow. And it's time for a semi-revolutionary. I think it's a request to change it noticeably. There is no need for additional effects such as introducing a separate public trial system or revising the law. I think being a fully self-supplying drug will make a difference and have a huge effect on me.That's right. Could be. The problem is whether the net function of effects is great or the adverse effects are noticeable. But did you know that there is actually the same meaning of perfect self-sufficiency or a single method? They both want to improve distribution. But the latter is to take things slowly for fear of adverse effects, and the former is to be finished only once. Who's the victim here? Yeah. It's a lifestyle store that consumers are accusing of being a Pontfale.Now, let's reconsider it. How to raise funds of 7.28 trillion won to reduce revenues by 11,000 won per subscriber. How many distribution points do you want? But before that, what would a carrier ask you to pay out of its 3.6 trillion won operating profit? Would about two trillion won satisfy you? Moreover, if the subsidy is around 130,000 won per year with 15 million units, it is about 2 trillion won. So we need to get rid of 3.2 trillion won.That's right. That's a rough estimate, but if you want to lower your rates by 11,000 won per person, either fully self-contained or under the law, you can cut down three telecom companies ' profits by half, and you can get a flat discount. But would you do this in a place called the Council of Household Communications Expenses that was established for social consensus? Isn't it so strange to read it again?That's right. Discussion in this way is a change in the course of events. It's a retail price, whether it's a mobile phone or a terminal fee. It's a funny way to determine the retail price of a private product. A lower retail price is only a side-effect when competition is encouraged through industrial restructuring. It's a product of promoting fair competition. The only thing that's forcing you to control prices is Procrustes ' bed.You have to force someone to cut off their ankle. So is it really desirable for a society to suddenly make a scapegoat of someone? The goal of restructuring is to have two purposes. It's about boosting the competitiveness of the industry and bringing benefits to consumers as a result of the competition. Revolutionizing the structure, with the benefits set for the consumer ahead of time, is a reversal and could potentially distort the industry.I hope that the Council of Household Communications Expenses will consider this.Lee Jung-seong, editor-in-chief of Tae-Chang Elementary School, (sereno@zdnet.co.kr) and Naver Channel's "" Jidinet Korea "" is now available. The Chinese government is pushing for a policy to convert coal heating, one of the main contaminants in the north, into a gas or electric heating system, according to the newspaper. This year, more than 3 million households in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hubei provinces had gas heating installed, and banned the sale or use of coal heating appliances. The drastic action, called "" smog hell, "" to improve China's serious air pollution has led to a severe shortage of liquefied natural gas (LNG). In northern China, households in Shanxi, Henan, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, where households are often supplied with frozen homes, are affected by the cold. In some areas, the government has taken down coal heating appliances unilaterally, but since no gas or electric heating facilities have yet been installed, there is no means of heating the plant at all. Several elementary schools in Baoding, Hubei Province have also dismantled their coal stoves, but no gas heating system has been installed yet. Because of this, students are studying out of a cold classroom and placing their desks in a sunny playground. Some students are warming up while running. One parent said, We have been supplying gas for nearly 20 days and no gas heating has been installed in several elementary schools. "" It is winter time when the big snow is sunny and the students are able to feel the warmth of the playground, but we are teaching in the playground even though it is the winter season, "" one elementary school principal said. Due to the situation, frostbite patients are occurring among elementary school students in the area. `` It's so sad to see a child get frostbite, broken-heeled and cracked heels, '' said a mother of an elementary school student in Nanyawar. As a result, we will have all of the relevant facilities ready by night, said Rep. Cho Yang-hyun, Communist Party secretary, adding, We will have no gas heating or electricity at our current elementary schools. However, some schools in the region are reportedly going to use coal heaters as they can not afford to install them for the time being. ssahn@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"

First of all, I excluded famous places. They removed any known campgrounds or beaches from the list. They also avoided the bathroom or close to the water's edge.

Whether at night or in the early morning, it is very attractive to be able to leave without much preparation, carrying a simple camping outfit in your car. Because you are alone, you can eat rice or make do with instant food. It is good to be able to focus on yourself without spending a lot of money and not have to time on others.

It has also received appearances from television stations as a "" survival expert, "" who can endure days of least equipment on uninhabited islands or rough mountainous terrain.Kwak's attraction to camping on his own was in the summer of 2005. `` I worked in a distribution shop in Seoul then.He chose Kazodo, an island in Geoje, as the most memorable camping site. Although they had to walk down the slope for more than two hours to find a place to stay with a backpack weighing more than 30kg, the picturesque scenery at the bottom of the cliff helped them relieve their hardship. If you shave your own bamboo and make chopsticks and drink, and prepare your own recipes such as Tojongguk Ramyeon and Topokki, you can have a lot of sour play, he said. Three years ago, I sometimes had a dizzy time on Kazodo alone when I was hit by a typhoon, but in a way, it`s still fun for Solcama, Kwak said with a smile.Many of his deserted islets, including Shinan in South Jeolla Province, are also his favorite. "" If you set up a tent in the middle of a vast ocean and you see islands floating like a dot, you have no one else in the movie. They're leisurely asking for sleep, and as they walk along the mudflat, the whole island becomes a "" house of their own. "" "" If you want to sleep, "" a camping veteran says, "" If you want to sleep, "" and "" you want to sleep. The cost of traveling alone is also his chief merit.After all, the biggest attraction is the healing power : "" The time you focus on yourself for a while with your headache at work and personal relationships turned out to be Kwak's energy to endure in your daily routine. "" Solcam is a gift of healing for the tired.Camping enthusiasts say "" Solcama is the time to find true me in nature. "" Camping specialist Kim Seok-woo is provided at Jeju tamla@hankookilbo.com"
"Space researcher Dr. Marco Lambrook, who has been tracing North Korea`s missile program, said on CNN yesterday that he discovered that the direction in which the photograph was taken was inconsistent with the constellations. The direction of the photo shoot is based on the shape of the column of smoke coming from the missile engines. Dr. Lambroke showed two of North Korea's published photographs, saying, "" I could tell you by the fact that two pictures were taken in the same direction, but the background was completely different. "" One picture had another Orion in the southeast. `` The images of the constellations on the other side were large with Orion in the south-southeast (captured in the same direction) and. '' However, he added that the dog Star was missing in the photo based on the large dog site. In Germany continue public and then a picture them 30 days North Korea last month after this analysis operation would be staged in cnn said. When taking star pictures, photographers usually use the ' long exposure ' mode to capture more light, which is why missile movements are blurred. When taking pictures of a missile during the night, the diaphragm is wide open and presses on the fast shutter to capture the missile's fast launching, which makes it hard for even low-contamination North Korea to make clear. Dr. Jonathan McDowell of the Havard-Smith Institute of Astrophysics and Astrophysics told CNN, "" It was strange that the images were so clear. "" However, Dr. Lambrook said, "" It's not as if I've touched every picture, "" citing the picture of ' Hwason-15 ' before the launch. A blurry photo of a star on a background screen and a person was caught in the lower right corner of an ICP---the fact that the "" strip of bare earth "" missile was used to capture the night sky shows a clear background photo of Mars 15. It also said the photo manipulation could disrupt researchers of the North Korean missile program. When tested in broad daylight, a background screen can help determine where and what missile was launched. But the night time is different. Dr. McDowell told CNN : It is not easy to believe that the star was launched from Pyeongseong, north of Pyongyang, because it does not seem to be different even if it was a few miles away. U.S. missile specialist Jeffrey Lewis Miedberry at the Center for International Studies, said, We will work on using Forensick software to lighten those photographs. `` Because there is no evidence that the picture of the missile itself has been altered, I think we have done something to make it look more attractive against the stars, '' he said.North Korea has doubled its thrust (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) to produce a two-stage, coast-to-coast nuclear missile (ICP-15), which was launched on July 29.

"[Hankyoreh] When the left and right turns were higher than the effects of a certain rotation speed, the maximum close relative to the maximum rolling speed was reached. When the alignment of the cylinders (left) filled with 25,000 cubes (left) was not repeated, they were completely changed. Place the PRL provided cube of 25,000 small dice violently in a bowl. How can you arrange the dice neatly to the maximum density while reducing the waste of space between the dice? A common method is tapping the bowl to pack the dice in small chunks. Even in our daily lives, when we add sugar to our dishes, we tap or shake them slightly when they are about to overflow. Then the sugar grains are packed together as they reduce their small spaces, so they can fill up a little more. Physicists ' latest experiment shows that the faster-filled grains can be stacked in order to fill rather than tapping or shaking the plates, spinning them up and down more efficiently. Physicists at the University of Navarra in Spain have recently found an experiment in the journal Physical Review Letters (PRL) to find out the maximum concentration of particle material in a paper. They saw that the maximum number of cubes they could see would be stacked as they rounded up to a higher speed of 8.7 cm in diameter, which was roughly equal to 25,000 cubes, one half centimeters long and one half high. The researchers repeatedly turned the cylinder with dice to the left once a second, then suddenly stopped and turned right again. After several tens of thousands of turns, the 25,000 mixed dice had been layered and tightly aligned with concentric arrangements on each layer. The dice had a force (shearing force) on the outside of the cylinder when it was rotating, and as it suddenly changed direction of rotation, the dice ' pools gradually aligned in a plane. ▷ When rotating horizontally above a certain speed of https://physics.aps.org/articles/v10/130 the cube dice were in perfect alignment with concentric circles (left). If the rotation speed was slow, it could not reach full alignment. Can this be used in PRL delivered everyday life? It is hard for us to implement the experimental conditions by ourselves. In their experiment, the dice reached their alignment when they made tens of thousands of turns left and right. In addition, a constant turnover was important. Such effects were only obtained relatively quickly when the rotational speed was higher than a certain level. According to a report by the American Physical Society online media, the method is the same, but when it comes to spinning at a slower rate, the dice are ' one day too long, ' but it may take too long to get to fully aligned. The researchers said the maximum tight alignment was reached by 10,000 rotations when the rotational acceleration was greater than 0.5g (here g is in gravity acceleration), but if less than that, alignment would be insufficient after 100,000 rotations. In the paper, the researchers said, "" It is difficult to say whether we can reach maximum density at such low intensity levels. But when looking at the cases identified in our experiments, we can expand and deduce on the basis of observations (i.e., linear extrapolation) that "" it takes us 10 years to get to that point in time. "" On the other hand, they added that the method of getting gravity to reduce the empty space by tapping or waving a bowl is not "" at its maximum density "", no matter how many times. The method of packing particles in a dense state is used for storing and packaging in the industry. The researchers expected that rotation of the left and right sides could lead to particle alignment and maximum density, unlike the commonly used tapping method. Researchers also believe that with the help of rotational power, it can be utilized in a gravitational free space space, so they perform similar experiments at the International Space Station (ISS), where gravity is desired.

Korean Air Force Villances to Fly Over the Korean Peninsula Combined Air Force Praise.com Participated in Air Drill Team Korea - U.S. Air Force Force......With stealth fighter jet fighter jet fighter Lee Young-jae, U.S. long-range strategy fighter jet B-1B was launched Thursday. The joint chiefs of staff said yesterday, Combined Air Force conducted a joint simulated bombing exercise today with a U.S. Air Force B-1b fighter jet from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. One B-1b and 16 U.S. Air Force fighter jets, along with two F-35A jets, Korean Air Force fighters and Vigilant ACE fighters, participated in a combined air training exercise with the United States and the United States.It is the first time that U.S. strategic weapons B-1b and F-22 Raptors, deployed simultaneously over the Korean Peninsula in October, to conduct bombing exercises. In the exercise, B-1b's simulated drive-offs, and our two F-15Ks were shot to death by an MK - 82. - 1 b b Pil Sung Range in Gangwon Province in the East Sea into the air over militant reportedly out of East Sea into the air bombing drill again. The drill, which was conducted in time for the large-scale Korea-U.S. Combined Air Force exercise, was carried out as part of a regular deployment exercise to enhance the ability to control expansion, the JCS explained.U.S. Air Force Force-Korea Joint Air Force Armament Vigilant Ace 2, Korean Air Force Base, Korean Air Force Base, 19-5 "" Through this training exercise, the R.O.K. Air Force demonstrated its strong will and ability to punish the allies for North Korea's nuclear and missile threats, and mastered the interoperability of combined forces before and during peacetime. ""The non-selective ace training, which began on July 4, includes more than 230 U.S. strategic fighter jets, including the U.S. Air Force's F-22s. Including F-35A and F-35B, there are 24 U.S. Air Force stealth fighters participating in the training. North Korea is expected to feel the most pressure as its strategic weaponry B-1b is participating in the exercise. - 1 b b the skies over the Korean peninsula, U.S. visit ahead of the president is Donald Trump last month previously. The B-1b, nicknamed the ' death swan ' for its shape, is equipped with three American strategic bombers with B-52strato Fortress and B-2 Spirit of processing power. The maximum payload is more than B-522 and B-2, making it 34 tons inside the fuselage and 27 tons outside, including wings. A single launch can drop a large bomb. As the maximum speed is Mach 1.2, B-52`s B-2 (957 km/h) and B-2 (Mach 0.9), it can take off from Guam base and operate on the Korean Peninsula in two hours. It is considered to be an optimal bomber for throwing bombs and flying enemy fighters at high speed. The two air forces will continue to show their ability to control the combined forces of the United States and Japan through joint training with strategic bombers and continue to improve their combined operations to respond swiftly in the event of an emergency, the office said. ljglory@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
