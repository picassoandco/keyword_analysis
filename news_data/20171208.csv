The successor will be put into temporary service for the time being.From now on, I think I will probably get off at the ` news desk `. "" But it is true that we are on the way out, "" said the news directors. "" We have a meeting to discuss the fate of Bae Hyun-jin, and we are discussing his replacement. Bae Hyun-jin, an anchor of the Korean union, said, "" As the president is replaced after the end of the strike, the TV industry has been closely watching TV, Chosun, and Lee Jik-seong. There was no discussion, television Chosun said, adding, "" There is no discussion.Bae Hyun-jin, who joined MBC in 2008, has been hosting a news desk since 2010. It is the longest running record for ' Newsshop ' since MBC announcer Baek Ji-yeon's 8-year history.Although he kept his ' news desk ' post after moving from announcer to anchor, he was harshly criticized by the public after stories behind his scenes, such as conflicts with colleagues, were revealed during the strike.

"From the anchor of the program's main journalist to the producer of MBC's "" Discontinuance, "" then the producer of "" The Independent Media, "" and recently, "" Confession, "" and "" The accomplice, "" have received a lot of support. PD Choi Seung-ho was officially appointed as the new president of MBC after a shareholders ' meeting at the Korea Broadcasting Foundation yesterday. Today is my first day of work since I was fired. But you're going to be returning to work as president. Let's connect with Choi Seung-ho, the new president of MBC. Hello, Mr. Choi Seung-ho. How are you? ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : Is the title of president okay? It is awkward (laughter). ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Congratulations. Thank you very much. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > I don't know if I slept at night yesterday. ^ Choiseungho ^ yes. I slept. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : Who is your favorite person? First, I could not answer that many people called and welcomed me. But my mom loved it the most, too, and that was the best part. She loved it. What do you like doing, saying that's Kim Hyun-jung? And my father died in the meantime. When I told you that I was going to take my boss and that to a public offering, I don't think you took it so seriously. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung (laugh) = (laugh) must be able to do so. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > How good it would be to do so, how long? How do you feel about being the president and going to work today? Choi Seung-ho, the new president of MBC (Lee Han-hyeong, a journalist, and a file photo). So, we will do our best to make MBC culture broadcast to reward the people once again. Kim Hyun-jung > So Seollem is Seollem now, but you should worry more. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > So, if it is 1997, it would be 2000 days after tomorrow, Mr.Choi, since I will be restored to work in 2,000 days. Have you ever imagined that I would be the president of MBC and go back? ^ Choiseungho > never. I didn't live with the idea of being the boss. I always enjoyed doing the program and thought it was my vocation, but it turned out. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I heard that you worried a lot about yourself. But why did you decide to do it, what made you decide? I felt strongly that I wanted it from the members of MBC and my juniors. It is meaningful that when you are fired and keep trying to recover the broadcasting, you will have some sort of symbolic meaning, so you can get some support and support from the people. That's how I felt I had a role to play. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I see. This is a shameful comment, as the public said, ' It's quite a mess. I don't know what my past reputation was. ' MBC's top priority. What do you think is your first priority? First of all, I think it is most important to regain the trust of the people. Set the news straight, the news programs straight. So, I think MBC should be able to get its act together in a relatively short time, rather than in the way it used to be. ◇ Isn't this important work also for you to do in personnel reform? What do you think about that part? First of all, you can say hello. For those who are responsible for various cases of abuse of authority, corruption, or corruption, MBC Reconstruction Committee is designated as a tentatively named name. We should deal with the problem, investigate it, and call it a joint labor-management committee. "" I will make a new organization like Kim Hyun-jung > MBC Reconstruction Committee and do a lot of work through it. Because I think this question has come up the most, perhaps, because it has become perceived by the public like a symbol of MBC's past, a symbol of conflict. Bae Hyun-jin, announcer of MBC, Shin Dong-ho. What do you think of their attitude? Choi Seung-ho : I think first of all, Sindong-ho announcer is responsible for keeping 11 MBC faces from the Anaunseo country from leaving, and I let 11 announcer who are found to be doing something unfair. So he says, in our opinion, the company has no choice but to go through the proper procedures, thoroughly investigate and take responsibility for it. Bae Hyun-jin is now the anchor, and I think that's where the news bureau will probably come up with a new anchor system. Are you saying that you are changing the anchor as a new anchor system? I think it is probably planned at the news bureau. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Actually, the internal conflict was serious. So, when I met with people from MBC, they were complaining. It may be easier to raise the quality of the programmes and raise the viewing rates. Tell them from the inside that it may be possible to resolve conflicts within the organization and consolidate the disjointed organizations into one. Some were cut off, some were banished, and there are still people who sent them. You said, "" It is a conflict that is like in a space and we don't greet each other. "" How are you going to handle this? I think it is a problem to approach and solve one or more minds with sincerity as the representative of the organization. As organizations reach out, the executives blame, apologize, and believe they need to go ahead and do the same. And I think in the process, you can do a little bit of a lump or something. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : If you blame the wrong people and they apologize or have anything to do, you need to take care of it. ^ Choiseungho > yes. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : What you said about the reconstruction committee would be a very important organization. ^ Choiseungho ^ yes. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Choi Seung-ho, the new president of MBC, is meeting with me now. Boss, it's a nice day today. Do not call me the president. (Laughing) It's pretty awkward. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > (laugh) sounds a little strange to me, but he is the president now. Chief Executive Choi Seung-ho, I'm sorry for the heavy questions I have on today when I feel good. ^ the final winner is good. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > What else I want to say is that in today's article, all three terrestrial TV stations received the lowest re-licensing grade of 616 points among them. It's over 650 in the bag. Did you see that? I saw the article at the end of the movie. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung ; How do you intend to do this? Mr Choi : It is a fall due to past mistakes made by management. We quickly recover and trust in the committee. If you trust the people, wouldn't the commission consider it? I want you to believe that we need to start rebuilding, and that we will get better. Are you going to make the reconstruction organization as soon as you take office? ^ Choi Seung-ho > Yes, it should be. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : In the political arena, Commentations poured out yesterday, immediately after the birth of Choi Seung-ho, the new president of the company. The comment of the Free Korea Party is rather chilly. New, labor-backed CEO Choi Seung-ho has taken control of the MBC office. MBC has become a full performance broadcast of Noh Young. The people will be watching fiercely to see if they will say "" fair "" or "" fair "" to the media and raise their viewing rates.' Comment. What would you say? Mr Choi : I shall not intervene in the reporting. It'll probably go up. But, I think naming it Noh Young is not a suitable word. MBC, the company, is characterized by its owner's sense of ownership. A company with no owners But, it is not even state-run, so it is too much to say in the name of Noyoung. Management has always made decisions on management. Labor unions served as a check on management when they went wrong. Of course, I want to make a program like this on the new MBC that you are coming back after becoming president. What kind of dream do you have? I want to try the public broadcasting program anyway. Dramas, entertainment, current culture, documentaries and radio. I think there should be a ' public broadcaster ' in all. It may be lower than these programs that are provocative and just focused on watching. It may fall a little, but. Shakily"
"I don't think you can lose. But I think we need to do a lot of these programs that have something that you can feel in them. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > That's a heavy answer. The current affairs bureau has been abolished. How do you intend to do this? Mr Choi : Of course the Sisa Department should be restored. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > should be restored. Focus on you, starting with the news before, we have to start with the news. That's where we start. ^ Choi Seung-ho > Yes, it is. ◇ I really expect much from MBC that producer Kim Hyun-jung > Choi Seung-ho to make as a president. I told you earlier that it would be too much of a burden, but I have to burden you more. I will do my best ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Congratulations. I need you to get to work quickly. ^ Choi Seung-ho >, thank you. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Thank you. ^ Choi Seung-ho > Yes, thank you. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Retire as president after 97 days. I was President Choi Seung-ho in the first interview on his way to work today.

As a result, the former chief of the district public prosecutor will avoid the disgrace of being in violation of the law, which prohibits people from asking for favors.

"▽ Price collapse due to increased production, market quarantine measures … Waste is 99 % of Jeonnam Mountain (Yeongam = Yonhap News Agency) : `` I think it would be better if I cut myself open and felt better. A breast-chested picture "" Daebong-gam (Yeongam = Yonhap News Agency) "" Park Cheol-hong : A market quarantine is in effect at one hundred Daebong-dong farms in Yeongam, South Jeolla Province. 2017.12.8 A good harvest should be sounded with music, but this year's great harvest brought tears to the farmers. Yeongam County of South Jeolla Province visited Friday last day to dispose of the blocked shopping district due to a sharp decline in prices due to an increase in the yield of large bags. A hundred deep valleys along the foot of a mountain valley in Geumjeong-myeon, Yeongam-gun were filled with broken branches that had not yet been harvested. The snow fell in the bleak winter, when I looked closely at the great peaks of the hills embroidered with numerous red dots, and the harvest season was falling down to a pulp.Yang Deok-rye (72, female), who has been farming with the trees for more than 10 years, handed out 29 boxes of the bamboo cane that he harvested with his son. Then, he threw a whole box of healthy fruit juice into the field. Yang's son thumped his way through a winding machine scattered across the floor. Yang turned his head as if he could not see it, and tied the dry branches off his shoulders. Yang collected 20 kilograms and 120 boxes of straw bags this year. Only 29 cases, or 20 percent, of which can receive a government reward of 15,000 won per person for disposing of the mountain ranges. It is because only about 23 percent of the compensation requests for farmers to dispose of the land will be accepted in accordance with the government budget. Even though they can harvest the remaining persimmons, they can not pick up the labor costs and the cost of the box, said the farmers who gave up during the year. The nearby farmers dug their way through the earth to dispose of 300 cases of bamboo. The farm produces around 1,200 boxes of harvest but can not sell most. At the end of last month, the price of a large bag was traded at 9,818 won per box (10 kg) based on the wholesale market of agricultural products in Garak-dong, Seoul. The price of the products decreased 29 percent from last year and 17 percent from the same time last year.The National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (Nonghyup), which has disposed of the lump sum of iron, which is being thrown into a hole for the first time, is also suffering from difficulties because it has no sharp measures but to isolate the market. As the price of large rice bags falls, the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (Nonghyup) has come up with measures to stabilize supply and demand for large corporations. Among the products shipped from the producers ' farms, some 2,000 tons will be cut off, but excluding some 10 tons from Gyeongnam, the wholesale market will be divided into those from the area. Among the 2,300 tons, 1,400 tons is commercialized into persimmons, and 90 tons are donated to underprivileged people. The remaining 810 tons are purchased from farms and will be disposed of at 4,500 won per kilogram. Jungjin said, "" There was no typhoon, abnormal climate, insect pests, or drought damage! Thanks to the summer heat wave, the crop was in good shape "" and added, "" The price of Daebong was decreased due to the high production volume. """
"[Hankyoreh] [Health Story of Middle School] There are many myths about hair loss, the real symptoms of hair loss, and the likely myths about hair loss. It is not a case of taking away the life or suffering, but it is of interest to many people. In particular, the "" secret recipe "" for hair loss has spread recently through social networking services such as Facebook. One treatment is that if a person beats a person's hair out with a comb shaped device, his or her hair will go bald within a few weeks. A related specialist believes a scalp massage that gently presses down on the hair loss area can help blood circulation and alleviate the symptoms of hair loss, but points out that there is no clear medical evidence involved. Many doctors add that rather than accepting many myths about hair loss without filtering, it is advisable to consult a specialist and choose the appropriate treatment. Scalp massage, hair growth, shampoo, black food, hair loss treatment is not medically based and falls due to hat, hair color, perms, or acid rain.Just a myth … ' Before the World Cup, ' not to prove it, women's hair loss can be improved into dermatologist treatments because it is different from men. If blood circulation improves through scalp massage, more nutrients can be transferred to the hair, which can help improve hair loss. Doctors do not question the fact that blood circulation is smooth through scalp massage. The problem is that the act has not been medically verified yet to see how it can help cure hair loss. Lee Sang-jun, director of the beautiful skin care department at Kangnam, said, Although tapping the scalp is believed to temporarily stimulate blood vessels in the scalp, medical science has no evidence of hair loss through scalp massage. Rather, there is a possibility of side effects : tapping the scalp with a sharp comb or fingernail can damage weak scalp and cause inflammation. In order to have a scalp massage, apply a gentle pressure to the fingerprint area of the fingertips, not to a sharp nail, comb, or device. One of the most popular things with scalp massage is that shampoo helps you lose your hair. Shampoo for hair loss helps to provide nourishment or keep hair's skin clean. In case of hair loss due to bacteria that have invaded the skin of the head, hair loss can be caused by shampoo. However, it is unreasonable to expect a hair growth effect by fundamentally eliminating the cause of hair loss. To avoid worsening hair loss, wash your hair and dry it thoroughly before keeping your scalp clean. It is said that washing your hair too often will worsen your hair loss, but the fact is, when you close your hair, your hair falls out when it reaches its end of life. Be aware that 50 to 100 hairs are normally lost every day without hair loss, and if you do not detect them often, your scalp may get dirty and greasy and hair loss can worsen. If you wear a hat, your hair will fall out. If the cap is not tight enough to stop blood circulation, wearing it usually does not cause hair loss. Hats play a beneficial role in the scalp, which protects the scalp from ultraviolet rays. However, during the summer when it is easy to use and sweaty, choose a hat that can breathe easily. It should be noted that wearing a hat too long can cause the scalp to sweat or the scalp to cool, resulting in a high level of bacteria that reproduce on the scalp. There are also rumors that frequent dyeing or perms cause hair loss, but this is not true either. Dyeing or permanent hair permanent inflammation in the scalp due to subtle hair damage does not cause hair loss. - Black food heals hair loss? - It is said that eating lots of black food such as black bean can cure hair loss. To begin with, it may help your scalp and hair health, but it is not effective in treating hair loss. Beans contain many antioxidants, including isoflorate, polyphenols, and these components can help you stay healthy. However, it is not advisable to restore the hair loss that has already occurred, so it is not advisable to trust only black beans to eat them. Of course, it is only a myth that eating black foods can help prevent hair from turning white or even hair loss. It is also said that acid rain causes hair loss. Medically, that is not true. Generally, below PH6.6, acid rain is considered to be weaker than normal shampoo. Due to acid rain, hair loss is unlikely, and harmful substances, such as fine dust, contained in rain can irritate the scalp and worsen hair loss. - Hair loss is the exclusive property of men? - When you do it, it usually reminds you of men. This is especially true because hair loss is caused by male hormone androgen. However, androgens are produced not only in men but also in women in the ovary and adrenal glands. The concentration is about half that of men. This can cause hair loss in women. However, it is different from that of men. Men's hair loss begins from the bangs or the forehead, while women's hair tapered and decreased in the forehead area while maintaining the forehead lines. Men are also highlighted for their hair loss on the bangs and the top, but women are not completely bald as men. Many women actually visit hospitals to get hair loss treatment, and according to the National Health Insurance Corporation data, about 212,000 women were treated for hair loss last year, of which 94,000 women were treated. ■ Hair loss is considered to be before the age of two, and many believe it to be "" before the age of two, "" except for the age of three. In reality, hair loss often has a family history. However, the genetic principles and patterns of hair loss are not clear. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that one is inherited by the other. Even if both parents insist on losing their hair, their children may not. In contrast, some children have hair loss even though their parents do not. In addition, the pattern of hair loss is different, so fathers may look terrible on their children, even if it is not severe. Hair loss can be improved with precise diagnosis and treatment by a dermatologist. There are medicines to take and of course to apply. In case of taking medicine, you need to take it for at least three months to cure hair loss.

"Since the Paris Bagette Union's "" Workers ' Status Report "" failed to fulfill its order to hire workers, five thousand workers at the National Chemical Textile Industry Workers ' Union in Seoul held an overdue wage extension with their employers. Paris Bagette, a reporter at Bac, failed to follow the Employment and Labor Ministry's instructions to directly hire a partner company, and 70 people have filed a lawsuit against Paris Bagette. It follows that the Paris Baguette does not carry out the corrective instructions of the Department. The Paris Bagette Company, a union of seven hundred bakery partners, filed a suit with the Seoul Central District Court Friday to confirm the status of its workers. The lawsuit is made by 70 union members. As the union intends to file an additional lawsuit by collecting bread companies that want to participate in lawsuits in the future, the number of plaintiffs could grow. Some bakery companies sued for worker status because Paris Bargette had made it clear that it would reject direct payroll instructions. Regarding the background of the lawsuit, a union official said, "" The Paris Baguette court's responsibility was to explain to the union directly to the contrary, even though it made a profit from illegally distributed bread companies, by not even following government corrective instructions. "" The lawsuit, involving 70 bakery companies, is basically based on the results of Ko's supervision. The Department of Employment and Employment, citing the fact that Paris Bagette headquarters had directly directed its non-employment-related partner Zegette Company about employment law, said the Paris Bagette Company Head office dispatched workers. The ministry's direct employment adjustment of 5,000 bread machine operators came from this background. The union not only required the implementation of "" direct employment obligations, "" but also claimed the difference in wages with "" home-and-duty workers. "" Among Paris Bagette full-time workers, some 70 "" head office support articles "" work at franchises similar to bread machine operators. They have been baking at the bakery on the day the bakery was closed. They worked in conjunction with support articles from partner companies but received an additional 19-34 % in wage, depending on the number of workers who worked in a mix. Labor conditions, such as welfare benefits, were much better. The dispatch law requires the direct employment of dispatched workers in accordance with the conditions of their working class or similar work. According to the regulation, the court judged that if an illegal dispatch is granted, the difference between the wage paid as a dispatch worker and the wage that a regular worker should have received should have been increased. Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that Paris Bagette excluded "" Supporting Knight of the Head Office "" from its business as a member starting this month. "" We have taken corrective measures because of the comments that apply to the mix, "" said an official at Paris Baguette. In addition to the suits against employers, unions will file collective civil suits against delayed wages, such as overtime pay, which was not paid by suppliers. This is because some suppliers are not paying overtime. Park Tae-woo : Please be my best friend in the Hankyoreh!

From left, Ahn Joon-ho, chief of the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, National Police Agency Director Huh Kyung-ryul, Deputy Minister of Public Finance Kim Kyu-hong, Public Finance Minister Cho Kyu-hong, and Park Tae-Sung, public industry and commerce ministry supervisor, were found to have been caught. They are expected to face criminal responsibility, dismissal and dismissal. Even if the head of the institution is not directly involved in the recruitment scandal, public institutions that are caught with corruption in hiring will face disadvantages in assessing management. It can not help influencing the attitude of heads of public institutions in any way. The government held a meeting on August 8 under the supervision of Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance Kim Yong-jin and announced the results of an interim inspection into employment irregularities at public institutions. It is the result of a probe into the recruitment scandal conducted by 275 state-run organizations from Oct. 16 to Nov. 30.A total of 2,244 points were found. Various types of comments were detected, including lack of regulations and violation of recruitment notices. Out of the cases, 143 were reprimanded. A total of 44 cases, including 23 from the previous investigation and 21 confirmed from the tip, were requested to be investigated.There were many different types of recruitment irregularities. There were cases in which the head of the agency was involved. For example, it was revealed that the chief of a public institution, A, handed over the resume of his or her acquaintances ' children to HR officials, and instructed them to recruit. The employee was hired on a contract basis and was later transferred to full-time work.If the authorities thoroughly investigate the case, I will make a few points, since many suspected heads of the agency have been involved and most of the cases have been commissioned to be investigated, Kim said.The head of a specific agency involved in the recruitment scandal was kept secret. However, it is expected that they will be forced to fire if they are in the middle of an active career. The Act on the Management of a Public Institution provides that "" the Board of Directors may request the dismissal of an Director of an agency for any violation of any law or articles of association. ""Former head of the agency can not be free from responsibility, either.

The same is true for public institutions B where the careers of specific applicants are manipulated by the recruiting staff. These recruitment irregularities occurred this year ; according to the Public Service Management Evaluation Manual of 2017, when public institutions are subject to a rate of adjustment for the assessment or performance of any violation of their social responsibilities, such as employment discrimination.The assessment of the management of public institutions consists of six levels, and heads of public institutions of the lowest class, Class E, are subject to ask for dismissal. That is why public organizations and heads of organizations are expected to be hit hard as soon as the results of the recruitment scandal are revealed.The government will complete an inspection of the recruitment irregularities of 824 local government agencies and 272 other city-related agencies, which were not reflected in the interim results.

The two companies agreed to work together on technologies to improve energy efficiency, improve subway air quality, accidents and prevent crimes. One of the most notable projects of the joint research project is the open gate without tags. When a passenger carries a credit card or a transportation card through the ticket gate, the machine senses and charges the ticket. The Seoul Transportation Authority is studying and developing technologies to recognize only one card even if it has several cards in it.

"[Donga Ilbo] Elementary school student, Behind Tax - Taking a surprise look and posting it on social networking sites. I found it too hard to control my son…I thought my son was too nervous. A concerned look was apparent. Lee was surprised to hear that he had a hidden camera video. She looked for video clips using her smartphone with her trembling hands. There was a video titled "" Camera behind Mom's back. "" Lee, who had just washed his face in the bathroom, was shocked by his son's mischief. Lee said, It is not a strange video, but I was embarrassed to see my face floating around on the Internet. They say it is trendy, but I am afraid my child might even take pictures of others. Molmo Molka is in vogue among elementary school students these days. Of course, there is also ' daddy molka. ' But mostly the mother is the target. Most of the molka videos are of little tricks, such as pretending to be hurt, waking up a sleeping mother, and making a model out of waste paper needles in water, which suddenly appeared to parents. Some video clips are a little bit too "" deep "" to hit and run away from their mothers. Children post these images on their social networking sites and post them on YouTube and others. YouTube is a video that anyone can watch with a search. Most of them start out as children's games, but the parents are confused. This is because other people can access the video clip that contains all their personal lives. There is no way to confirm whether or not a child can take a picture by posting the video online without knowing when to take it. A parent (42, female) who was the subject of Molka said, "" It would be scary to think someone I didn't know could see at home looking comfortable. "" However, parents are very concerned about how much they should discipline and discipline their children. Parents responded, "" I don't know what to do when I can't watch my baby 24 hours a day. "" "" It's hard to be suspicious of my child. "" When I see a kid with a smartphone, I worry about whether or not he is taking me, said Kang (38.) Still, she said, "" I have a child safety and I can't take my smartphone away from my friends when I can be ostracized. "" The background of the Molka fad is also due to the popularity of the popular "" acquaintance of Molka "" on the Internet's personal broadcasting website. Molka is a model of her boyfriend who throws her into the water with his foot and shouts at her parents all of a sudden. The average number of video clips of ordinary people in Molka tops reached tens of thousands. Park, 37, has a fourth-grade son, who says, "" My baby watches ' ordinary people's Molka video ' every day on my smartphone. Regardless of the contents, Molka itself has an illegal side, and I`m afraid the baby may have the wrong perception.

The failure of all three terrestrial broadcasting companies to pass the basic scores is a symbolic result of the drop in the status of terrestrial broadcasters, and the Korea Communications Commission (KCC), which has the right to renew its license, will deal with this issue. In total, the Korean Broadcasting Commission (KCC) has recently reviewed re-licensing and renewal service boards, which scored 640 points or 647, or 650-466 points, and Korea Broadcasting System officials. < Culture Broadcasting > was reported to have received the lowest score of 616.

Both public and private broadcasters are said to have received low reviews in the review. It is the second time that private broadcaster, "" The Assessors >, "" has been placed on the brink of being eliminated.

"- 10:01 AM / by Josh LowensohnSo Premium China Foldable Smart Photoscopes.May smartphones that have been evaluated as ' no innovation ' in recent years, will they be able to make advances in electronic and display technology go further? In particular, as next year is expected to be the first year to generate the foldable smart phone, the phenomenon of PC use of smartphones is expected to accelerate. However, the high price of such a super-premier smartphone is likely to make it more innovative for consumers to open their wallets.According to the electronics industry on July 7, the internal memory of Samsung Electronics ` Galaxy S9 or Apple iPhone next year is likely to be 512 gigabytes, twice the amount of internal memory it currently has. Samsung Electronics announced on July 5 that it has begun mass production of its new generation of its Universal Flash Storage (512GB) for its mobile devices, allowing for the multI-seven-gigabyte smartphones next year. Considering that the iPhone 3G model, which started to become popular, was 16 gigabytes (GB) in capacity, the smartphone's memory has grown 32-fold in just a decade. As the smartphone has become more capable of storing and processing information, it can turn itself into an information-producing device like a laptop PC.The size of the screen will change drastically starting next year. Major manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics and China Whaway have pledged to mass production of pollable smartphones next year.Smartphones have grown to a size close to 6 inches and have grown to account for more than 80 percent of the smartphone's front, but the scope is still limited to watching video clips. When the folding smartphone is released next year, the display will grow twice as big as it currently is, even though it may be imagined simply. We plan to release a product when we can definitely solve some of the problems that are currently in the way, said Ko Dong-jin, president of Samsung Electronics in September. Apple has begun to develop an iPhone that can fold in partnership with LG Display, and Hwaway has a working smartphone sample.If this happens, smartphones can catch up with notebook PCs in memory and display, which is forecast to change the information technology market.The devices will be designed to absorb past feature phones, digital cameras, MP3 players, PMP, electronic dictionaries, and navigation devices, and then target PC areas. It can be seen as a product of technological advancement, but with more than 90 percent of smartphones deployed excluding some emerging countries, manufacturers are setting out strategies to create new demand and increase profitability.The question is whether there is innovation to convince consumers as much as the price increase. When the feature phones evolved into smartphones, the price went up 3-4 times. In addition, the market for tablet PCs, which has been competing with notebook PCs by increasing its screen, has shown a limit on its growth. "" We need to increase the completeness of the product so that we can deliver a new user experience or value that is appropriate, "" said an official of the display industry. Consumers in the superpremium market place more emphasis on technology than on price, so they have a positive outlook. We believe the functional integration of smartphones and PCs will also allow consumers to see strong price hikes, said Kim Seon-woo, an economist at Meritz Securities Co."
"[Donga Ilbo reporter, Park Cho-hee choky@donga.com It's called teenage slang these days. Teenagers eat their meals at school, so it is called ' fast food. ' And I've looked at that. What is the food for fast food?"" Eva Seva Tuna "" means ' Ovada. ' We changed the word "" Ova "" to "" Eva "" to make the pronunciation laugh on the Internet, and then we wrote a word in a similar word like "" ― "" to "" raep "" or "" "", "" and the word "" eva tunas, "" or "" the foreign canned fish brand, "" was added.

"" I heard they use it a lot on the Internet, but I haven't seen any students talking on the Internet in real life. People around me sometimes use a word or two to create an atmosphere, and nobody talks about it that way. What's the fuss about on TV or the newspaper? "" After I first heard it on a TV gag program called "" Kang Sang-ik (28, office worker), "" I started using a fast food processor with my friends. I usually use ' ojida ' (meaning great), ' Injeonggak ' (meaning acceptable), and ' Mubak ' (meaning big hit). I don't really understand what it says except what it says or what it says, "" ― Kim Seung-hyuk (12. Ducksu Elementary School) "" And I sometimes don't really understand what the accent is on. The sentence, "" Ji-goo, Neo-seong-Dong, Silent Night, "" is confusing. I think it's because I'm called Munchin, and I said, "" You know, I think I'm a mental institution, "" and I saw my sixth grade son, Kartock, who's a cipher student. I thought it would be impossible to communicate when I became a middle school student. After a long search and practice, are you saying, ' Do you want to admit anything good tonight?"" My son was surprised to hear that "" he said. "" I wonder who Shin (43. government employee) used to be short during Silla, right?"" There were slang, slang, short stories from your generation, right? I don't think it's particularly necessary to think about the problem with kids right now. Words can be used in transformation, if they agree. I think a little bit of personal use of it as a lubricant is what we call our lunch test, after the fad of what we call a food processor. You know what?Test it and be young or old. Because I think it's not as much curiosity about fast food as I want to feel that I'm not old yet. "" "" It's like a high school student, "" I guess. They shouldn't use rude language or abuse. So I don't think I'd really be guiding them. If you listen to the food supply that the students use, I don't think it's 100 percent coarse or abusive language or meaningless words, so it's not a word that could make you live longer. Rather, I think the problem is that the excessive use of slashes throughout the entire generation is more problematic than the language barrier, Chang Kyung-jun. It would be okay to use a short word for initial consonants, but I didn't understand how the ending words would spell similar words without meaning. "" Why do you do this, "" said Sohn Byung-jun, 43, of self-employment on the Internet. Other fad words can be funny or even silly, but fast food chains don't know the fun of language play and some seem to be vulgar. It's typical of the word "" come and go, "" but when my husband used it a while ago, he would show me baby poop and say, "" This is Jilin. Don't say that. "" And I said, "" Well, I don't know what you're talking about. "" And I found out that elementary school students were learning how to express themselves to their junior high school students by learning how to play computer games or learn how to eat fast food. "" Did you say ' Real Bob Doduk ' (genuine Bob Doduk)? I don't think you meant to be humble or rude, so you and your English teacher once taught you not to use Hangeul. "" Use an r instead of a vowel and an E instead of a string. ' I was in a rage. ' "" And so I said, "" I used to be a fan of Cywold or Buddy Buddy, who was a journalist, when I was in elementary school, and I was a special writer. But nobody speaks alien words now, does it? Now the chatting terms, like Bangaru, Tokebi language, Neokche, they're all gone. "" And when there was no Korean keyboard, there was no Korean keyboard. So, I used many words with consonants like "" OOO "". An-gol (moisture in the eyes) was used as a sign of tears, and GG (moisture in the eyes) as a recognition of defeat in Starcraft. It's a form of fast food. "" "" Kim Hyung-cheol (40. office worker) "" We have fast food, zoom. I feel closer to each other in the same group, but I was afraid that if the word changes so much, it would make the generation conflict worse. "" Especially, fast food is not a text-based word, but a voice-based word in the context of actual communication. And so the rhythms like Eva Seva and Katsugo and the Silent Night and all that stuff like that, "" said Park Seon-woo, who's been working as a teacher of Korean literature in the Internet again. When they were on TV, they were moving from what people were doing with their work to what was going on with their ambiance. In addition, the fast food use of the word ' gang tting jak ' or ' NULL gwiyeowo wo, ' which is used to rapidly break down letters, is differentiated from the older generation through the phrase ' . ― (( dae keo '). There are many derogatory terms such as the term "" wormworm, "" or dentures + critter. It's fun to use when you don't think it's funny, and you don't have much of a judge of modesty or discrimination. "" As a result, the stories of the generations who use fast food often tend to get lighter and lighter. Students need to think carefully and learn to discuss it in depth, and I'm afraid the buzz word has a far worse influence on education than it has ever been, and the buzz word is growing, which is the buzz word (46). "" The fast food fad will come to an end someday, but then more provocative and extreme expressions will become the second feeder, which will become popular among students.

"About 230 Korean-American Airways Compliants…B-1b, an American F-16s fighter jet, will depart from its Gwangju base on July 8 for two consecutive days. Military officials said yesterday that the non-Jailant ace training will be completed today as scheduled. About 230 U.S. Air Force planes were dispatched to the non-Jailant ace training camp on July 4. U.S. Air Force aircraft deployed at Japan and the U.S. mainland were reportedly scheduled to return to the base one after another. The drills also included six F-22s, six F-35A and 12 F-35B stealth bombers. It is unprecedented that 24 stealth fighters were deployed across the Korean Peninsula. It is interpreted that it is a strong military pressure on North Korea, which continues to threaten its nuclear weapons and missiles. The F-22 Raptors, which have excellent stealth capabilities, could penetrate the North's vulnerable air defense system, creating a huge pressure on the North. Some also say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's recent on-site map of the Yanggangdo Samjiyeon, the border area of North Korea, was made aware of the U.S. stealth fighter jet. The U.S. Air Force strengthened its pressure on North Korea by deploying long-range strategic bomber B-1b Lancer, over the Korean Peninsula, at Anderson Air Force Base in Guam, from June 6-7.The U.S. Air Force deployed B-1B bombers [Yonhap news agency] on July 6. During the training exercise, the U.S. Air Force deployed F-35A and F-35B in the airspace under a joint exercise plan. The training focused on boosting wartime operational capability. U.S. Air Force stealth fighters and other U.S. air forces are on a mission to beat and neutralize the enemy's core facilities in the early part of the war. In particular, the R.O.K. Air Force trained in both state and night practice by applying the Combined Pre-ATO, a joint operation plan that would strike down at 700 key North Korean targets. The ROK and the U.S. Air Force focused its exercise on preventing the infiltration of North Korean aircraft and accurately hitting nuclear and missile targets, including a mobile launch vehicle (TEL), by infiltration over the North. He also practiced hitting Chang Sa-jeong-po, the North's military force threatening the metropolitan area, and preventing the North's special forces from invading the sea. The training is the Ronald Reagan, and 3 aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt Lake, nimicheu a massive naval exercise, approximately 20 vessels deployed in the East.Take in.

Officials said on July 7 that the commission members, their families and the military units preparing for the event were not happy with the joint ceremony, so they are in an urgent situation to improve, adding that the so-called appointment ceremony was characterized by a special appointment ceremony at each of their respective schools. The Defense Ministry is expected to include improvement measures in its New Year's report in 2018. The Defense Ministry has held a ceremony every March since 2011 to gather around 5,000 new members of its Air Force Academy, Armed Forces Nursing Academy, the Army 3rd Military Academy and Army Student Military College at its Gyeryong-dae training center.

In the middle of last month, the rate dropped nearly 30 percent.Bloomberg News recently covered the Korean bit-coining craze. Korea accounts for only 1.9 percent of the global economy, and as of July 6, 21 percent of the world`s Bitcone deals were made in Korea.

"Last year, the citizens of Dong-A Ilbo complained about illegal parking in downtown Seoul. It is to prevent chronic illegal parking and resolve the parking crisis. The idea was to create a new parking space on the floor of Korean Air Co. and Namsan Mountain, which would be developed as a tourist attraction area in Songhyeon-dong, Jongno-gu, and to build a parking space on your own. The government was also advised to increase the penalty on illegally parked buses three to four times. However, a year later, no progress has been made. Except for 39 pages of bus parking space on Yejang, it has not been decided where to build the new parking lot. Large duty-free shops that do not offer self-help measures could not be allowed to pay more for their own transportation, and it is uncertain when to pass the city council to set up a parking lot. The illegal parking fines are just 50,000 won. Instead, the city will allow more parking in the city's streets. The target is four areas where parking was normally carried out on illegal roads (increase). They legalized parking fines by up to two hours. It is a strange administration that makes it legal to do so because it is illegal. Seoul City said Monday that starting this month, the Seoul Metropolitan Council will allow the entrance to Deoksugung Palace, Bukchang-dong, and Changgwang-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, and Honghwamun Gate and Seonnaemun Gate (75m) to be parked on weekdays. It is the size of parking for up to 34 cars at the same time. Seoul Metropolitan Government is looking for additional roads to target in Jongno and Jung-gu. The Duksoo - City Council section was only parked on weekends. Parking is allowed from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays. Bukchang-dong entrance, where both buses and cars were not allowed to park, will be parked only by tour bus from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Changgyeonggung-ro will increase the number of parking allowed to 16 from the previous 11. All vehicles can park inside the building from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. but only tourist buses can park in the future. Most of these areas have been illegally packed by tourist buses. In addition to weekends, the ‘ tourist bus wall ’ often stopped even during weekdays when hundreds of thousands of people were passing by. Until Chinese tourists decreased in sight due to the Chinese government's retaliation against the THAAD (High Level missile defense system), many people complained that the Chinese tourists were being blocked and smoke was always emitted. The walls are expected to reappear as the Seoul Metropolitan Government even allows parking on weekday roads. The tourism industry expects Chinese tourists to increase again starting next February with the cancellation of China's ' Han Jin ' policy. Chang (34), a company in Jung-gu, said, If there are many illegally parked tour buses, I was concerned that I could not see other cars coming by me every time I crossed the street. If we don`t stop this, we can not agree to legitimize it. Critics point out that parking spaces in the city are out of proportion with ordinary citizens. Victory. It is not easy to induce the buses from the current collective tourism behavior of staying in one place for at least half an hour, to Seoul Station or Gyeongbok Palace parking lot. We are steadily securing parking lots and increasing parking lots so as not to disturb traffic, said Park. The Seoul Metropolitan Government runs a parking lot for a tourist bus, which costs 800 million won per year to have 33 cars at Seoul Station, but it only spends around 30 percent of its cars.Hwang Tae-ho taeho@donga.comABC News ' visit to the U.S. on July 5 (local time) was the first to visit Mason, 8) and Mylan Brazel's graveyard on a recent visit.Alfred (Alfred, 37), the father of the Mason and Mylan brothers, was diagnosed with terminal cancer in February while serving as the chief of the U.S. Army.

On July 28, Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon said, If young people and students entered virtual currencies to make money at a speedy time, they could have seriously distorted or distorted the effects of such crimes as drug dealing.The government is belatedly agonizing over whether to lay the foundations for a virtual currency. It is known that the Ministry of Justice has recently established a new Virtual Monetary Task Force and is reviewing various regulations. They say that the government intends to prevent virtual currency from being misused for crimes such as hacking, drug trafficking, and money laundering or that the virtual currency market is overheated. The National Tax Service is reviewing the possibility of imposing corporate, inheritance and gift taxes on virtual currencies and imposing capital gains tax or tax rates on transactions.Currently, fees are incurred for transactions of virtual currency, but no taxes are incurred because there is no basis for related taxes. The tax office said, "" In order to assess taxes, it was important to gather information on who made transactions and how, and to submit mandatory data from the Strategy and Finance Ministry and the Virtual Monetary Exchange.

Rep. Joo Sung-young of the main opposition Grand National Party disclosed a copy of the CD, saying in a parliamentary audit of the Supreme Public Prosecutors ` Office, We have obtained a deposit certificate worth 10 billion won ($ 13 million) estimated as slush funds for DJs. When the opposition said, If you have any, do not hide behind your immunity, Rep. Joo made the same argument the next day when he appeared on the radio.It is the National People`s Party of Korea supreme council member Park Joo-won who gave the slush funds to Rep. Joo in 2006, an official at the ruling camp told a daily newspaper on Monday. Rep. Park Joo-won, who retired from the Supreme Public Prosecutors ` Office after working at the information planning office, was the nation`s top intelligence officer, he said, and Rep. Ju was probably sure because it was information given by supreme council member Park.According to him, Park gave two more information to Rep. Kang Man-gil in early 2006 when he was president of Sangji University, allegations of corruption, and corruption in the exchange of electronic voting machines by the central government. Rep. Joo disclosed the suspicion of corruption at Sangji University in April 2006 and the suspicion of corruption over the replacement of electronic counting machines during the National Assembly's February 2007 parliamentary session. Meanwhile, Park became the mayor of Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, on the ticket of the GNP. It is enough to suspect that he was nominated for providing information he obtained during his 24 years with the prosecution.The question is why did Rep. Ju burst out in October 2008 after keeping a tip-off on DJ slush funds for more than two years? It took time to tie up information on DJ slush funds, Rep. Joo said in a news interview.But if the ' data ' received at first from supreme council member Park were perfect, there is no reason to let it go for two years. Indeed, the 10 billion-won CD was released by Rep. Joo in February 2006, but Park retired from the prosecution in June 2005. The CD was not obtained while Park was in the prosecution. In the end, the GNP since the inauguration of Lee Myung-bak administration to the opposition days, information that they did not have to know Park added the first report of the supreme council member can not rule out the possibility.Former senior executives at the National Tax Service, said a junior international investigation, working at the time ‘ from Han Lee Myung-bak is the president to be nice to Roh Moo-hyun, former president.There is a Pantech is often heard about, and prying, as the secret dj said.In September 2008, Han went to Germany to try to obtain information on Korean accounts of tax association figures that were cited as one of the hiding places of DJ slush funds.

Joo. Ask Kim Tae-jung, the prosecutor general at the 1997 presidential election when the slush fund was first debated, Park explained in an explanation that was hard to understand. Park is the supreme council member who holds the key to the truth about where he obtained the information and why he handed it over to the political circle.< Kang Jin-gu and Park Ju-yeon kangk@jyunghyang.com> ▶ Facebook [Twitter] < Kyunghyang newspapers forbidden from illegally copying and redistributing"

In particular, men in their 40s and older complain of the effects of binge drinking, and young female office workers in their 20s and 30s experience "" segmented dining, "" worrying about sexual harassment.Most office workers feel uncomfortable about drinking parties regardless of their position or age, according to a recent report.According to a survey of 989 office workers conducted by the Korea Employment portal on May 7, 90.5 percent of respondents answered that drinking parties are burdensome. Among the respondents, 54.9 percent experienced stress from dining together with 63.9 percent saying they experienced difficulties at work.However, the worries and burdens of dining together differed significantly between men in their 40s and older and young women in their 20s and 30s.Middle-aged men were burdened by the fact that they were used to the Korean traditional organization culture of dining, which saw the company dinner as an extension of work. More people are experiencing symptoms of "" problematic drinking, "" which include binge drinking, excessive drinking, and high dependence on alcohol.In fact, according to a survey of 72,119 male and female workers conducted by Gangbuk Samsung Hospital, 61,152 (22.4 percent) were in the group of problematic drinkers. Among them, men in their 40s or older made up 56.5 percent. The results of such a survey are an analysis that it is a side effect of a vertically structured work culture that emphasizes organization rather than individuals.A (49) who works for a local public institution complained, "" When I was young, I saw my boss as an extension of my work, but it was just as hard. ""Professor of sociology at Jeonbuk University Seol Dong-hoon said, "" In East Asia, people should identify themselves with companies and people should feel that they are lazy when they go on drinks. ""The biggest concerns of female office workers are the sex crimes (sexual harassment, sexual harassment, and sexual harassment) committed while on a drinking occasion. According to the report by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, 39.8 percent of 500 male and female office workers who experienced sexual harassment were sexually molested by their superiors, and 46.7 percent of female workers (440 such as these) were surveyed. Therefore, although many people say, "" Let's go hiking and watching movies instead of drinking, "" this is not a fundamental measure.Cho said, Drinking may have been an occasion to express unfair influence at work, but it is rather dangerous to see it as a recipe for sexual harassment.Kim Min-soon, reporter of the press at soon@segye.com"
"【 Seoul = New System&amp;Fisherd;Let's Safe Asset, Workshart's Safe, Profiter-Money Assemblyment, No Taxes, "" Trust in Speculation-Chaining Technology Investment "" - It will eventually explode. Worse than tulip bulbs (Al-Juri). "" (investment bank JP Morgan Chase Jamie Diemon, CEO of Jacquer-Market, who says, "" Bitcone is not a payment tool but a speculative toy bank. ""In Korea, financial authorities have announced that they will not directly institutionalize the Bitcone transaction. In fact, the Financial Services Commission on July 6 interpreted that "" virtual currency is not possible to trade in Korea because it can not be seen as the underlying asset of derivatives under the Capital Markets Act. ""However, the Korean investment frenzy towards Bitcone has become more heated lately. Foreign news agencies are also paying attention with surprising responses. Bloomberg also reported that "" Korea is emerging as a kind of "" ground zero "" among global virtual currency fanatics. Amid this growing controversy in Korea, it is being debated whether Bitcone is a safe investment asset or a dangerous speculation tool. Why is it that the "" bit-coining "" frenzy grew in Korea?According to Index Inc., a virtual currency exchange agency, the international market price of beatcoiner surpassed $ 14,000 the previous day. The price of the one-bit coin was around $ 46,199 (about 15,990,000 won) as of 5 p.m. local time. At the same time, the nation's largest virtual currency exchange, Bi sseom, saw a record of 7.07 million won. It is about 16 percent more premium than global market prices. As the price of Korean bills is 10 to 20 percent higher than global ones, the term "" Korea Premium "" was born. As super-target investors flocked to Korea, it is estimated that the premium has risen. In fact, the daily average daily exchange rate of Bitcone is about 13 percent in the global market. It is the third highest percentage of the yen (50 percent) and the U.S. dollar (27 percent). As investors flock to get a premium, the share could grow higher.The Korean financial sector and the IT industry have different views on the background of the Korean bit-coining craze. The existing financial circle sees the Bitcone market as no different from a speculative and dense gambling place. Financial figures point out that the daily flow of bit-coining information and the failure to buy a bit coin only causes me to fall behind in everything, sparking speculation. On the basis of this, he noted the speculative sentiment of Korea, which had stood out in the derivatives market in the past. The Korean derivatives market in the world was brisk until 2011 when it reached the number one spot. When individual investors joined in investment in futures and options, the government said it would capture speculative forces, and since then, the market has cooled considerably. "" Investors are really asking whether the Korean financial market is really growing in terms of the high demand because the bills are now unregulated and the profits are not paying, "" said Lee Dae-kee, an economist at the Korea Institute of Finance. Other reasons are that China strengthened its regulations on virtual currency exchanges. That is because it is possible that some investment demand could have been transferred to Korea, where there is no restriction. Until the end of last year, the yuan was overwhelming, accounting for 90 percent of the world's bit-coined transactions.On the other hand, the people who recognize beatcoiner as an investment place a high priority on block chain technologies themselves. Investors who believe that block chains will revolutionize the future are increasing their investment by considering Bitcone as a safe asset. In a similar vein, the recent decline in the price of gold and the rise in the price of beatcoiner are interpreted as a traditional safety asset. Some say that the funds lost on low interest rates should be considered as alternative investment methods.Oh Jeong-keun, professor of finance and IT at Konkuk University, said, "" The current situation is about overheated investment, not to be seen as speculation. "" "" As mutual investment is possible, it is easy to understand and hacking concerns have been resolved in Japan. "" There are effects on the market, which have lost a lot of liquidity, but have no place to invest, Oh added. hacho@newsis.comThe chairman of the committee, Chang Hwan-jin, reads an article on supreme council member Park Joo-won at the 39th supreme council meeting of the People's Party in Yeouido, Seoul yesterday.

Politicians in the ruling circles at hihong@yna.co.kr analyzed that the merger talks with the right party leader could also lose steam as Park, who is classified as an Ahn's aide, made an official announcement. The slush fund scandal began on Oct. 20, 2008 when GNP Rep. Joo Seong-young, then a member of the National Assembly`s Judiciary and Legislation Committee, announced a copy of a 10 billion won slush fund deposit certificate issued in February 2006. Joo handed it over to the prosecution, saying I received it from a former prosecution official. However, the former president of libel by the Supreme Public Prosecutors ' Office, and sued the state senator Kim concluded that there is no connection with the president was the cd. Joo was found guilty of defamation in court and was sentenced to three million won in fines. According to a newspaper report on the same day, Lee, who allegedly tipped off a CD to Rep. Joo, was supreme council member Park, who had worked in the criminal information planning office of the Supreme Public Prosecutors ' Office. As a result, suspicion has been raised that Park, who retired from the prosecution in 2005, ran for local elections and won the election to Ansan mayor in 2006 as part of the ruling Grand National Party, was related to a slush fund scandal. If Park's tip was in 2006 when she had already left the prosecution, it is questionable whether Park would have obtained information related to the CD copies legally. Some point out that it is questionable whether the time difference between the two years until 2008, when former Congressman Joo disclosed this fact. Regarding this, Park told Yonhap news, I don`t understand why the stories of the past 12 or 12 years are now being reported, and it is absurd. We can discuss crime stories with each other (when we hear each other), Park said, adding, As former Congressman Joo is a member of the judiciary committee, former prosecutor's office, and natural meeting, eating, and talking back and forth. As to the suspicion that the two year time difference between the tip and disclosure was related to the nomination process for Ansan mayor, it was quite not at all. `` Ask the Congressman.

However, some GNP lawmakers say they can not tolerate Park's suspicion. Park, who is called the "" eternal chief of staff for DJs, "" posted an article on Facebook saying, "" I can't stop being shocked. "" And "" The fake news, of course, hurt the bereaved families deeply. "" We urge the prosecution to thoroughly investigate and reveal the facts, Park said, a rumor had been raised that the source of the suspicion was Park. The former president's last secretary also told reporters, Rep. Choi Kyoung-hwan of the supreme council member Park sent the position, "" the bereaved families, and reveal a way that engage in illegal political maneuvering.Apologize and all must take responsibility, shot back angrily. Former chairman Chun Jung-bae said in a telephone interview, It is a very important political issue. Is there a statute of limitations in politics? As the aggressive offensive by high-ranking members of Jeolla Province is becoming fierce, it is predicted that Ahn's integrated drive could be damaged. If former GNP lawmaker Choi Myung-kil, who has been at the forefront of his campaign for unification with Ahn, loses his parliamentary seat due to a guilty ruling on the election law, Park will be forced to resign as supreme council member. Ahn is obviously taking the situation seriously and trying to respond. I believe the nature of the case can not be closed down, Ahn said during a meeting with the highest level of officials.

MBC, which was plagued by two general strikes after the conservative government took control of broadcasting, is set to start anew in 10 years.Choi Seung-ho, the new president of MBC, smiles brightly after his final interview with MBC's candidate for the presidency at the Broadcasting and Culture Promotion Association in Seoul Monday. She, who prefers casual clothes, did not wear a tie at a policy briefing on July 1, but attended the event in a suit with a tie on it.Jeong Yeon-ho, a reporter at the Korea Broadcasting and Promotion Association (visiting staff), conducted a final interview with three candidates for the post of CEO of Lee Woo-ho, Lim Heung-sik, and Choi Seung-ho at the office in Yeouido, Seoul on July 7. At an MBC shareholders ' meeting held right after the board of directors, Choi Seung-ho was officially appointed. The new president is due to stay in office until the general shareholders ' meeting in 2020, which is the remaining term of the former MBC president Kim Jang-kyum.Choi, who joined MBC as a PD in 1986, dug up the ` fraud case ` in 2005 through ` PD Diary ` and directed ` prosecutor and sponsor `, ` Four Major Rivers, and the Korean Broadcasting System, ` which awarded the Best Circumcision Award in 2010. After being fired by a general strike in 2012, he acted as a producer of alternative media outlets. The group launched a full-scale strike on MBC by producing a documentary called "" The Independants, "" which captured the government's control over public broadcasting in August.Choi, one of the main figures of MBC's heyday, successfully returned to the Buddhist priesthood in five years, but his future will be a journey. His first task is to restore workers who were unfairly dismissed five years ago. Former union leaders Lee Yong-ma, former chairman of the union Jung Young-ha, former head of the labor union Kang Jeong-woong, former chairman of the Korean Federation of Culture Broadcasting Unions and journalist Park Seong-je, who returned to work in the strike on July 2000, were forced to quit.

Along with the anchor replacement of MBC's main news network, the news desk is expected to see a major shift in news coverage. Now news desk ratings are at the 4 percent level, depending on how much you want to restore your viewers ` trust.Conflict between public loans and experienced workers is also resolved. The gap caused by the layoffs was filled by hiring a large number of employees, and by increasing the number of experienced employees instead of newly appointed public loans, the Roh and Roh conflict had intensified. Many experienced workers participated in the general strike, but some are concerned that they will be delayed in the course of the sale of honors and restructuring. In addition, they should provide transparency in the process of appointing the heads of MBC, coexistence with outsourcing companies that were disputed during the strike, and improvement of the treatment of temporary workers at broadcasting stations.The labor union issued a statement shortly after the appointment of the chairman, guaranteeing that "" it is guaranteed that members who were illegally fired during the general strike that called for fair broadcasting five years ago would have a strong sense of fairness in producing the new chairman's office and the broadcaster's political autonomy.

After the MBC strike in 2012, many announcers were forced to leave for exile. Some were successful. Shin Dong-ho and Bae Hyun-jin are the most famous announcers. The labor union claims that announcer Shin Dong-ho directly engaged in the false wire appointments of the announcers after they did not participate in the strike and completely excluded them from the scene. Bae Hyun-jin attended the strike, dropped out of the union, announced the strike would be withdrawn, and returned to the main anchor of the news desk. Former producer Choi Seung-ho was appointed as the new president of MBC on July 7. Choi was dismissed for taking part in the strike, and then interfering with his work.

Bae Hyun-jin, an announcer, wrote a message on the company's bulletin board, "" Bae Hyun-jin, "" explaining why he returned to work. We lost political neutrality as labor unions turned to certain political figures, including opposition lawmakers, progressives and socialtainers, he said, inviting prominent opposition lawmakers and liberals to visit the union. The weight of the people on one camp felt rather shaky. Although the crew members strongly criticized Bae's attitude, they settled on top of the "" news desk "" anchor regardless of Bae. ■ The [Culture Broadcasting > News Desk Screen] has stirred up controversy over the operation of Munhwa Broadcasting News.

In fact, I have turned on CC to confirm the relationship. "" Although I did not know him immediately, I did say hello when I was in regular appointments as my manager said.

Shin Dong-ho, head of the announcer department, was recently sued by his colleagues for unfair labor practices. 28 cultural TV announcers and the National Union of Media and Trade, Culture and Broadcasting Corporation Director Shin Dong-ho told reporters on October 16 in front of the Seoul Western District Public Prosecutors ' Office that they were involved in an unfair investigation. They said, "" Shin Dong-ho was directly involved in the improper wire appointments of 11 of the announcers who took part in the strike in 2012, and he was unable to explain to them mentally when they were completely excluded from the production scene. "" Shin has served as the post manager in Anounseo for three years since he was appointed as head of the national affairs bureau in 2013, and has maintained his position since then as head of announcer. However, Kim Jang-kyum recently stepped down from the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation's current affairs program, titled ' Eye Care Center ' when he retired. MBC's new president, Choi Seung-ho (left), returns to the company after five years of being dismissed from his post, moves to the CEO's office with union head Kim Yeon-kook as his first appearance at the MBC Building in Mapo-gu, Seoul. Choi made her first day of work through the gates used by rank-and-file members of the staff without taking the elevator to work. In the future, director Shin Dong-ho and announcer Bae Hyeon-jin are not expected to face a solid future. Choi Seung-ho, the president of the company, announced on the first day of his visit that he would hold them accountable. Choi told CBS's (CBS) radio that he had been shown up to date and "" I think there are a lot of people who can not afford to see their face when I see their face exposed, "" adding, "" In case of MBC's past 11 announcer Shin Dong-ho, I think. Bae is also the anchor for Bae, adding, I think that part of the news bureau will probably establish a new anchor system. Both of them indicated that they could not remain as they are. Earlier, the chief spokesman of the Korea Freedom Party, Chang Je-won, commented orally when Choi was appointed as the new president, saying, MBC has become a complete broadcast of Roh. The new, labor-backed CEO has taken over the MBC office, said, We were afraid to say whether he would make fair greetings or not and how much we would have watched with high public interest. As for this, Choi said, It is a company that can not afford to buy. But it is too much to say that it is not even state-run, said Roh Young-young, adding, I will not intervene in the reports and the viewing rate will probably go up.Lee Jae-ho, journalist, please be my best friend in the Hankyoreh!

"Lee Young-ryul, former chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office, is in Seoul's second hearing Friday. Lee Young-ryul (age 59, Supreme Court of Public Prosecutors ' Office), who was put on trial for "" Money Balloon Dinner Dinner, "" was acquitted by the Seoul District Court at park7691@newsis.com The Seoul Central District Court's criminal agreement was announced on July 8. The Seoul Central District Court ruled that Lee's former district prosecutors ' office violated the law on corruption and prohibition of bribery and other wrongdoings by calling it an "" law against bribery "" As a result, the former chief of the district public prosecutor will avoid the disgrace of being in violation of the law, which prohibits people from asking for favors. Prosecutors last month sought a fine of 5 million won at a decision-related trial. The prosecution stated that, "" unlike the cases of giving out of a violation of the prohibition of requesting payment, no specific standard of handling was yet to be found, "" and that the amount of the payment for cases of taxes was less than two million won. It is miserable to see the prosecution leading the case and then becoming the accused and arguing with the prosecution over the law, Lee said in a statement at the end of the hearing. Lee was indicted April 21 by six senior prosecutors and three former head of the prosecution, including Ahn Tae-keun, who led the investigation team, on charges of dinning one million won (47,000,000 U.S. dollars). According to a joint audit by the Justice Ministry and the Supreme Public Prosecutors ` Office, the former prosecutor paid the money from the special activity expenses and paid a meal fee worth 95,000 won per person with a task card. The former chief of the district attorney was dismissed on license. afero@newsis.com> Public Service Recruitment Prospection....2234 Problem-Problem - Recruitment of institutional leaders, local residents ' preferences - recruitment of civil affairs related directors, private affairs, civil affairs, and private affairs agencies - without notice - and 2 of the Government Planning and Finance Ministry - on July 8As a result of the government's investigation into the recruitment scandal, heads of state-run organizations and children of local leaders were appointed by parachute. The government held a special investigation into corruption by 20 ministries, including the Ministry of Justice, the National Police Agency, the Ministry of Public Administration and Security, and the Office of Personnel Reform presided over by Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance Kim Yong-jin on July 8 at Seoul National University. There were 2234 cases (tentative) pointed out to be problematic. Types of recruitment irregularities are diverse, such as incorrect direction for operation of the relevant evaluation criteria, improper formation of the request and request committee, and inadequate change of the requirement for recruitment by re starting personnel. The target organizations were 275, which are the survey of the overall recruitment of full-time, non-regular workers and transfer positions from 2013 to 2017. According to the results of the survey, some public institutions used unfair evaluation criteria, such as manipulating scores. This year, the A public institution randomly manipulated the career scores of applicants to have them interviewed by a recruitment officer. The applicants ' career scores were reflected and those who were expected to get high scores were cut. The public institution rejected the idea of giving additional points to applicants during the interview the year before and hired children of influential local people.The head of the agency was even asked to say hello and pulled out "" parachute. "" C Public Service Agency president hired an introducer who was introduced in 2011 without open recruitment. When the contract ended, he was upgraded to the rank of a high-ranking official and re-appointed. The D public institution directed the recruitment in 2011 when the head of the agency delivered the resume of the children of acquaintances to HR officials. Children of acquaintances received preferential treatment on a contract basis and then transferred to full-time work. In 2014, public institutions hired an email to apply to a head of an institution living abroad. The jury was also formed by rule of thumb. F Public agencies require applicants to participate as an interviewer (three out of five) in 2014 in the same private placement as the candidate. The head of the organization, who is also a member of the same private placement team, was accepted after ordering the recruitment of employees without a deliberation by the personnel committee. G Public institutions had applicants at their interview room in 2016, rather than interviews. He inquired after only one of the two people interviewed, and the one who had received the question was accepted. H Public Service provided judges with applications for admission with a parent's name, job, and place of work with high scores and assigned them to top children within the institution in 2013.The posting of applications for jobs was also violated. In 2014, public institutions did not publish their job postings in the management information disclosure system (Alio), and only posted the announcements on their websites of associations. Since then, certain people who were appointed or recommended by former high-ranking officials of the institution have been preferential workers. We have also changed our starters. Successful applicants for the first round of screening for documents will be selected from two to five times the number of people scheduled to be selected. However, the number of successful candidates was increased to 30 or 45 to allow certain applicants to pass. He was accepted even when he failed to meet the requirements for hiring. J Public Agency conducted an audit of documents and interviews in 2014 with no necessary documents (career certificate, diploma, etc.) and hired a special non-disabled person without a relevant field of experience. In 2012, public agencies passed applicants who were not related to the majors (Ph.D.s. Sanggyeong) specified in their job postings through paper screening. Later, the head of the agency randomly attended the interview and made comments on the candidate's support before he was accepted. The government is planning to file disciplinary measures against 143 cases that are suspected of corruption in hiring and ask for investigation in 23 cases. Of 290 reports received at the Employment Discriptions Reporting Center, 21 have already been commissioned to investigate. Special inspections by 824 local public agencies and 272 other civility-related organizations under the supervision of the Ministry of Public Administration and Security, will be conducted until the end of this year. We will select 19 institutions to investigate in depth and conduct a three-day on-site investigation by July 22, Vice Minister Kim Yong-jin stressed, We will root out recruitment irregularities.Subscriptions to "" idylI "" are requested on Naver Network (choigiga@edaily.co.kr) According to medical media Medical Express and others, a team of scientists at Temple University in Britain recently announced that animal tests have shown that canola oil can worsen dementia. Pratoko's team announced a study that showed that the same experiment was done with olive oil, reducing the dementia-causing substances in the brain and improving memory. However, Canola said, "" It appears quite the opposite, "" adding, "" We should not conclude that vegetable oils are good for our health without proof. "" The researchers tested mice that had been genetically engineered into developing Alzheimer's. Before Alzheimer's disease began, the 6-month-old mice were divided into two groups and fed in large quantities with regular foods on one side and canola oil on the other (two spoons daily). At the age of 12 months, he underwent various tests. First of all, the Canola Oil Group weighed an average of 18 percent. In addition, after measuring the working memory, short-term memory, and learning ability through a maze experiment, the Kanola oil group's working memory impairment was much worse than that of its regular oil group. When examining brain tissue, the composition of amyloid beta between the two groups was different. Alzheimer-braid Neuro-Nerve with beta amyloid beta is a protein that is created in the space between brain cells that congregates and blocks signal passages between brain cells when it accumulates. However, among amyloid beta, 1-42 is more harmful and insoluble, with 1-40 being more soluble and a buffer for 1-42. In tissue tests, the canollas significantly decreased amyloid beta 1-40, which led to more amyloid beta plaque in the brain, with brain cells wrapped around a relatively harmful 1-42. In addition, the number of contact between nerve cells has decreased significantly. This suggests that the synapse of the Canola oil eaters was significantly damaged. A synapse connects signals between neurons (neurons) and other cells and involves making and recalling memories. Pratico said the findings showed that eating Kanola oil for an extended period of time would at least not help brain health, and stressed that it was ' good for the health of the plant, ' and added that it was not proven. The research team said it will study whether the oil will affect experiments and other neurodegenerative diseases in order to calculate the minimum exposure period and the minimum amount of time that causes brain changes. It will also determine whether the use of canola oil affects the oxidation of tau protein, another cause of Alzheimer's disease, and the tangling of nerve fibers. As no effects on tau protein were detected during the six-month food supply experiment, longer tests are needed. The results of the study were published on July 7 (local time) in the online science journal Scientific Reports.() Memory [Getty Image Bank provided ]choibg@yna.co.kr ▶ Report and enquiry (Click!) ▶ Set up a comprehensive collection of latest trends (click!)"

It all began when Trump was this word "" Jerusalem the capital of Israel by formal recognition of the president has become. "" As I expected, the storm was violent after I had already recompressed it. The Palestinians were immediately in the air, and U.S. allies like Britain and Japan were opposed. Pope Francis, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, also expressed concern, saying, "" The current state of Jerusalem should be maintained. "" The United States and Israel are working together to fight the world.● Although the international community does not recognize it, there is a good reason why the international community should unite to object and be concerned. To do this, it is important to understand the historical context surrounding Jerusalem, where Israel established its own Jerusalem law a long time ago and named Jerusalem its own capital. The international community has adopted U.N. Security Council Resolution 478 in 1980 to condemn Israel's occupation of Jerusalem and determine that Jerusalem laws are in violation of international law.Israel has since declared it the capital unilaterally, but the international community has refused to recognize it in terms of the U.N. resolution and observance of international laws. Many U.S. leaders, especially in the past, have pledged to look ahead on Israel's recognition of the capital in the face of Jewish votes, but no one really lived.Since the international community doesn't recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, nations, including the United States, have been operating their own embassies in Tel Aviv, not in Jerusalem.Trump, the United States president ● taboos? By the way, Trump Trump, president the international community has broken this principle has been kept for more than 50 years. There are different interpretations of why Trump broke the "" taboo "" rule, but the first thing that is commonly said is that the Trump administration has more Jewish power than any previous administration.Trump president's husband, her husband, Jared's oldest daughter, ibangka kusyuneo are Jews known as Senior Advisor. The foreign car has also been converted to Judaism after marrying.

It is noticeable that the key business foundation of Trump, a real estate tycoon and entrepreneur from Iran, is Jewish capital. Trump is absolutely based on his business partner, the trust of Jewish people to maintain the strong than any other president, it supports Israel,.I have it. Some analysts say Trump, who is suffering from the Russian scandal during the presidential election, threw Jerusalem cards to reverse the situation when special prosecutor Robert Muller's investigation aimed him.● In Arab countries, where conflicts and conflicts are repeated, the issue is a new spark in the chaotic Middle East's explosive religion and sectarian strife. Large anti-IsraelI protests took place in the West Bank, near Jerusalem. Palestine, who had been at odds with Israel, has declared three days of "" anger "" until Friday.There are also growing calls for an Intipada, or anti-IsraelI struggle. The sectarian divide as Sunni Shi'ite on the issue of this issue is meaningless and the entire Islamic world is united. Following the first Intipada in 1987 and the second in 2000, the third Intipada is concerned.Islamic protest Trump, Trump the president to recognize the capital of Israel in Jerusalem is a cultural anthropologist, Hanyang University professor iuisu the explained it this way.

To do that, I think I determined that I could not make a new edition without touching Pandora's box. So I opened the box. "" And he admitted Jerusalem as the capital, but moving the actual embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem is a different matter. Even though there have not been specific reports by the U.S. media that Trump has entrusted Israel's ambassador to decide before the embassy, the move to Jerusalem would make it easy for the U.S. Embassy to move to the forefront of its global security cycle, and make it a target for terrorists ' priority.

"▽ Asian economy reporter Jang Yong-jin = There is a growing public consensus that the punishment should be dealt with in case of drunk crime should be dealt with with carefully, but the court and other legal circles insist on it. The legal profession agrees to exclude the main view of certain crimes, such as rape and domestic violence, but can not be eliminated altogether. Though 40 bills aimed at abolishing the drinking law have been submitted since the 18th National Assembly (2008-2012), it is also the reason why it is hard for the judiciary committee of the National Assembly to cross the threshold. An incumbent lawmaker who served as a lawyer as a former prosecution official, told the judiciary committee to keep an eye on the law enforcement profession without knowing because there are many law enforcement officials there. Though the difference is modest, the mood of the court is the most conservative in the legal profession. The courts are officially neutral about the amendment. We understand that various revisions have been proposed, a Supreme Court official said on July 8, adding, We expect legislation to take into consideration the grand principles of criminal law, including accountability and social necessity.However, the judges ' views are different. Judges usually suggested the individual laws that require the exclusion of sexual harassment, saying, "" If the current law is left as it is, it can reflect public opinion. "" We should be careful to do away with the whole idea, said a judge at a Seoul court. "" There were cases where an offender (a criminal error) was needed, and in some cases, the judge's opinion required a higher sentence, such as the offence of committing a crime, or of making it more discretionary. "" The reason why the court is passive in abolishing drinking and drinking police is because it is not currently necessary to look at the scene. If the judge decides whether or not to investigate the case, he or she should adjust the standard of assessment by the court, not revise or enact a law. Article 10-2 of the current criminal law lists weak mind and body as reasons for the decline, but it does not specify whether or not to include alcohol in the weak physical and mental and physical categories, and leaves it to the judgment of the judge. The fact that the court has recently turned a blind eye to the treatment of alcohol has also contributed to this atmosphere. After the incident, the court also rejected the previous lenient judgment on drunk crime, almost conceding the case of drinking, said a senior judge at a local court. "" I recently found a judge who requires me to attach a written review to the state of mental illness, including doctor's diagnosis, "" he said, explaining, "" not only the circumstances of my crime, but also my usual behavior, drinking habits. "" However, some legal circles, including lawyers, said, "" The court has failed to keep up with the changes in public perception. "" A senior lawyer from a large law firm said, It is the law-recognized court practice that allowed people to take advantage of the anti-controlling influence of the law provisions, which led to the quick recognition of the laur`s requests for revision. Some judges tend to turn their requests for revisions to the law into populism, he added.

"" The peace process is over with the U.S. decision, "" Haniya said on November 6, 1717.11.06. "" You have to start Intipatha against your enemies of Zionist. "" He declared : "" Jerusalem is ours. "" Because Jerusalem is a holy place of Christianity, Judaism and Islam, the historical conflict surrounding it has never stopped. The United Nations declared Jerusalem an area not belonged to any country under international law in 1947. Israel, however, took control of Jerusalem through the first and third wars in the Middle East in 1948 and 1967, and vowed to make it the capital. Palestinians then staged a campaign in Jerusalem to protest Israel's rule. The first Intipada happened until September 1993 when Palestinian youths were killed in Israeli military trucks in December 1987. About 160 Israelis and 1,200 Palestinians died in the process. Intifada has died out since the Oslo peace agreement was signed in 1993 and the Palestinian Authority was established in 1996, but tensions in the region have continued. Former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon made a surprise visit to the Islamic holy ground in Jerusalem in September 2000, which led to another Intipada second. Since then, around 1000 Israelis and 3,000 Palestinians have been sacrificed until February 2005.ez@newsis.com>"
"This year was a transitional period for Android smartphones. Android phones ' overall specs, including strong chipsets, robust endurance rated anti - dustproof IP 68, high performance cameras not envious of DLSR, fast charging support and long-lasting batteries, were highly innovative, while they were highly standardized. It was a year of intense design competition to reduce bezel thickness.Of course, there are outstanding products among the bold and bold. Samsung unveiled its Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8, proving that it is building a different field from Apple. Google, which started developing hardware, released its second smartphone after last year and showed how the combination of software and hardware could create synergy, as Google did. Whaway, the world's third-largest smartphone maker, received attention for planting artificial intelligence in chipsets. We looked around at the Android phones at home and abroad, which were impressed by the end of 2017.Samsung was hit hard last year by the Galaxy Note 7 battery explosion gate. Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong's involvement with the Food and Drug Administration has added insult to injury to injury, and spent 2016 in crisis. All were crises stemming from a self-infested tree.Ironically, the 2016 crisis gave an indication of Samsung's health in 2017. Samsung's new like-detection system, iridescence of the iris and Infiniti Display's edge design, featured Samsung's colors. Unlike Apple's Siry, Google's Google Assistant, Samsung has built its own voice recognition secretary, Bigsby, into its product to reveal Samsung`s vision of becoming a voice recognition platform. However, due to the delayed support of Bigsby in English, the anticipated market has left much to be desired.Galaxy S8, which developed Samsung's own personal characteristics, received favorable reviews at home and abroad. Samsung said in a quarterly earnings report that it earned 30.01 trillion won in mobile sales and 4.06 trillion won in operating profit from the expansion of global sales of Galaxy S8·V8 +. The third quarter also generated a operating profit of 3.29 trillion won. The new Samsung flagship model led the growth of the smartphone market in the third quarter, Gatner said.In emerging economies, the medium - and medium-sized price lines of the Galaxy and the Galaxy J series were in high demand. According to Canalis, the world's highest selling smartphone provider in the third quarter was Samsung Electronics ' service-type J2 Prime, with a total of about 7.8 million units. It has been satisfactory in both the mainstream and the mainstream models.Would it have been possible to revive other manufacturers if deadly issues like Samsung broke out last year? At least it was a clear year that Samsung has the strongest position among Android phones.LG Electronics released the G7 and the 300 series in the second half. First launched in the first half of this year, the LG 6 has opened fire on the Bezelis design. It was a full-space display with an 18:9 ratio and a double-diameter dual camera on the back, and it looked especially comfortable and durable. The concept that anyone can become the main character in a movie was attractive when it was released in the second half. Until now, however, LG Electronics has continued its deficit march for the last 10 quarters in the smartphone business alone. Mobile communication service, which is responsible for smartphones, posted 2.8077 trillion won in revenue and 3753 billion won in operating losses. Sales rose 7.9 percent year-on-year as the I-sets of the G-designments and supply-designed smartphones continued to sell at premium smartphones, LG said.There is no turning point to try to bounce back into the black while the deficit persists. LG needs a vision that is more than hardware but only LG phones in order to continue its business. Users must be able to have a necessary but industry-leading experience and continue to be ‘ constantly ’ within LG. However, he does not seem to appreciate his charm yet. It is regrettable that there is no differentiation strategy between the 6, 300, and flagship products.LG Electronics Inc. recently reorganized its mobile communication division and appointed Hwang Jeong-hwan, vice president of the world`s first dual-core smartphone Optimus 2x. Based on this, let's see if we can successfully reverse the mood next year.Returning to the operating system of Blackberry Android, which has entered the domestic market, Blackberry launched its own version of the Blackberry Key Source, which has a unique physical keyboard. In the domestic market, the foreign Android phones only have tiny pies. Still, the company launched its first Android phone, the PRIVE, in Korea last year, followed by the key source. It is said that the Blackberry Quarty keyboard was suitable for Korea, but they also engraved with Korean letters separately. In addition, the company has reportedly set a price of 100,000 won cheaper than abroad. Blackberries are seen as a refreshing choice for the domestic Android phone market.When looking at artificial intelligence from smartphones, Google and Huaway to Android phones abroad, the word ' AI ' was noticeable. Google and Huaway considered ways to improve the user experience by using AI in smartphones.Google has released a case directly using pixel cameras to explain how AI software can operate on the hardware. It is intended to show the synergy effects of hardware and AI software. Meanwhile, Whaway chose to maximize the efficiency of her smartphone by combining AI with her hardware, a chipset. The use of AI in different ways is likely to be attributed to the difference in corporate characteristics between IT companies and manufacturers. AI Google's second smartphone, "" Pixe2, "" with its first big benchmark and overwhelming camera performance, was Google. This fall, Google unveiled two different types of pixels - pixel 2, which are different in size from last year, and pixel 2 XL, which is 6 in size. Pixelphone boasts faster, more powerful performance because it is optimized for Google's latest Android operating system. The most important thing about Pixe2 is that Google has applied AI machine running to its cameras.For example, pixel 2 can be ' created ' by software alone with the outsourcing capabilities implemented by two cameras by other manufacturers. It is not just imitating but the result itself is superb. In the DxO mark, famous for its optical equipment benchmark site, the camera with Pixe2 ranked first with 98 points in the mobile sector. The iPhone X came in second with 97 points. At a ' Made with Google ' live streaming event on November 28, Isaac Reynolds, pixel camera developer, said, "" Combining hardware with machine running capabilities could lead to further improvements in performance. ""If Google wanted the hardware and AI software to be "" synergy, "" which attached AI to mobile chipsets, Hwaway offered the hardware itself as AI. The chip set, which acts as the brain of a smartphone, is loaded with AI. Mate 10 has a neurelegrade processing unit (NPU) like Apple's A11 chipset for up to 25 times higher performance than the CPU and 50 times higher energy efficiency.For example, a camera on a mate 10 "" knows "" how to recognize a person, object, or landscape and "" optimizes "" the camera's settings when filming. When taking a picture, it checks whether the camera is being photographed, whether it is the flower it is being photographed by, and then prepares the photo mode accordingly.AI is also faster and more secure when applied to chipsets. Batteries can also be controlled efficiently. It is much more convenient because it aligns with the device user's pattern of behavior. That is why some say that starting with Huaway, the mobile AI chipsets can compete in the future.Richard Whaway, CEO, introduced the giraffe 970 in his IFA 2017 keynote speech, "" The ultimate goal of (Hwaway's) is to provide a substantial improvement in the intelligent experience of a new device, "" said 970.Kim In-kyung, Editorial Writer, (shippo@bloter.net)[]"
