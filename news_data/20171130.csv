Korea Times, 20.3. This blooming age is the average age of professional gamers in Korea. He usually makes his debut in his late teens and leaves the league before he is in his mid 20s. Former Starcraft 1 percent of gamers Lim Hong-kyu (23) did, too. Lim, who joined the 17-year-old SK Telecom T1 team, was 19 when he retired. Now, he is working as a ' Actionhongu ' for StarCraft on African TV. I can`t do anything else besides Starcraft, he said, explaining why I decided to turn to B.J. because I don`t have a good financial environment.According to e-sports industry on July 29, many professional gamers are flocking to private broadcasting platforms. Most of the players who lost their homes due to the dissolution of teams or termination of professional leagues chose B.J.After receiving the Best B.J. award, Im went through a lot. As a junior player, I received little attention, he said, I almost practiced like a machine and had a lot of stress in the minor league, but I enjoyed playing broadcasting comfortably. Being able to maintain a more stable income than when he was a player, he became a full-time B.J. In other words, there are 186 former pro gamers who are currently active in African television, Lim survived the fierce competition. Some look at the phenomenon of B.J. Chulling with bitterness. Though he is still young, support for him is insufficient to help him take on new challenges in various areas. According to the Korea Creative Content Agency (Han Kon-jin), the number of active gamers who chose B.J. as their career choice to retire was 30 percent (30.4 percent), and that of e-sports coaches and directors (34.9 percent) was second. The biggest problem that athletes worry about is also the opaque course problem (52.5 percent).As of this year, the number of players on the domestic professional game teams is 167, but it is much larger when it comes to the minors and trainees at the game. Industry estimates put the world at 350 million. Of these, few of them become e-sports coaching staff and continue their careers reliably. Among the first group, only those who are good at it are allowed, Lim said, adding, Most players pass by B.J. Still, it would be fortunate if he were guaranteed an active period as a player, but it would be impossible in reality. Professional gamers who make their debut at the age of 18.3 are expected to retire 27.9 years old on average. Although they want to play as athletes for about 10 years, only 4.1 percent of the Korean athletes are aged 25 to 26, and rarely over 27. Pro gamers are short on their prime, their prime is young, and it`s not uncommon for them to get badly educated so they have difficulty managing their post-retirement careers, an official at the agency said. The highest level of professional athlete's education is high school graduation (45.9 percent) and 31.1 percent of middle school graduates. "" It's not been long since we've established the perception of professional gamers as jobs that we haven't yet retired support centers or institutions.

Ahn (37) was a construction worker in Jangseong-gun, South Jeolla Province. A note came out of his jacket inside pocket. ' I'm sorry. I couldn't get out of gambling. So, do this choice.It was a short note. The police decided his death was a suicide. According to research, visiting Gangwon Land one year before his death was the cause of the tragedy. Since then, he has lost nearly 2.5 billion won traveling to and from the area. Ahn's death was confirmed as a clear cause and effect case of property waste and suicide. Police classify the cause of death with will or memo as ` a gambling suicide killer ` only when gambling is allowed. According to a recent report submitted by the Gangwon Police Agency to the National Assembly's office of Jin Sun-mi, 61 people have killed themselves in the office of Jeongseon Police Station in the past 10 years due to casino gambling. There are about six people per year on average. According to the Jeongseon Police Station, 54 people, including those who committed suicide last year, were found to have died in the jurisdiction. Among them, 21 are suicides. About 38,000 people were killed in the same district, while 14.2 people killed themselves and 5.5 people killed themselves. Compared to the national average of 6.0 people per 10,000 who committed suicide last year, and 2.5 people, both of them were more than doubled. Only one out of 21 people are classified as gambling suicides. Many of the other 20 suicides are estimated to be related to gambling, but the lack of clear evidence has resulted in a history of "" understudy. "" Most likely gambling is the reason why outsiders have killed themselves in debt and hardships, but most of the time it is not as separate as they are, said a police official. A sign on a gambling house running around Jeongseon-gun, Gangwon Land has been posted calling for a response to the suicide problem. Ha Joon-ho : About 20 days before Ahn's death, similar deaths occurred. A 44-year-old businessman was found dead at a motel in Sabuk-eup, Jeongseon-gun. What police investigations have shown is that in 2010, he requested a ban on his own entry to Gangwon Land. Unable to find any survivors, police completed an investigation, classifying it as a suicide for the missing. His death was not included in the gambling suicides. Choi's place of registration was Danggam-dong, Busan. The "" deaths of silence "" that government statistics fail to grasp have become no stranger to residents of Jeongseon-gun. A resident of Jeongseon-gun who met on July 8 said, The rumor that a gambler committed suicide in a nearby motel or car is heard if it is worth forgetting. A resident of Sabuk-eup, who has been running a pawnbroker for 15 years, said with a nonchalant look. "" Is it a knight who died in Jeongseon? I don't care if anyone outside of the area dies in this neighborhood. "" Local motels or public restrooms have "" sad practices. "" If the owner or guardian knocks on the door, open the door by force immediately. There was a man who tried to kill himself a few years ago at our motel, said Song, who runs a motel in Sabuk-eup. When I opened the door after not coming out for a while, I took some medicine and fell down, so I called 119 right away. Dosukja, a 69-year-old cousin of Jeongseon-gun, said, My brother and I met each other at casinos recently carried agricultural chemicals around, but I don`t see him recently. I think he's dead.

However, at least tens of thousands of people remained unexposed at the foot of Agung Volcano in northeastern Bali Island. Local authorities raised the volcano alert on the volcano to a "" danger "" Monday, but refused to evacuate all residents within an 8-10 ㎞-range crater radius. The area is known to have about 90,000 to 100,000 residents in 22 villages. Sutopo Four-Nugroho BNPB spokesman said, "" I don't understand how dangerous the situation is, or I couldn't blame you for destroying livestock that was a livelihood, and you couldn't leave home. "" Sutopo said yesterday afternoon, "" In fact, four kilometers of rock fell into the village from the crater of Agung volcano. "" However, people who immerse themselves in a volcanic mudflat caused by the downpour of rain are still more likely to experience a lack of safety near Agung Volcano. It is a kind of Hindu ritual.Korean correspondent Hwang Chul-hwan is Hindu, lying in a volcanic deposit box at Mount Agung in Indonesia on July 28. Hindus, who account for 83 % of Bali's population, consider the highest peak volcano on the island as sacred land and recognize it as a denial of recognition. Among them, Indonesian Volcano Geological Disaster Prevention Center (PVMBG) said the smoke column of Mount Agung has been reduced to around 2,000 meters from 3,000 meters. As a result, authorities reduced the aviation alert in the sky near Agung Volcano by one step from the highest level of ' red ' to ' orange '. However, PVMBG reported that the volcanic crater in Agung is continuously receiving flames caused by lava and producing a large quantity of ash due to eruption. Local authorities say the level of danger has dropped, but local residents are still at risk of being discriminated against. Meanwhile, Bali Eungurarae International Airport, which was closed for two days starting July 27, resumed operation at 2:28 p.m. the same day, but is not fully normalized because many airlines did not resume their operations immediately. Despite the renewed airport operation, some tourists are trying to make a detour by buses and ferries, concerned that the airport would be closed again due to changes in wind direction, among other things. To help, Indonesian officials are flying from Bali International Airport to Surabaya Juanda Airport on a temporary service. However, it did not uncommon for passengers to travel more than 20 hours between airports because of heavy rains caused by the monsoon season and traffic jams, so some foreigners were left off on a roundabout flight at Surabaya airport. hwangch@yna.co.kr ▶ Information and inquiry (click!) ▶ Coffee Starbucks for the 400 Minutes of Yonhap news channel [PG] Descriptive senior citizens ' families [Choi Ja-yoon] and senior citizens ' pension workers, who say they will not inherit the home mortgage loan office … "" In his fifties, when he was about to retire, he was nearly half of the workforce.

"▽ Loan conditions and forecast of change in stock location = 3 years or more, the long-term loan will be fixed rate and even existing borrowers will be able to change their loan strategies from 1st next month. As the rate of deposit will be busy, they will have to enjoy the benefits of low interest rate increase on this day ... Experts say it is wise to lend money at a fixed rate for longer periods of time and move deposits at a shorter time than one year.The Bank of Korea (BOK) started raising the key interest rate for home mortgage loans starting tomorrow with a quarter of a percentage point increase in the first six years and five months on July 30.What is affected immediately is the fixed rate of mortgage loans. Normally, the fixed rate of a commercial bank is set based on the five-year bond rate (fixed and floating rate after five-year). As a result, one of the five major commercial banks, Woori, and NHCF Bank is expected to see a fixed rate increase starting tomorrow. However, since the method of reflecting the mortgage has recently been different from the average (one) to the average (Shinhan and National Agricultural Cooperative Federation) on average (NACF), the interest rate increase level is likely to vary from bank to bank. KB Kookmin Bank said, "" Every Thursday, the closing price of its five-year treasury bond will determine the next week's interest rate.As the floating rate of mortgage loans, which exceeds 70 percent of the total lending rate, does not depend on the CoFIX (index of financing costs) announced by the Korea Federation of Banks on July 15, the Bank's interest rate hike will be made immediately on that day. But as the central bank rose last month as the market gained as it signals a strong rate hike, Copyx and floating rates have already risen nearly five percent.Interest rate hikes are inevitable, whether the fixed rate or the fluctuations of the fixed rate are the result of long-term loans. Moreover, the benchmark interest rate tends to go up continuously for a considerable time once it starts to rise. Generally, the advantage of fixed rate instruments over fluctuations in interest rate hikes is considered a form of "" formula. "" However, if the maturity of the loan is shorter than three years, the floating rate can be advantageous. The head of the Gold Club's private banking unit, KEB Hana Bank, said, "" If interest rates on floating rates are basically lower than fixed rates, then change the key rates by less than 0.5 % over the next three years. ""However, mortgage loans usually last five, 10 or 20 years. If the long-term loans were originally planned, it may be better to choose a flat rate before raising further. When you have finished choosing between floating and stationary type, you should choose the bank. As the rate cut varies according to various conditions, such as the main bank, payroll transfer, and credit card use, the sale of the products is required to a certain extent. Interest rates on online and non-faceted loans are lower at the same banks. When the government requests the products of a loan via the Internet, the Kookmin, Woori, Hana, and National Agricultural Cooperative Federation discount the rate by 0.1 percentage point more than it would apply at the window.▽ Change in borrowers now → Change to fixed = Existing floating rate borrowers do not have to pay down payment due soon due to the expiration of the other funds (fixed fee paid when they sign up earlier than the contract). Kim Eun-jung, head of Shinhan's percent-minute Center, said, If the existing floating rate of interest is at the beginning of the 2 % range, it would have been better to explain the floating rate for the time being, however, that the central bank's benchmark rate would have risen from 2 %.While the savings and savings accounts are to be briefly rolled out, as interest rates are on a low rate basis, as shown by the low interest rate at the rate of 1 percent, the pre-budgeting products are likely to grow stronger. As the interest rate increases steadily during the rate hikes, it is advisable to change the maturity of the deposit to enjoy a higher rate.Commercial banks plan to raise interest rates on their deposits as early as next month. Woori Bank will raise the rate of 18 installment savings accounts and 11 time deposit by up to 0.3 percentage points beginning on the first of next month, adding, Savings will reach as high as 2.1 percent a year and 4.7 percent a year. The public and the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (Nonghyup) bank will also raise interest rates on deposits starting next week. We are reviewing the date of the increase and the extent of the increase, said Shinhan and Hana Bank.If you want to invest in the stock and bond markets, the stock market is better than the bond market in the period of raising interest rates, experts agree. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. However, it is good to see a bank run fund or a high-level bond that can make a profit from the rate hikes rather than just avoiding bonds.Kang Areum, reporter saram@hankookilbo.com)bent) [Korean daily newspaper (hankookilbo.com), [No unauthorised reproduction and redistribution] indicates a recovery in the economy, and the settlement of the situation of the "" interest rate hikes in the Bank of Korea "" 1400 trillion won in household debt, and the increase of the U.S. interest rate in the first rate hike in December was followed by interest rate hikes in Korea and the pace of interest rates in Korea … "" The Monetary Policy Committee of the central bank raised the key interest rate to 1.50 percent on July 30. As the domestic economy has shown signs of recovery, it is believed that there is a good time to raise interest rates. The central bank`s Monetary Policy Committee held a general meeting at Samsung headquarters in Sejong-daero, Seoul, yesterday morning and set the annual key interest rate at 1.50 percent by raising the key interest rate by 0.25 percent. The key interest rate was adjusted 17 months after it dropped to an all-time low of 1.25 percent last June. It is the first time in six years and five months that an interest rate hike has occurred since June 2011. The rate hike is explained to have been driven by some relief in domestic demand, including sluggish consumption amid the nation`s export-driven economy. The report shows that the economy grew 1.4 percent in the third quarter, and that it has enough economic conditions to make it easier to raise interest rates this year.The recent closing of the "" Saad (High Level Antimissile Defense System) conflict "" with China has also had some effects on the Korean economy. Although the danger of North Korea's missile launch occurred right before the commission, it did not seem to be enough to reverse the rate hikes. Ahn Ji-hye, a reporter for the Bank of Korea, raised the key interest rate by 0.25 % to 1.50 % on July 30 for the first time in six years and five months.Household debt growth of approximately 1400 trillion won, or Hokma @Newsis.com., appears to have been a burden. As the economic recovery continues, the possibility of keeping interest rates tied up raised the possibility of further increasing the financial imbalance that is heavily indebted to households. Even if the interest rate is raised by 0.25 %, the threat of the household debt becoming insolvent is not high among the vulnerable. As the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) conference next month, it is also believed that there was a need for defense against the outflow of foreign investment funds. The central bank has raised the market forecast for rate hikes by a strong hint of interest rate hikes in the second half of the year. If the recovery continues, we can consider adjusting the degree of monetary loosening, BOK Gov. Lee Joo-yol hinted at a rate hike. The central bank`s Monetary Policy Bureau announced last month that it had raised interest rates by a minority by former Monetary Policy Committee Chairman Lee Il-hyung, and also backed up the monetary policy report that the Monetary Policy Committee passed in November to revise low growth rates. The market has made this month's rate hikes a given, with bond rates rising. In fact, 82 percent of the 100 respondents said they would raise the annual rate of 1.50 percent this month, even after the Korea Financial Investment Association surveyed 200 Korean debt holding and operating employees on July 28.Interest is on the increase rate and at what time as interest rates are expected to rise this month. Experts say the rate hikes will be slowed and that one or two more rate hikes next year is possible. Lee Joo-yeol, the Bank of Korea Governor, greets the Monetary Policy Committee meeting in November 2017 at the Bank of Korea in Seoul yesterday morning. Lee Chang-sun, a senior researcher at LG Economic Research Institute at taehoonlim@newsis.com said, "" The next rate hike is likely to be in the first and second half of next year, "" adding, "" If it is not due to an overheated economy or an economy that is in the current situation.

"- The Bank of Korea Governor Lee Joo-yeol holds the Monetary Policy Committee's plenary session at the central bank's headquarters in Seoul Monday morning. ▽ Photo = Korea Bank reporter Shin Tae-hyeon [Lee Dae-ri Kim Jung-nam] raised the key interest rate suddenly. It has been 6 years and 5 months since June 2011.The central bank held a general meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee Monday morning and announced that it would raise the key interest rate from 1.25 percent per year to 1.5 percent per annum. After reducing the number of shares to 1.25 percent from 1.5 percent in June last year, it froze for 15 months.The increase is the first time in six years and five months since June 2011 when the rate was 3.00 to 3.25 percent. The market was rather forward. As a result of a survey of 10 economists and financial experts conducted by the board, seven expected an increase.Lee called for a turnaround in June, calling for modest adjustments to the monetary loosening, and last month, the Monetary Policy Commission reached a minority opinion. Because of this, the mayor has accepted this month's increase as a given.The main reason for the blitz is the recovery. Economic growth is forecast to surpass 3 percent this year. It is the first time in three years that the ratio has been around since 2014 (3.3 percent).In particular, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) raised their forecast for this year by 3.2 percent.Using these measures, it is believed that the government has enough money to keep the key interest rate down in the event of a recession.We received strong signals from the Monetary Policy Committee last month and the conditions were met due to strong economic growth, said Cho Yong-koo, a senior researcher at Shinyoung Securities Co.The U.S. variables are also big. The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to raise next month. This results in 1.25 to 1.50 %. It is necessary to raise the rate this month in order to proactively prevent a possible reversal of interest rates between Seoul and Washington.A steady increase in household debt also contributed to the mounting pressure. The bank is burdened by the prolonged debt crisis, which has led to a sharp increase in the financial imbalance between households.Meanwhile, it is not yet clear whether Hahm Joon-ho, Il-hyeong and Cho Dong-cheol, Ko Seung-beom, and Yoon In-seok, the former member of the Monetary Policy Committee, have decided to raise them unanimously.Chairman Lee's remarks at a news conference after 11:00 a.m. are also of interest.

"The lowest unemployment rate in 17 years, zero 42 years is up 0.2 % for the first year. This is because with the revival of the U.S. economy, skilled engineers have become invaluable. The U.S. unemployment rate was 4.1 percent last month. It is the lowest level in 17 years. As such, wages should go up when supply and demand is tight in the labor market. It is a law of supply and demand that prices will rise if supply is limited to increase demand. That is not the reality. We don`t get a substantial wage increase, although it is hard to find someone, Brown told CNN. It is difficult to tell a customer to raise their product price under the "" Zero Inflation "" situation. In the first half of this year, the real wage in the United States was only 0.2 percent higher than that of last year. The nominal wage increase was 2.4 % reflecting inflation. Less than 3.5 % of the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) target (which has never been achieved in the past nine years), not just in the United States. Major industrialized nations such as Japan and the U.K. are suffering from wage problems that do not raise. In Japan, the unemployment rate in the first half of this year was 2.9 percent. The figure is enough to achieve full employment. Companies have even adopted more people to target them. However, the real wage increase was only 0.1 percent. UK unemployment is the lowest in 42 years since 1975, averaging 4.6 % in February and April this year. However, wage increases in March were 2.1 percent, just half of the 4 percent before the financial crisis. A low wage increase or no wage increase could cause chronic low-growth in the long run. Consumption is a factor in promoting economic growth. As wages go up, consumption increases. As a result, businesses can increase production and their profits can increase. Companies can then increase hiring or raise wages. This virtuous circle leads to economic growth. Low wages will cause sluggish consumption by lowering purchasing power, and sluggish consumption can discourage businesses from doing business and lead to a prolonged slump. Recent changes in the labor market in developed countries have shown a break in the link between unemployment and wages, the International Monetary Fund said. Unemployment and wage hikes mean the Phillips curve, which has been explained to be in reverse relationship, is no longer in working order. Graphites of unemployment (horizontal axis) and wage increase rates (vertical axis) over a period of time show an "" L "" shaped Phillips curve, which in recent developed countries lies flat in slope. How can we explain the stagnant situation with lower unemployment? Why don't wages go up when the demand for human resources increases? Will the economy continue to recover without raising wages? The Federal Reserve in San Francisco called this a "" wage rise riddle "" in its report last year. Recently, economists and policy makers have been looking for answers. Korea`s major unemployment rate has returned to levels before the financial crisis, but the rate of wage hikes fell to a lesser degree last month, the IMF said in its World Economic Outlook report. Most of the major industrialized countries, including the United States, Canada, France and Britain, have a slower nominal wage growth rate than 2007, the official said. One of the reasons behind this is the increase in part-time workers, the IMF said. As irregular workers such as temporary contract and flexible work have spread over the past few years, the number of hours worked and wages decreased at the same time. This is due to the diversification of employment patterns through work, family compatibility, participation in women's jobs, and technological advancement. Temporary or part-time workers continue to seek jobs to find full-time or full-time jobs. If the contract changes, they are willing to work for the same pay, which reduces incentive for higher wages. This includes the growing number of "" geekie economy "" workers working on short-term contracts via smartphone applications (apps). Companies such as Urber, Lodge-Commission Air-Vins and Dillivero, a food carrier, only employ as many workers as needed. Although it has the benefit of being able to work on a short basis during free time, it has recently been criticized for its low wages and lack of benefits. As working hours are falling, wages are being restrained from rising, the IMF said. At first glance, the unemployment rate appears to be falling and full of job training appears to be strong, but the quality of employment has worsened. This was called ' surface healing ' by the IMF. Professor Robert Barbera Jones of Hopkins University argues that the economy took a long time to recover. They say that the slow recovery prevented companies from rushing to hire more workers, which delayed the increase in wages. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), he said, "" I was not familiar with the high rate of unemployment in October 2009 when I was not used to dropping to 4 %, "" adding, "" I experienced a boom in the 1990s when I was not used to having a high unemployment rate. "" A decline in labor productivity is also a limiting factor in wage hikes. "" Increasing hourly output would attract businesses to raise wages, which, if they continue to suffer from the poor productivity rates they have seen in the past, would act as a deterrent, "" the IMF said. As of the fourth quarter of last year, labor productivity in the United States was about 90 percent of what it assumed was continued before the financial crisis, and 92 percent in the eurozone and Japan, respectively. Jared Bernstein, former chief economist of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, wrote in a Washington Post article that "" The low inflation has made it difficult for businesses to avoid raising prices easily, and so businesses have avoided increasing labor productivity. "" It is analyzed that the globalization of the economy is another reason. As trade increases and the global supply chain expands, one country's working market conditions affect the other's wage structure. "" It is hard for American workers to demand higher wages as low-paid countries ' labor forces take away U.S. manufacturing jobs, "" Bloomberg said. The loss of power in labor unions around the world also weakens the bargaining power of workers. According to the OECD, only 23 percent of British workers were members of unions last year. It is a sharp decline from 40 % in 1990. Germany's share of the same period has dropped from 31 percent to 18 percent. Changes in population structure could also have an effect. "" As low-cost new workers fill in the high-paid jobs of the baby boomer, the incentive for higher wages has weakened, "" the Federal Reserve said. In the post-crisis recession, the bench warmer workers entered the job market as the economy rallied, but remained on low wages, which in turn is holding back their overall wage hikes. `` Inflation is likely to remain low unless wages are raised to a sustainable level, '' the IMF said, "" and this should be noted by central banks that have begun to collect stimulus. "" The United States and the eurozone central banks have called it a "" mystery "" when prices have not risen, although they have laid down their money to recover. Inflation may be off target, but preparations are underway to shrink holdings and raise the key interest rate further in light of an economic rebound. Heat the U.S. presidential election and a low wages, Trump as a president that does not make up wages hot issue in the American president election last year and South Korea's presidential election. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton both spoke on pay raises and job opportunities. Clinton pledged to increase federal minimum wage to $ 12 per hour from $ 7.25 per hour and provide tax breaks for businesses that invest in large-off industries. Trump has pledged to raise minimum wage to $ 10 and bring manufacturing jobs abroad back to the United States. From 2009 to 2014, the GDP per capita of the United States increased by 13 %. Pay increased by 8.7 percent, but real wages remained at the 2000 level due to a 9.5 percent rise in prices. The manufacturing jobs lost 17 million.

Meanwhile, the Security Council resolutions have prohibited North Korea from launching ballistic missiles. China and Russia, as well as the United States, denounced North Korea's breach of its resolve and called for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. As all of the member states have been taking turns posting messages of condemnation against North Korea, no separate statements have been adopted. However, the solution once again identified the difference between the U.S. and China. U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nicky Hayley, reiterated his commitment to import crude oil, defining crude oil as the main force behind North Korea`s nuclear program. In particular, China, the main source of crude oil for North Korea, wants to play a larger role, he said. Donald Trump, the United States president, Xi Jinping (習近平) Chinese direct request for an end to the phone call with North Korean oil supplies, it reported. In other words, the Trump administration's perception was that stopping the North Korean regime's "" lifeline "" crude oil supply is the only way to curb nuclear and missile provocations. The export of refinery products was severely restricted under the North Korean Resolution 2375 adopted last September, but the supply of crude oil was frozen at the current level. China has not released statistics on the export of crude oil to North Korea. Reuters, however, quoted an industry source in April as saying that China is supplying 520,000 tons of crude oil annually to North Korea through its old pipeline. Russia is also a source of oil for North Korea. On the surface, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nicky Hayley, was enraged. We have made it a premise that wars are never pursued, but if they do occur, the North Korean regime will be completely destroyed. Don't make any mistakes, '' he warned outright. All U.N. members were asked to stop diplomatic and trade relations with North Korea, while limiting the North's qualifications as a member of the United Nations was cited as an option. But the whole idea seems to have been set on "" negotiating with the U.S. on crude oil embargo. "" China wants to play a larger role, Hailey said, citing the past cases of oil embargoes. We can do it in China. China stopped supplying crude oil to North Korea for three days in 2003, when North Korea returned to the negotiating table.China showed negative nuances to this first. China's junior ambassador to the United Nations, Wu Haitao, said, "" China has faithfully carried out the U.N. resolutions, and so the influence of sanctions on North Korea on our humanitarian activities has not been consistently compromised. "" Although the U.S. did not directly respond to the U.S. demand, the provision of crude oil to North Korea is interpreted as a way to shock not only the North Korean nuclear issue but also humanitarian aspects. The Russian ambassador to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenja, also reiterated his commitment to a two-story solution : North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations, and to suspend the Korea-U.S. joint exercise. jun@yna.co.kr"
"【 Sejong : New Scientist and reporter Baek Young-mi : Next year, the results of an evaluation on university basic capability will suggest reducing the quota of colleges from the bottom 40 percent to 20,000 by 2019. (Data = provided by the Education Ministry) photo@newsis.com The ministry is recommending that universities save 20,000 students from the National University of Education's general public capacity evaluation in 2018 by requiring voluntary improvement of basic capacity ; universities that will recommend universities to reduce their capacity by 20 % (The University of Foreign Affairs and Home Affairs) For the top 60 percent of universities that were selected as the top universities with the highest levels of autonomy, general financial support was provided, or the government's budget to operate universities on their own in 2019. The Education Ministry announced its basic plan yesterday to prepare for a sharp decline in the number of students in school age and a slowdown in growth potential in the Seoul Metropolitan Government building. According to the report, the Education Ministry will select the first stage of its capacity diagnosis for universities next year (Seomyung-Madae, Daegu, Kyungbuk and Chungchong provinces) to select 60 % or higher of universities with a regional balance. The university plans to comprehensively diagnose basic elements to provide quality education, such as education conditions, financial soundness, classroom and curriculum management, student support, and education performance. Autonomous University of Improvement is free to conduct general financial support programs with no restriction on where they are used. It is also excluded from the recommendation for reduction of the quota. The ministry will provide each university with data to analyze their diagnosis results so they can use them. The second-stage diagnosis (written or field) analyzes the university's sustainability, including major and liberal arts courses, community contributions, and financial stability, and adds together the results of the first and second stages to support the selection of colleges regardless of regions (Class I and financial support). Other colleges with capacity improvement equal to around 40 percent, except for self-reforming universities, and limited financial support universities are advised to reduce their quota. The quota of recommendations to reduce the quota is scheduled to be less than 20,000. The ministry said it accepted criticism that it focused on quantitative reform by encouraging all universities to reduce their quota levels, other than Grade A, as a result of its evaluation of restructuring. So far, the ministry has divided universities into six categories - A, B, C, D +, D - and E - in its assessment of university restructuring. Other universities except those with the highest level of ' A ' (self-reduction) were all eligible for quota reduction. Universities with capacity improvement are advised to reduce their quota, but universities with special purpose support can receive support from the Ministry of Education. Universities with limited financial support (type Ⅰ or II) receive a recommendation to reduce their quota and receive differential financial support. Universities of type I that need to improve their basic capabilities and streamline their operation are limited to some extent to support the government financially. Universities with a need for high-intensity restructuring can not receive any financial aid from the government. The ministry, however, decided to review a measure to revive losers at universities with superior primary and secondary diagnosis results to promote universities to universities with better autonomy. The ministry also changes the evaluation method from an evaluation by universities to an evaluation by indicators. One team (7 - 9 persons) used to evaluate all indicators of colleges and universities in the group, and each team (10 or less) was asked to diagnose only the indicators in charge of the diagnosis. The ministry will confirm the diagnosis method in December after hearing on August 1, and announce the final results in late August after first or second stages of diagnosis. Universities with limited financial support will be evaluated in 2020 to provide additional financial support to universities with improved financial support and to lift financial support restrictions. positive100@newsis.comAs we ignored the warning of provocation following the neglect of the special envoy, we have lost the authority to influence North Korea and expressed our opposition to China's decision to re-importing the second blueprint of the Chinese People's Republic of Korea, therefore, it is very unlikely that we will actively impose additional sanctions on China. In particular, less than two weeks after President Xi Jinping's special envoy visit, North Korea is preparing to hold a high-level meeting with the Communist Party of China and the world`s most ambitious communist state in which it is expected to hold a dialogue on North Korea.China is expressing strict concern and opposition to North Korea`s missile launch activities, China Foreign Ministry spokesman Gengkok told a weekly news briefing. At the same time, China strongly urged North Korea to abide by the Security Council resolution and stop acting to accelerate tension on the Korean Peninsula, he said, At the same time, I hope the countries involved will act with caution and keep peace with the local community.Beijing's diplomatic community noted that the North Korean provocation was carried out shortly after Xi's special envoy, Songtao, returned home empty-handed. North Korea is already far from the orbit of China, a source said, explaining that North Korea`s leader Kim Jong-un, the ruling Workers ` Party's chief, fired missiles immediately after questioning Xi ` envoy. Although Song did not meet Kim Jong-un, he reportedly met Choi Ryong-hae, vice chairman of the ruling Workers ` Party, and requested him to refrain from any nuclear or missile tests and come to the dialogue table. However, North Korea flatly rejected China's request due to the missile attack.After the North's provocation Songtao returned to Korea, the North's top diplomat raised the card of resuming the six-party talks once again. It is clear that not only did North Korea kick China's proposal for a dual team (North Korea's nuclear and missile halt), but also the U.S. and South Korea's military drills are likely to be tougher on North Korea. In addition, the U.S. is expected to demand China to impose strict sanctions against North Korea.China, which has responded to the U.S. call for tougher sanctions, is likely to become clearer in the future. In fact, China has restricted travel to North Korea to South Korean groups, which had been banned since July 28. The North Koreans, who live in the North and China provinces, were allowed to travel to the North, but Beijing imposed sanctions on Beijing. In view of this, China is most likely to join the U.N. Security Council's further sanctions on North Korea.In particular, China will hold "" high-level talks with the Communist Party of China and the world political parties "" from July 30 to July 1. It is an important event to inform leaders of around 200 political parties of the blueprints of the second phase of President Xi Jinping's term, which was prepared during last month's ruling party meeting, and North Korea has again re-sponsored it. North Korea may invite Vice Foreign Minister Ji Jae-ryong to the event instead of inviting delegates to the event.Beijing correspondent Lee Chang-gu window2@seoul.co.kr"
"North Korea to Distinguish from Use of the "" Hwasong-15 "" Missile-Split Missile (ICP-2011) test, which North Korea disclosed in its May 29 Rodong Sinmun newspaper. North Korea launched a new anti-North Korean Central News Agency ballistic missile (ICK) in early July 29. According to the Rodong Sinmun ' homepage on July 30, North Korea printed 40 photographs including preparation for the launch of the "" Hwasung-15 "" newspaper and the presence of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The dark surroundings included photographs of the Samsung-15 missile floating up in a red flame, pictures from a 9-axis mobile launch vehicle (TEL), and pictures of it lifting vertically. North Korea announced in a news release yesterday that it had developed a "" North Korean nuclear missile, "" a nine-and-a-half missile launch vehicle developed by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and a confidence-turned-onery missile launch system led by North Korea`s head Kim Jong Un. Photographs of North Korean Workers ' Party Chairman Kim Jong-un, who examines Mars-15-type missiles, is to be redistributed only [available locally]. The ' Hwasong-15 ' rocket, the first of its kind to be launched last July, is a prototype for the upper part of the rocket, completely different from the upper part of the ' Hwasong-15 ' nuclear rocket. The missile's fuselage of the Type 9-5 nuclear vehicle appears longer than the Type 8-axis vehicle, the Hwason-14. Other examples were revealed, such as the sight of Chairman Kim staring into the sky, shouting with the launch officials, and watching a monitor that shows the launch in real time. The Rodong Sinmun, the official daily of the North Korean Workers ` Party, printed a government statement on the front page concerning the launch of the Hwasung-15, a command document to fire Kim Jong-un, and a photo of his autograph. The Rodong Sinmun, the official daily of the Workers ' Party, was published Monday on its website. North Korea revealed several photos related to the launch of the Mars-15-type missile on July 30, including Kim Jong-un's fist right after the launch, through the North`s Central News Agency.North Korean Central News Agency reported on July 29 that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un successfully launched the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICP-15), which ordered the missile to be launched by hand.

The most expensive surgical procedure was heart surgery, which cost 2.94 million won.The National Health Insurance Corporation analyzed a total of 33 major surgeries, and among the 173,355 major surgeries performed during 2016, 516,633 were cataracts. Next on the list were dental surgery procedures (199,949 cases), C-section 177,155 cases, and general spinal surgery (168,8836 cases).The number of surgeries performed per 100,000 people rose 5.4 percent over the past five years from 3,154 in 2011 to 3,3431 in 2016. The largest number of operations per 100,000 people was cataracts (992). In particular, the number of cases rose 18 percent from 841 in 2011. Since then, 652 C-section and 381 hemorrhoidectomy operations were performed. Compared to 2011, endoscopy and percutaneous biliary surgeries (45.7 %), knee replacement surgeries (36.6 %), and cholecystectomy (33.9 %) were the most significantly increased in 2016. In contrast, thyroid surgery (- 33.9 %) was the biggest decline during the same period. Since then, the results have been followed by dental hemorrhoidectomy (- 12.6 percent) and hysterectomy (- 10.1 percent). The number of major operations differed significantly by age group. Tolentones under 9 (50.3 %), appendectomy (41.3 %), and caesarectomy (54.1 % in 20s and 30s respectively) were C-section surgeries (28.8 % and 54.8 % in their 20s and 30s respectively). The proportion of cataract operations includes those in their 50s (21.8 percent), 60s (37.4 percent), 70s (46.6 percent), and 80s (40.1 percent) and above.Surgery for each surgery cost 2.94 million won (excluding coronary artery bypass). It was followed by coronary artery bypass surgery (26.56 million won) and basal surgery (14.75 million won).Low cost surgery was dental hemorrhoidectomy (900,000 won), cataract surgery (950,000 won), and tonsillectomy (1,040,000 won). Last year, the average cost per operation was 2.44 million won per operation. The number of surgeries performed by the medical institutions in other regions away from where patients live was 23.8 % (426,000). There were many other regions of the globe, including the basal surgery (63.9 % of the cases involved), the cleft palate and the heart catheter insertion (59.2 %). Surgery in residential areas was found to be 85.8 percent, hemorrhoidectomy (84.0 percent), and cesarean sections (82.9 percent).

Kim Ji-seon!Images showing the Mars 15 launch?Q : North Korea released photographs of its new Mars 15-shaped launch this morning, and then released video just before that.It looks like a new missile, not an upgraded version because it looks very different from the Martian type 14.The diameter of the top two stages is about the same as the diameter of the first stage rocket, so it looks like a cylinder at first sight and has a firmer end.The JCS analysis shows that Mars 15-type warheads have clearly different appearances and connections in the first and second tiers than Mars type 14.Experts say North Korea has once upgraded its second-stage engine of the 14-stage Mars model, boosting its momentum.Another possibility is that the first stage of Mars ' 14th type, the Baekdu Mountain engine, was built with two engines on it.The JCS has revised its initial analysis that it sees the planet as a new missile, with what it sees as an improvement on the planet's 14th.The mobile launch pad vehicles have grown.Mars 14 was launched from an eight-wheeled eight-wheeled eight-wheeled vehicle, this time nine on one axle and eighteen on the other.Anchorwon : Kim Jung-un directed the launch?[Q : Kim Jong-un also took command of the missile launch and showed up.As it was dark around, he saw a missile going up to the sky, stared back from the ground, looked at the launch vehicle, hugged by officials and cheered.It is also possible that the missile launch was in a bit of a hurry to be unveiled.North Korea usually reports on the day after the launch, but this time it issued an unusually important report, although it was early morning.But the major news report didn't show any footage or photos of Kim Jong-il guiding the missile launch, and it wasn't until very recently that they were released.The photographs released this morning were also published in yesterday's paper.Some say the North is anxious to report the news of type 15 on Mars as soon as possible.Kim Jong Un's hurry to declare the completion of nuclear weapons is apparently trying to set the stage for dialogue or negotiation to change the situation under pressure from sanctions.So far, the Defense Ministry has been YTN Kim Jiseon.▶ Subscribing to YTN news station on Naver.

According to the authorities on April 30, the Seoul Central District Public Prosecutors ' Office spent a large sum of money investigating whether the National Intelligence Service decorated the top floor of the I-Building building as residential. Prosecutors secured statements from NIS budget officials, including the head of the prosecution, that they conducted interior construction on the top floor of the I-Building at the instruction of Won`s former head officer, and received furniture and other high-end furniture. After the construction, the luxury interior of the house was first used for personal reasons, such as a meeting with friends of a former head of state. Prosecutors reportedly found out that the NIS budget, which is close to one billion won, was executed only to purchase interior decoration and furniture based on internal data from the NIS. The 5-story, 18-story, underground building near Tower Palace, a luxury multipurpose building, is owned by the National Intelligence Service. One story is 823 ㎡ in area. The National Security Strategy Research Institute, a state-run think tank under the NIS, currently uses the 12th to 18th floors of the building and rents the rest of the building to businesses and offices. Prosecutors said the NIS removed the removal work and removed high-end furniture from the building when some media reported in August 2011 that the former chairman's family was using the building safe. The NIS told the media at the time (Won) that it was during repair work at Naegok-dong's old official residence that it was temporarily placed in a building in Dogok-dong that had not been used before. However, if the prosecution, despite the explanation, suspects that Won has a separate official residence to live a normal life and can make a huge amount of money for his wife's private use, it is in the process of embezzlement or misappropriation. Prosecutors are also investigating whether the former chairman, Dogok-dong Angagama, with expensive furniture, is making a strong request and that his wife is questioning him for questioning as an accomplice. Prosecutors were also confirmed to have included luxury interior suspicions in Won`s search and seizure warrants when they searched the National Security Strategy Institute and Won`s rescue team. Meanwhile, the prosecution is investigating data that Won sent $ 2 million worth of overseas donations from the National Intelligence Service to the fund of a research center at Stanford University from late 2011 to early 2012. Prosecutors suspect that former head of the NIS planned to become a guest researcher at Stanford University after leaving office in 2013, and made him contribute money in advance to secure a seat. cha@yna.co.kr"
"▽ Combined household debt (CG) [Yonhap news TV] The Bank of Korea raised the mortgage rate by 400 won in the first 6 years and five months, which means that households with high-risk households can not pay their debts by 1 percentage point. If the immediate base rate increase is reflected in lending rates, the rising interest burden on households will likely exceed 2.3 trillion won.The debt-equipped debtor (PG) [Manufacturing Jo Hae-in] will face a household credit rating of 341 trillion won (139.9 billion won) in the third quarter of this year when lending rates rose by 0.25 trillion won to reflect the base rate increase. Considering that the floating rate of the bank's lending rate is 65.8 percent, the bank estimated that the floating rate of non-bank loans is similar to that of deposit banks. Considering the National Statistical Office's estimate of households this year (195.92 million), Korea's household debt per household is 76.9 million won and its increased interest burden per household is 181,725 won. It is the first time this year that Korea`s household debt has exceeded 70 million won. The monetary policy direction itself is set to reduce the easing trend, but there are many factors to consider, said Bank of Korea Governor Lee Joo-yeol at a news briefing, saying, Raising the rate will increase asset prices and help households pay back their debts. Korea`s household debt more than doubled in nearly a decade from 665 trillion won at the end of 2007. In particular, the number of mortgage loan regulations, such as LTV (Housing Mortgage Recognition Rate) and DTI (Gross Debt-Debt-Deception Rate), jumped nearly 10 % per annum amid low interest rates. The annual average increase was much greater than 7.4 % in 2008 and 2013. Amid such a sharp increase in household debt, if the rate hikes starts with the rate hike, the delinquency rate becomes centered on the high-risk households and this could lead to financial mismanagement.When the Bank of Korea analyzes household debt data from the 2016 financial welfare surveys, the total debt of households accounted for 126 percent of households with total debt as of the end of March last year, which could be debt-loss. Their financial debt amounts to 186.7 trillion won, or 21.1 percent of their total financial debt. High-risk households with a capacity to repay debt despite selling their assets amounted to 315,000 households, or 2.9 percent of all households with debt, and the total debt of them was tallied at 62 trillion won, or 7.0 percent.The problem with the illustration of household debt risk spikes (PG) [Manufacturing Assistant] is that when the rate hikes is made in earnest, the number of high-risk households who can not repay their debt could grow. The central bank said, "" If the loan rate increases by 0.5 percentage point (p) and 1 percentage point (p), the number of high-risk households will increase by 8,000 and 25,000 respectively. "" Under the scenario, the financial debt of high-risk households is estimated to grow 4.7 trillion won and 2.2 trillion won, respectively. In addition, it is forecast that if the loan rate rises by 1.5 %, high-risk households will see an increase of 60,000 households (19.0 %) and the financial debt of those households will grow by 13.6 trillion won. A sharp rise in interest rates in the short term would significantly increase the number and debt of high-risk households and increase the vulnerability of household debt, the bank said. Hyundai Economic Research Institute also released a report in May, saying that the average annual interest rate for households with financial debts will rise by 1 percentage point to 1.46 million won, up from 3.08 million won, with households with a limit of 8.32 million won.Lee Jeong-hoon (Yonhap News Agency), announced the comprehensive household debt plan at the Seoul Regional Government Office yesterday. It is noteworthy whether the comprehensive household debt measures announced last month by the government at uwg806@yna.co.kr'/> The government announced measures to follow up on household debt, which are aimed at reducing the loan-to-value mortgage rates for multiple home owners by introducing a new DTI (New DTI) unit from next year. The goal is to curb mortgage loans by self-employed people, lending by businesses in the two regions, and collective lending to households within 8 percent. Household debt growth in the first three quarters of this year was 9.5 percent compared to last year's 104.5 trillion won. A modest decline in double-digit growth was made, but they still fell short of their target. The government earlier announced comprehensive measures to curb household debt, adding that as of the end of last year, the household debt account for nearly half of the total household debt of 134.3 trillion won was uncertain. That means households with such debts do not have sufficient income or assets to repay their debt. In addition, he judged that 100 trillion won of these funds were already insolvent, making it impossible for him to pay the prize. The government, in particular, pointed out that 320,000 households with 94 trillion won in total household debt are feared to suffer insolvency as they lack the ability to repay income and assets. yulsid@yna.co.kr ▶ Information on the International News Agency (click!) ▶ Starbucks Coffee for the 400 minutes of subscription to Yonhap News Channel → News 1. North Korea's control limits imposed by North Korea as a Continental Bank designer and possible missile strikes against North Korea will be aggravated … "", U.S. reporter Chung Eun-jin, and U.S. nuclear exports to Xi Jinping will stopIn particular, China's control over North Korea, which had a relatively strong influence on North Korea, is exposed, therefore, it is also drawing attention that the possibility of stopping the supply of crude oil to the North is also being raised.The U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting to discuss the North's provocations at the request of South Korea, the United States and Japan on July 29 (local time). In the past two months when North Korea refrained from provocation, the U.S. warned that it would accept the missile test as a communication signal if North Korea suspended it for 60 days, and Russia also took an active step toward mediating on its nuclear program.In China, a special envoy of Chinese President Xi Jinping visited North Korea to discuss ways to solve the North Korean nuclear issue. But North Korea chose to take the Miway route, launching a new Hwasong-15 in about two months and declaring the completion of its nuclear weapons program. The international community is forced to speed up its efforts to stop North Korea from developing nuclear missiles.The international community is likely to discuss the first issue of North Korea's blocking of its "" money lines. ""Under the present circumstances, the cards available to North Korea are very limited. Some sanctions have so far been taken with greater symbolism than effectiveness.North Korea has adopted a resolution to impose sanctions on the North on it in three separate occasions this year, including nuclear tests and an IRC (International Space Council) missile launch, and a middle-range missile launch into Japan. The U.S. has implemented its own sanctions seven times, and has recently re-designated North Korea as a sponsor of terrorism after nine years.China and Russia, which have been passive in enforcing sanctions against North Korea, have also announced measures to import coal, hire workers, and stop cooperating with North Korean companies.The strongest and most probable measure each country can take in one situation is the suspension of North Korea's oil imports. China's role is most crucial in carrying out this. In a related, Donald Trump reportedly demanding an end to the oil supplies to North Korea to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping is president. Nikki Haley, according to the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Trump The president stopped in 2003 is in a telephone conversation that China crude oil supplies and soon North Korea negotiations.We came to the table and said such demands.That is why interest is focused on whether China will accept the demand or at what level. China's decision is quite substantial, however less influential it might be, because the North Korean economy is up to 90 percent dependent on it.However, the U.S. demand that Korea impose a complete ban on crude oil imports is unlikely. Instead, it is likely to take steps to control North Korea's coal exports.If China and the United States disagree over an oil embargo, it is also possible that the United States could put more pressure on Chinese businesses dealing with North Korea by directly imposing sanctions against them.

The head of the institute added that it would not be possible to determine whether the tissue of the body, such as the lungs, was examined and whether the bones were contaminated with toxins, only adding that no fractures or damage was seen. The head of the national team will investigate whether the injured woman was buried in the ground alive and whether or not the substance of sleeping pills is present. Precision emotion is expected to take about a month longer. Police earlier sought arrest warrants for an aunt (55 years old, female) and her son, Park (25), on charges of murder and dumping her body. Lee and others are accused of taking sleeping pills to drink coffee from a rental car of a friend of mine on July 14, and then dying in a garden parking lot of a man named Park Jae-seong (62. Lee was found guilty of such a crime in June last year when he was caught as a thief when he was asked to enter his old brother's house and was found guilty of stealing what he owned.

It says, ' Use your courage for your party and your country. ' ▽ Capture of the North Korean Central TV station Kim Jong-un's "" Great victory of the people of Korea, "" meaning the declaration of the completion of the North's nuclear weapons declaration, and the warning message of reasserting the U.S. anti-ballistic state of terrorism was issued at the end of July 29. It is interpreted that when the U.S. turned to a hard-line stance against North Korea, such as reassigning the U.S. sponsor of terrorism, it issued a warning against the U.S. again. North Korea is expected to declare a war with a nuclear warhead by early next year and strongly ask for direct talks with the United States to formulate its status as a nuclear power. North Korea is likely to launch an additional 15 types of Mars. North Korea claimed the launch was "" a test launch. "" This implies that there is still time before the actual battle. North Korea announced a power transfer in September, four months after it launched its first medium range ballistic missile, Type 12 on Mars. In particular, the second and third type of the Hwasung 12 tests, made between August and September, were conducted promptly (last year's 30-45 degree) under the actual conditions. The missile went over Japan and landed in the Pacific Ocean. North Korea then disclosed the results of the launch and used the term "" firing drills "", not "" test-firings. "" Following the roadmap, North Korea is expected to make similar provocations with ICP-class ICP-class missiles such as Type 14 and Type 15. North Korea called its nuclear and missile development "" to defend its sovereignty and territory from the U.S. nuclear ambitions and nuclear threats and to defend the peaceful lives of its people. "" North Korea is expected to blame the U.S.-led talks on additional sanctions on the North, calling them a "" control-shy scheme, "" and justify further provocations. North Korea's provocations are intended to boost the accumulation of technology in the completion of the ICBMs. At the same time, it can be seen as a reaction to the U.S.'s passive attitude toward dialogue and increased pressure on the North. This means that the North has found a way out of worsening economic conditions due to additional sanctions by the international community. We regard it as an attempt to solidify the system and to use it as a means to pressure the U.S. negotiations, the Joint Chiefs of Staff said. Labor Party Chairman Kim Jong-un said in an unceasingly familiar manner, "" The stellar performance that takes place in defense science and all sectors of the nation is the result of the North Korea`s translational and science-oriented policies chosen by the Korean Workers ` Party. "" It is the first time that Kim has said that he will complete the country`s nuclear weapons program since 2012. North Korea insisted it tested a hydrogen bomb for installing ICPs in its sixth nuclear test in September, but said it was only a very significant opportunity to reach the completion goal of its nuclear weapons program. It is too early to say that they have actually completed the nuclear weapons program, said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean Studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. Some say that since North Korea announced its completion of its nuclear weapons program, it will try to change the situation by concentrating more on dialogue rather than provocation. North Korea said Kim`s map of the 15 types of tests was done at the request of the Korean Workers ` Party and the Republic of Korea government. It is quite unusual for the North Korean leader to write an expression that he received a ' delegation ' from the ruling party and the government.

The Honam high-speed railway opened its Songjeong section between Osong and Gwangju in 2015 according to the phase-operated plan, but projects were delayed due to delay in negotiations on the route. However, as the suitability of the Korea Development Institute's (KDI) project was reviewed and the route to the airport is decided, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport is determined to make sure that it will open by 2025. The route setting completes the high-speed rail network on the nation`s two largest transportation services - the Cheongbuk-Namdo Line - and will greatly help balance the nation by creating growth engines, ministry officials said. ◇ Ministry of Finance and Economy also decided that the route to Muan is appropriate, deputy prime minister and Strategy and Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon recently concluded that the route was appropriate when it comes to Muan, a second-stage airport in the Honam region. At the plenary session of the National Assembly's planning and finance committee, Kim stated, "" The ruling party and the people's party agreed on a two-stage route to Muan, the Grand National Party (GNP), and asked whether they would respond to this proposal. Kim said, "" I asked the Korea Development Institute for services last summer, and recently I have obtained results from them.

It will cost the company 7.8 billion won.The remainder of the route, from Mokdongwon to Mokpo, has been delayed for the past 10 years without the government making any decision on whether to re-appropriate the route.As the government decides to go via Muan airport, the related projects are expected to be expanded to cover next year's budget.Jeonnam Province requested 300 billion won for next year's budget to build the second stage of the Honam railway, but only 14.5 billion won was reflected in the government's budget.Jeonnam Province expects the airport to become a hub airport in the southwestern region and improve its competitiveness in the innovative cities as well as the balanced development of the nation when the airport is completed early.In addition, traffic networks will increase as more people visit Jeonnam Province and the local economy will become more active when combined with the construction of Heuksan Airport."
"Hwang Jeong-hwan, Vice President of MC Business, appointed by Hwang Jung-hwan … Chairman of Smart Phone Business Chairman Cho Joon-ho, Samsung Electronics ' 30 strategy phones were sluggish in the first quarter from G4 until the second half of 2017. Although Samsung's forecast was gloomy, Samsung's mobile phone business forecast was not nearly 200 million won. LG Electronics announced on July 30 that it would appoint Vice President Hwang Jung-hwan to head its new mobile communications division. Cho Joon-ho, former head of the MC business department, was appointed LG Inhwa chairman.LG Electronics ` MC division posted a deficit for the 10th consecutive quarter since the second fiscal quarter of 2015 due to poor performance of smartphones, which lasted from G4 (the first half of 2015) to ES30 (the second half of 2017). Last year, the company suffered huge losses such as 2022 billion won in the first quarter, 153.5 billion won in the second quarter, 436.4 billion won in the third quarter and 467 billion won in the fourth. It was evaluated that the company`s operating loss in the first quarter was only 200 million won, setting a stage for a turnaround, but it was once again revised down with a loss of 134.4 billion won in the second quarter. The third quarter also suffered a loss of 375.3 billion won. The outlook for the fourth quarter is also bleak.

The Monetary Policy Committee raised the key interest rate by 0.25 % to 1.50 % from 1.25 %. Lee Joo-yeol, the governor of the Bank of Korea, raised the key interest rate for the first time since taking office. The central bank will raise the key interest rate by 0.25 percentage point from 1.25 percent per year to 1.50 percent per year at its main building in Seoul. The rate increase is the first time since June 2011. Considering that Lee Joo-yeol took office in April 2014, it is also the first impression of Lee. In the beginning of their tenure, the presidents of Lee Seong-tae (April 2006 - March 2010) and Kim Joong-su (April 2010 - March 2014) raised the key interest rate five times. Since his inauguration, the domestic and international economy has been forced to cut interest rates. Economic recovery was unsatisfactory, and externally, the currency war spread. The central bank cut its key interest rate in August 2014 for the first time since Lee took office, from 2.50 percent to 2.25 percent per year. At that time, the domestic economy froze rapidly after the Sewol accident, but it was not until August when it was criticized that it was too late to respond by lowering the key interest rate. Since then, the central bank has cut its key interest rate again by 0.25 % (2.25 % → 2.00 %) in October 2014, and again lowered its key interest rate by 1.75 % (2015-2015). The first one percent era in the history of the key interest rate has opened. By the end of May 2015, the MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) parameter had protoned. The central bank lowered the benchmark interest rate by 0.25 % (1.75 % - 1.50 %) in June. Last year, as the restructuring of the shipbuilding and shipping industries cast dark clouds over the Korean economy, it slashed the key interest rate by an additional 0.25 % in June. In other words, the bank lowered the key interest rate by 1.25 percentage points five times in two years and two months since Lee took office. Interest rates fell to an all-time low of 1.25 percent per year. In the process, Lee was embroiled in controversy and criticism. The comment, made by then deputy prime minister and then finance minister Choi Kyung-hwan in September 2014, stirred controversy over the bank`s independence. As liquidity flowed into the real estate market after falling to an all-time low, Lee was criticized for contributing to the surge in household debt. Bank of Korea Governor Lee Joo-yeol holds the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of Korea's Samsung Main Building in Seoul Monday morning. It was five months ago when Lee's lips detected a shift in the Monetary Policy Committee's decision to reduce or freeze the key interest rate for seven months at superdoo82@yna.co.kr3 Lee said at a ceremony marking the bank`s founding in June that the possibility should be reviewed carefully, as a more clear improvement in the economy, such as the continuing recovery, would require adjustments to ease monetary policy. It was the first time Lee, who had cut the benchmark rate five times since he took office, turned on his ' blinkers ' that warned the market of an increase. Since then, the conditions for interest rate hikes have matured. Exports of semiconductors continued to grow, and facility investment grew in tandem. The Federal Reserve (Fed), the central bank of the United States, raised its policy rate in June, following the FOMC in March. Last month, the Monetary Policy Committee (FSC) stated one of its members had raised the rate by a few points, and two others said they needed to raise it soon. Since then, the GDP growth rate in the third quarter of this year has been estimated to be higher than forecast of 1.4 percent, which makes it a given that the growth rate will grow by 3 percent this year. Earlier this month, even neutral Financial Supervisory Service Commissioner Hahm Joon-ho told reporters at a news conference that the central bank was about to raise the key interest rate. In the end, Lee raised the key interest rate for the first time with four months left in office. Now the question is whether Lee will raise the key interest rate again during his term. He will head the Monetary Policy Decision Meeting only twice on January 18 and February 27 next year. If the rate is raised again, Lee will go back to the path of former presidents Lee Seong-tae and Kim Joong-soo. Former two presidents Lee Seong-tae and Kim Joong-soo raised interest rates five times in a row in the early part of their term of office, and lowered them six to three times. However, some analyze that Lee might not raise his presidency any further because he was opposed to raising the benchmark interest rate and the Bank of Korea (BOK) indicating that he would speed up the rate. Whether to make further adjustments to the extent of easing the situation will be carefully determined by carefully checking the underlying trend of growth and price, Lee told a news conference after the commission. porque@yna.co.kr"
"The Great Museum outside Cairo, the Great Pyramid of Kufu and the Great Egyptian Museum under construction in the media area outside Cairo. As the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities (GEM) officially entered the media section of the Egyptian capital Cairo on July 19, a towering pyramid emerged. By the time they reached the pyramids of the Egyptian three Great Pyramid, including the Great Pyramid of Kufu, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, a construction site was opened. The Egyptian government began construction in 2002 and is in the process of constructing the Grand Egyptian Museum, which will open in the second half of next year. The view of the museum looked like an elongated staircase leading to the pyramid. The building itself was magnificent, but the entire view from a distance made its mouth water. The site of the museum is 490,000 square meters, which is about 70 times larger than the soccer field. It is much larger than the Louvre Museum in Paris, France (162,150 square meters). The three pyramids in Egypt are visible through a glass outer wall in the museum's exhibition room. The linear distance between the museum and the pyramid is only two kilometers. The opening of the museum will allow visitors to tour the pyramid in one day using carts or carriages, said Islamic museum's technical director and media manager, with expectations of at least 10,000 visitors per day. The museum's collection of Tutankhamun, or the Boy Pharaoh, has drawn global attention. Although around 5,000 Tutankhamun burial goods were excavated in 1922, most of them were lost due to the exhibition space at the Takhrir National Museum in Cairo. The museum will have its own exhibition room measuring 7,000 square meters and will display all of its collections, including Tutankhamen's Golden Mask, regarded as Egypt's best treasure. Tutankhamun's Mirah is also being moved here and his final resting place is to be recreated in nearly 100 years. The Egyptian government is speeding up its opening of the museum. Currently, 4,000 workers take turns working day and night shifts at the construction site, and 200 researchers were busy managing the new exhibits at the conservation center. 42,000 artifacts have already been moved to the museum and 30,000 items will be revealed when the doors are opened. The total construction cost of the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities is estimated to be one billion dollars (approximately 1.08 trillion won). Egypt, which has received rescue loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) since a year ago, can not afford it. However, the Egyptian government borrowed 75 percent of the construction costs from Japan. They saw reviving the Egyptian tourism industry as the key to reviving the sluggish economy. Egypt has become unstable since the Arab Spring in 2011. Since the establishment of the Islamic branch office in Egypt in 2014, the country has been suffering frequent terrorist attacks. In addition, the number of MERS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome, has decreased significantly the Egyptian tourism industry. Last year, Egypt's tourism income decreased to $ 3.8 billion, one-third of that of 2010 ($ 12.5 billion). Artris Abu Shaima, who drives a wagon in the Great Pyramid of Giza, said, "" We've seen a reduction in the number of tourists per day from nearly 30,000 to just 5,000. "" The museum is ready to open again. Traffic, hotels and catering infrastructure are also being activated, said Tarek Sayed Taufik, director of the museum, saying the museum is likely to see a sharp decline in tourism revenue over the next few years.Cairo : Correspondent Park Min-Woo minwoo@donga.com U.S. State Department correspondent Kim Hyo-jung said, "" The U.S. could have attacked North Korea by a massive intercontinental ballistic missile (ICP-15) on July 30.

Students rushed into the school building, which is full of evidence of building reinforcements, and as the number of absent students approached 100, criticism is rising over the hasty safety measures taken by schools under repair.Students entered the school at 8:10 a.m. and paused at a safety fence surrounding the school building. Some of the buildings had cracks in some bricks and exposed metal frames by falling concrete and finishing materials. Students who entered the building across the playground looked around as they entered the classroom.

"" A student at the Pohang City Hall said, I don`t know why it is so important to consider sending his students to school in the same place when the schools were distributed to safe nearby schools.We were unable to distribute the materials because of the damage to nearby Changpo Elementary School and Dohoo Elementary School buildings, and despite the fact that they were apparently damaged, the structure was also found to be safe, according to officials at Pohang University of Education, expressing concern over the students ` voices.The school said it would not deal with the absence of students until July 15, even if they don`t attend class due to the lack of safety measures, adding, We will not deal with the problem until July 15.

SBS's own news on Tuesday : ※ SBS & SBS's I&M. ; "" Don't be allowed to reproduce and redistribute illegally in Seoul next year "" : "" The speed of interest rate hikes, the rate of growth and the price increase of Korean banks, "" and "" the exchange rate of interest rate and interest rate hikes are hard to predict. However, he argued about the speed of the rate hikes in the future. If the Monetary Policy Committee raises the key interest rate to 1.50 percent next year, it will show strong growth, said Lee at a news conference, adding that the semiconductor exports will grow at an alarming rate and the pace of the nation`s fourth industrial revolution.The economy grew 1.4 percent in the third quarter of this year, making it easy to achieve an annual growth rate of 3.0 percent, and the analysis shows that the growth rate will continue next year. The central bank`s forecast for next year`s economic growth last month was 2.9 percent.As to the rate hikes, I will make careful decisions as I closely examine the fundamentals of the growth and price trends, said Lee, who headed toward reducing the monetary loosening, but has many factors to consider. Although we value the domestic economy and the price, we have to go carefully because of the high uncertainties surrounding the global economy and geopolitical risks, the official stressed. "" Raising the U.S. Federal Reserve rate will not immediately determine the interest rate in our country, but it will determine how it affects our economy, "" he added. The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) has announced a rate hike next month.The central bank's Monetary Policy Committee decided to raise the key interest rate by 0.25 % to 1.50 % from 1.25 % per year. The Monetary Policy Committee issued a minority opinion on the same day, saying, "" Cho Dong-cheol, a member of the Kum-tong committee, should keep interest rates unchanged. "" Lee saw a low impact on the foreign exchange rate due to the rate increase. Although raising the rate would not make the Korean won stronger by expanding the difference between home and abroad, the exchange rate would have much greater impact not only on the domestic and foreign situation but also on the expectations of the local and foreign exchange rates and investors ` attitude toward rate, he said.Lee Joo-yeol, the Bank of Korea Governor, greets the Monetary Policy Committee meeting in November 2017 at the Bank of Korea in Seoul yesterday morning. However, it is necessary to respond to the excessive fluctuations in exchange rates due to the pull phenomenon to stabilize the market, added taehoonlim@newsis.com As for some side effects of the hike in interest rates that lead to increased debt burden for the low-income bracket, it was also pointed out that "" an increase in interest rates may lead to an increase in household debt payment burden, but an increase in the net cost of living for elderly households could lead to an increase in income. ""As for the currency spread route, Lee said, I believe the current rate hikes are rising, and if the rates of general bonds move along, they are generally working smoothly in the past, as shown by the movement of interest rates.As regards the house price outlook, I can`t say that the interest rate policy will not affect real estate prices, but I can not say that various factors have helped determine the price, as the government has set up real estate measures, household debt plans and so on. hacho@newsis.com>"
