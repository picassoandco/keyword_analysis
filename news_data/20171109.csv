The crowds, who were shouting and hooting, lit tar balls and threw them, and firecrackers went off everywhere. When a fireball grows next to the back legs, the young elephant screams in fear. It was taken in West Bengal, India. Viplavhazara's work, ' which was awarded the 2017 Wildlife Photo Contest for Nature and the Protected Areas Foundation, has captured conflicts between the region's old elephants and farmers. The West Bengal, home to 800 Asiacocchiri, is one of the most common conflicts between elephants and poor farmers. Elephants need a large area of 800 square kilometers, but few big forests. Elephants and farmers are increasingly conflicted with each other due to the growing population, road construction, and deforestation. The clashes occur when elephants raided forest farms, went into habitats, or robbed small villages on a journey. Solitary males and females who have young are often at risk. About 400 people die every year in India because of elephants. Another survey found 370 elephants and 1,180 people died from the collision in the Assam region between 1980 and 2003. In India, where about 70 percent of the world's 40,000 to 50,000 elephants live, about 400 people die every year in conflict with elephants and some 500,000 homes live in agriculture. The Indian elephants are endangered species worldwide listed in the International Union for Conservation (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Animals.

Joh Hong-seop, journalist, Hong-seop, could you be my best friend in the Hankyoreh? [Subscription to Man and Animals] [Animal People's] [Final Cakaotalk : If you give up your pain and don't repeat after 15 years of unauthorized punishment, Park Jong-hyeon, you should never fail to get back to school and fail. I thank my wife for not letting me give up my dream. He was always behind the crowd in his departure. When he was a law student at Hanyang University, he could not concentrate on the bar exam. She had a vague experience as an examinee between the state examination and the job, and spent two years wandering after graduating from university in 1996. Because of his close relationship, he spent time hanging out with friends and joined the army late in 1998. After leaving the army at the threshold of 30, he remained jobless. Getting married at the age of 30, she belatedly had a dream of becoming a lawyer. The late but determined dream finally returned to the record set in History. `` The most embarrassing student who passed the bar exam, '' Park Jong-hyun, the oldest person among the nation`s 59 finalists, said after the Justice Ministry confirmed on July 7 that they had passed the final bar exam nationwide. After taking the second examination six times and living in Sillim-dong for 15 years as my hometown, I was impressed. She cried endlessly : "" It was a test that gave her half of her 30s and 40s. The bar exam is my youth. It is an honor and a pleasure to be on the last train. During that time, the juniors went one or two law school. Some were frustrated in front of law school gates. They were either deficient in language scores or were paying for their own language skills. He insisted on a judicial examination. "" This test, which is dedicated to my youth, has brought about a kind of a come-off. "" `` I thought heaven would give me a chance once when I became a hard man. That is why I could not stop the challenge. I thought it might be the wrong choice. Whenever that happened, Kim Hyun-jung (44, head of Hyundai Card's Culture Team) said, "" Don't give up your dream. "" He wanted to work for a publisher, and said, "" You're still young and you don't have to make any money now. Let's get ready to stop two lives. "" When he failed the exam, he held his wife and cried endlessly. Without the devoted care of my wife, I could not pass. Thank you for giving me courage without nagging him. The most difficult time was in the first round of 2014. I lost my father twenty days before the examination. The eldest of two sons and one daughter, Chung, was the father he had hoped to become a lawyer. "" I felt more sad and sorry because you believed me. "" `` Dad, I'm finally a lawyer. '' he said this week when he was going to my father's grave. The second round of bar exams to be canceled this year was announced on July 11. The final round of bar exams in Sillim-dong, Seoul, had 55 people who passed the exam. The desire for reality increased as ' no more bones were seen except this time '. The most important thing to do when you fall down is to wake up again, said ballerina Kang Soo-jin, adding a phrase on a sticky note to her desk. At 6:30 a.m., he left home in Dangsan-dong, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, and studied in a reading room in Sillim-dong. It was the same thing from the first round of entrance exams in February last year to the second in June this year. When he lost confidence, he went to the gym for half an hour a day. `` I ran when I was sick. It was easy when I shed tears and felt sweaty. Park also gave the honor to another woman, Kim Hyun-jung (35), who has the same name as his wife. I passed the bar exam together this time as a member of the study team who is 10 years younger than him. We were very helpful by doing a practice study together, where you set the time, fill out the answers and grade each other. As a late riser who is to be appointed as a ' late-breaking judicial schoolchild ' in March next year, he laughed, "" I'm confident in my life with my younger brothers and sisters because I hung out with my friends at Sillim-dong. "" I want to open the second page of life more nicely than others because it started later. I want to play my part as an axis of how to uphold this society, "" he said. Dreams come true I can not but hear my friend, who was absent last year on the first try, saying, It is so sad to have no hope of a second try. Now, I can`t meet the "" private students "" who were attached to Sillim-dong. It is heartbreaking to see the absence of the judicial examination, which has been a ladder of hope for our colleagues, '' she said. Although I have been hesitant to interview her, I hope others won`t give up on my life dream, seeing me realize my dream after 15 years of challenging myself. I will always support those who suffer from failure in their hearts, he added. The judicial examination, which will be repealed this year, was first held in 63 B.C. and has produced 27,766 lawmakers over the past 54 years. Until the law school opened in 2009, it was the only channel to become a lawyer. People in need were praised for creating the "" dragon of the stream "" and accused of creating the "" gongnagi, "" as they could achieve their dream of success. Beginning next year, only law school graduates will be allowed to take the bar exam. The day the final successful candidates of the final bar exam were announced, the Society for Judicial Testing and Management held a press conference and announced, "" If you are to announce to a generation of law school students, you are going to have to drop your current law school, which serves as a ladder to move the law school. "" The judicial examination, which produced the last 55 successful candidates, including Park, will disappear into history. Lim Sun-young, reporter Youngcan Joongang.co.crk."
"A three-year-old, strong-arrested mother and her father, identified as being arrested on July 12, died while being sentenced to 15 years in jail in an apartment building in Daegu on charges of child abuse and manslaughter. Baek Kyung-seo, "" I will leave Park Hyun-jun (son) in front of the house on May 1st, so know that. Be nice to raise it. "" The case last July, when a three-year-old was left with a leash on his neck and suffocated, was a case concerning his grandmother's death. An elderly woman, Park (48), told The JoongAng Ilbo in an exclusive interview that she was about to drop off her baby in a text message but did not come. After two months, the sky collapsed when I heard that my baby was dead. Park Hyun-jun (3), who died in July of abuse by his biological father and stepmother. Hyun-jun's grandmother demanded a public disclosure of her name and face, saying, "" I want to report to you that her grandson passed away unjustly. "" The first part of the support criminal division of the Daegu District Court (Judge Cho Hyun-cheol) sentenced a stepmom, Park (22), and a father, who were arrested on suspicion of child abuse, to be sentenced to 15 years in jail. Prosecutors have demanded that they be sentenced to 25 years in jail. The defendants were pestering and leash their dogs only because they did not want to see their victims making a mess around the house. The victim suffocated with pressure from the cervical vertebrae without anyone helped her. The crime is very heavy because it invaded life, which is the highest value protected by law. They were also asked to take a 200-hour treatment program for child abuse. In the presence of Park, a grandmother of Hyun Jun (3) was present. Park said, "" The baby is no longer alive, but they are out of the world again after less than 40 years of age. Has the law been a good judge? The incident at Hyunjun County Caneral House dates back to 2013, four years ago. Park's 18-year-old daughter, who was a high school student at the time, had a boyfriend. Then the daughter left home abruptly, saying, I'm not confident to listen to her. A year later, in July 2014, a call was made from her daughter. I heard the child crying over the telephone. Hyun Joon was born on May 29 of that year. Park said, "" I learned that my daughter ran away from home when she was pregnant. When I asked if she had any children, she said, "" I was right and I would like to report my marriage. It is the first time that I knew if Hyun-jun was here. As soon as they reported their marriage, the couple living with their in-laws brought Hyun-jun, who was only two months old, to her grandmother. At first, the two said they were going on a date, leaving the couple to go for a week or 10 days. Park explained that he never took any children with him at any point. Hyun-jun was so pretty that she could really feel the word, "" Honey Love. "" It was just so lovely that I bit my teeth and raised them. I don`t know why he abused me for making a mess with my house when I was really gentle and heard about it well. Park raised Hyun-jun for nine months until her father took her away, saying, "" She is going to marry again. "" Park Hyun-jun (3), who died in July of abuse by his biological father and stepmother. Hyun-jun's grandmother demanded a public disclosure of her name and face, saying, "" I want to report to you that her grandson passed away unjustly. "" In late 2014, her daughter showed her Facebook account and told her husband that she was seeing another woman, so she decided to break up with her. She has not shown her true character since taking her out in early 2015. Park said, I really miss Hyun-jun, but my friend refused to show me the interview and asked to be negotiated for the interview. We were waiting for the results when the team broke up. Meanwhile, Park and Hyun-jun's mother had reportedly told her several times to show Hyun Joon. Then in May of this year, Hyun-jun's biological father suddenly cut off contact with him after saying, "" I'll bring my baby home. "" Whenever she called to say she wanted to see her daughter, she threatened her daughter with marriage. Park said, Considering the evidence of abuse on the part of the child right now, I don`t think I could have brought it with me. A text message shared by Hyun-jun's father and grandmother Park. In May, Hyun-jun's biological father told Park that he would leave the baby in front of the house. In reality, however, her father did not leave her and sent threatening text messages referring to Park's daughter's remarriage. Hyun-jun was finally found suffocated and at the home of his biological father at an apartment in Wolseong-dong, Dalseo-gu, Daegu on July 12. It was eight hours after his death. After unshouldered the leash on Hyun-jun, she told police, "" My child is dead. "" When the 119 rescue team went out, Hyun was lying on her stomach in bed. I had a bruise on me. The jaw also confirmed a torn wound. Traces of bleeding were also found in the child's bed. At the time of his death, Hyun weighed only 10 kilograms. She was about 85 cm shorter than other children her age. During an autopsy by the National Institute of Scientific Investigation, Hyun Jun-yong's death was confirmed as "" cervical compression suffocation "". Police have arrested stepmom and her biological father on suspicion of child abuse. `` If a child was naughty or disturbed at home, I hit him on the back with my hands and also hit him with a plastic broom or dustpan, '' police said. As for why I did not report my dead child to the police soon after I found him, I said, I was scared to see him die. Police concluded that the collar bone connected to the bed made him thirsty. Hyun-jun was believed to have been kept on a leash for three days before dying. At the time, her cousin sister visited her home for three days, but Hyun-jun never saw her in her room, police told her. According to police, the three drank until 3 a.m. the day the baby died. At the time, the police allowed cousin younger sister to go home because she had no further questions. Hyun-jun's maternal grandmother, who died of abuse, is crying in front of her grandson's urn. [The Child Abuse Prevention Association] Park said, I don`t know what a three-year-old would starve to death and beat her. In a dark room for three days, Hyun-jun's heart ruptures when she imagines how scared she must have been alone. I think 15 years in jail is too much. Gong Hye-jung, head of the Korea Child Abusement Prevention Association, also attended the trial, saying, It is unfortunate that the sentences were too small for the size of the sentences, and if I had seen this case, I would have been forced to provide education on how I was being parents and childcare.

"Details of ' security gifts package ' are ... Unprecedented to be sold to other countries and advanced reconnaissance assets that can be developed by the current government. Moon Jae-in, the president of billions of dollars of the United States instead promised to buy military equipment, and U.S. need weapons for the introduction of the South Korean president is Donald Trump.Acceptable. At its core are nuclear powered submarines and state-of-the-art military reconnaissance assets. Regarding Hackjam, a senior presidential official said on September 8, "" There was a general agreement at the New York Summit last September and approval in principle on its introduction has been granted. "" "" You can buy a hacker meat or develop it together (Korea-America), "" he explained. The presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae explained the report, "" It is not true, "" in response to the JoongAng Ilbo report on the "" Agreement on Korea's Hack-Jam, USA, and Korea's Hack-Jam, "" on September 2. The military authorities of the Korean National Security Futures Authority is also considering purchasing Hackjam, but they are encouraged to build their own. This is because the United States has never sold Hack-Jam to other countries. Seo Jook-ryul, an nuclear engineering professor at Seoul National University who is involved in the ministry`s Hack-Jam research project, estimated that the 5,000-ton nuclear reactor would cost around 160 billion won, down from the initial construction cost of the reactor.Moon Jae-in, the government within my term (May by 2022) to launching haekjjam? Korea has enough capacity to launch a hacker operation in three years, Suh said. However, the Act stipulated that "" it would be necessary to concentrate budget and manpower on national projects. "" The military expects that the drying time can be significantly decreased with the proactive U.S. support of technology. Hackjam is not easy to find fuel for. Hackjam uses enriched Uranium-235 as fuel. The concentration is high so it can be used for a long time. However, Korea can not enrich its own uranium, or buy it from the United States, with more than 20 percent of the enriched uranium as a hack-fueled fuel under the Korea-U.S. nuclear agreement. Trump president held as well as to agree on future Korea-U.S. nuclear treaty is in the South Korean Koreans favorable direction is likely to be revised. Cheong Wa Dae does not specify what kind of cutting-edge military reconnaissance assets the two countries agreed upon. But multiple sources said, "" Along with Hack-Jam, E-8 Joint Stars came to the agenda during the September summit and agreed to sell E-8 to Korea. "" E-8 can monitor 600 ground targets 250 kilometers away at the same time by using ground reconnaissance radars. Military authorities have begun the process of introducing the product and have requested specific data and data from U.S. companies, a government source said. E-8 is excellent at distinguishing the type of moving target. If the North introduces the missile, it can help the North keep track of its mobile missile launch pad. If we catch a ground target, we can direct warplanes and other planes to strike, said Kim Hyung-cheol, a former director general of the Korea Post. It is perfect for Kilchein, a system that can carry out preemptive strikes against North Korea`s missiles and artillery when a war is imminent. However, the sale of E-8 must be approved by the U.S. Congress. It is also expensive. As of 1998, the figure is about $ 444.4 million (approximately 273.3 billion won) per unit. It excludes operating costs. An official of the defense industry said, "" The E-8 aircraft (Boeing 707) was discontinued in 1979, and it is not expensive to maintain its old model aircraft, "" adding, "" So the U.S. Air Force is not considering replacing it with an old model. Lee Chul-jae, journalist Seajay Joongang.co.crew. In the past, the prince, who is not usually used to flying helicopters, suffered mysterious helicopter crashes and disappeared. A "" Prince's Day "" that is similar to the blood purge created by Yi Bang-won of King Taejong of the Joseon Dynasty is being held.The change in the principle of succession in Saudi Arabia is what led to the "" Prince's Day, "" which had few noises surrounding the succession since 1932. The Saudi royal succession organization has been replaced by the "" inheritance of sons "". Prince's conflicts erupted when the rule of power transfer changed when the first generation of the first king's sons moved to the next generation of grandchildren.The first Saudi local king, Abdul Aziz, left a will saying before he died in 1953, "" Inherit the throne from brother to brother and not from your son. "" During his founding, he married the daughters of about 20 tribal chiefs and gave birth to 44 princes during his time to unify the Arabian Peninsula's tribes. The first and youngest sons grew to be more than just sons. Abdul Aziz feared that if a prince took the throne and handed it over to his son, his uncle would continue to have a "" Prince's Day "" to take over his nephew's throne. So, the alternative is "" brotherly handover. ""Abdul Aziz dies, and the second king became the eldest son, Saud (throne : 1953 - 1964). The third king was Saud's half brother Faisal (1964-1975), the fourth king was Khalid (1975-1982), the fifth king was Fahad (1982-2005), and the sixth king was Abdullah, currently in his seventh year. The first king succeeded to the throne with his son.However, there was a problem with ' brotherly handover. ' As the throne moved horizontally from one generation to the next, the king grew older. King Saud, the second king, was 51 years old when he took office, when he was 58, fourth-year-old, sixty-year-old, sixty-third, and 81-year-old. There was a Prince's detergent that died first when it waited for him to become king. The Saudi royal family was also nicknamed "" gerontocracy. ""Salman last ended the tradition of brotherly inheritance when he was crowned king in January 2015 at the age of 80. Right after taking office, he had his half-brother Mukrin punished as the Prince's tax collector, but three months later, he was overthrown. Instead, he named his eldest son, Mohamed Vinnayev, Prince One and his biological son, Prince Vinsalman II. The succession of the king has been passed from the first generation of the king's sons to the first generation of grandchildren in 62 years.The structure also rocked the nation. Binzalman mobilized the Royal Guard last June to detain his cousin Vinnayev and take the throne from him : Prince Albert I.Since then, Vinsalman has begun to defend himself, as if he were to strengthen his power. He was the first person to succeed to the throne by rebelling the will of the first king, and he also broke the tradition of succession to the elderly by taking over the throne of his cousin.Having taken control of the military and intelligence services, he turned on the offensive this month. We launched a preemptive strike by mobilizing the Jeong-ye military to arrest potential static princes and their allies on corruption charges.Binzall's control over the existing power was advantageous because he was the wife of the first king's eighth-largest and grandson of the Queen Thalloy. The first king had 22 queens and the queens had several children, so the royal family was divided into political factions by king. The Talkairism produced two kings, those in their 50s and 60s, and in the process, they secured important government positions and became the strongest force.Binzalman is known as a pugnacious ambitious. Since he was young, he has read martial arts books such as ' Sun Sheng Technology. ' He is the most respected figure of Winston Churchill, who led the World War II victory to his charismatic leadership. Britain Independent quoted a German intelligence official as saying, It was Binjalman who decided to intervene in the Saudi war in Yemen. King Salman also hired him as defense minister when he was 30 years old to gain military experience.According to diplomatic sources, he is known to have set up a mentor to the UAE king, Mohamed Bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who spent his entire school days in Saudi Arabia but was known to have promoted a national transformation policy and succeeded. Binzalman's aggressive policies, such as allowing women to drive and setting up a special tourist zone equipped with bikinis, are also cited by the Dubai Abu Dhabi model. On the other hand, he has shown strong opposition to Islamic fundamentalism that runs through the royal generations in their 50s and 60s.He is Donald Trump the president's son-in-law, Jared kusyuneo a special relationship with the international political good sense of character assessment, as well. He consulted with Kushner on the issue before the prince's death to obtain U.S. support.The Wall Street Journal said Monday that it froze the accounts of more than 1,200 princes seized by the Saudi government, adding that it aims to clamp down on corruption charges worth $ 800 billion.[Noseokjo Corrigator.com : Go straight to Dooson.com] - Compritations times & chosun.com, no reproduction or redistribution without permission"

Michelin Korea announced 24 restaurants that received one or three stars at its ' Michelin Guide Seoul 2018 ' at Signiel Hotel in Songpa-gu, Seoul on July 8. This is the second time since last year when it was first announced. Just like last year, 24 restaurants were chosen by the Michelin Guide. Last year, 13 restaurants were based on Korean food or using Korean ingredients. Since last year, Gaon, run by Gwangju High School Group, and Rayeon, who is ranked as the best in Seoul's Shilla Hotel, have gone on a special trip to enjoy their excellent cuisine for two consecutive years. Only 110 restaurants received three stars worldwide. We have been trying to keep a sense of responsibility by thinking about Korean food for the past year, said Kim Byung-jin, a general manager at Gaon. Most noticeable are the new restaurants and restaurants with two stars (a restaurant with excellent cooking and worth visiting in the distance). Jeong recently opened a "" Jungsik "" restaurant in New York and received two stars from the Michelin Guide. We are creating unique dishes inspired by gimbap, bibimbap, gujeolpan and bossam, the panel said. The number of restaurants that received one star (a restaurant with excellent cooking) decreased from last year. Instead, four new restaurants have become famous. Dosa, Exquisin, and Juok are offering dishes based on Hansik.

Yoo Hyun-soo received a star list last year : one star who went out while setting up his own restaurant, and Pierre Ganier, who was closed due to renovations. `` You can't keep up with the stars. We have to renew every year and qualify. As the results are announced each year, the process of maintaining the stars is difficult and stressful, said Kim Seong-il, Rayeon's general chef. In other countries, chefs sometimes kill themselves due to anxiety about maintaining a star rating and being demoted. Michael Ellis, director of the international team for the Michelin Guide, said, As the Michelin Guide was introduced to Seoul, Korean food culture is being reorganized. Seoul is firmly established as the destination for genuine gourmet meals, in any kind of food, '' he said.

The apartments were designated as non-smoking apartments last April, so they can not be smoked on the stairs and parking lots. As I approached the smoking area, the young man slid his cigarette hands behind him. When asked whether he knew he could not smoke in the parking lot, the apartment resident said, I tried to stop smoking only one time before I went out into the house. The non-smoking apartment was introduced in September last year under the Public Health Promotion Act. If more than half of the residents agree, they can apply to local governments and receive applications. Set up a non-smoking area in some or all of the four passages, stairways, elevators, and underground parking lots. There are currently 264 non-smoking apartments nationwide, including 51 in Seoul. A non-smoking sticker is being attached at an apartment complex in Songpa-gu, Seoul, which was designated as a non-smoking apartment in June. [Central Photo] Even though the apartments were designated as non-smoking apartments, there was no reason to control smokers. The bill also imposed 100,000 won in fines for violations of non-smoking areas, but the measures were not applied immediately to accommodate residents. Over the course of a family tree, the fine was adjusted from 100,000 won to 50,000 won, and a revision to the Enforcement Decree was announced on July 7, and went into effect. If I let smokers pay a fine, wouldn't a non-smoking apartment be more comfortable? Residents and management offices at the scene were more suspicious than expected. "" But I will smoke anyone who can. "" One apartment in Dongdaemun-gu has been non-smoking since 2010. It was designated in accordance with the Seoul City ordinance even before the government operated the system. However, people who smoke in non-smoking areas, hallways and on the stairs, are having trouble. There are warning signs on the entrance of apartments, elevators and emergency stairs, but nothing will work. Emergency Steps for Non-smoking Apartments in Dongdaemun-gu As many residents smoke on the non-smoking section, the building has a sign on it with layers of information, but it does not work. The signs appealing for the "" no smoking "" reporter are posted everywhere, regardless of whether they are windows, doors, walls, or rails. A written appeal made and posted at the home of a pregnant woman and a child. It is natural but not to the residents of a non-smoking apartment, but it is not to be kept. On July 7, reporter Baek Soo-jin looked at the emergency stairs to the corridor agreement that the smoking problem was the most serious in the complex. The smoking habit seemed set. Certain floors were filled with sad appeals from neighbors. ' There are pregnant women and babies next door. Cigarette smoke is coming in through the veranda and the laundry smells too. Please smoke outside the apartment. ' On the other floor, a paper cup with cigarette butts was placed just in front of the non-smoking sign. Two signs indicating non-smoking areas were found on the wall and on the stairs, but someone smoked without care. A paper cup with a cigarette butt from a reporter is placed right in front of the smoking information sign. There are also cigarette ash around. No matter how much we broadcast or complain, people continue to smoke, said Baek Soo-jin, a reporter's office. How can we impose a fine on smokers who have only traces left when they don`t go out immediately like a riot squad? A smoker at a non-smoking apartment in Mapo-gu, also immediately confirmed, "" If there were health care workers accompanied, we should have paid a fine. "" Mr. A was unaware that the fine had started the day before. He said, I will be more careful in the future, but I think people who smoke will continue to appear. Emergency stairs with windows are favorite places to smoke among residents. When you open the window and smoke, smoke from the window goes into the veranda of a nearby home. After smoking, it is also a problem to illegally speculate on cigarette butts. In reality, the reality control of reporters with "" Baeksujin "" is based on on-site observations. If you see traces of cigarette butts, you should not track people who smoke there. Gangnam District Health Center said, Sometimes public reports were made based on CCTVs, but there were limitations on identifying and tracking them, and if not identified, they could not impose fines on them. However, due to time and manpower limitations, it is not easy to spot the site. In Gangnam, six workers will take care of all non-smoking areas, including nine non-smoking apartments. Officials in the Seocho district look around the smoking room of a coffee shop. It is virtually impossible for four to six foremen to check the entire non-smoking area, including non-smoking apartments in their jurisdiction, without leaving any gaps. Another problem is that non-smoking areas are excessively restricted. Choi (60), who lives in another non-smoking apartment in Dongdaemun-gu, said, My apartment is only a stair-and-air area, so I smoke out. There are also a lot of smokers in the playgrounds where grandchildren play, and it makes no sense that they can not get fined, said Park, who is also the head of a local smoking club. According to the Health and Welfare Ministry's health promotion department, there has been no discussion on expanding non-smoking areas in non-smoking apartments. It was even very difficult to reach an agreement on four hallways, stairways, elevators and underground parking lots. Since non-smoking apartments are the first step in spreading anti-smoking culture, we need to phase out the culture. Sometimes it would be hard to fine a smoker every time, but could catch someone who would continue to cause inconvenience to residents, he predicted. We are aware of the lack of human resources at the project sites and are planning to draw up a budget to hire one more non-smoking advisor per health center next year, he said.

For businesses with fewer than 10 employees, the monthly benefits of less than 1.9 million won can provide employment insurance and national pension premiums. New subscribers will support up to 90 % of insurance. For businesses that are eligible for financial stabilization assistance and have a new health insurance policy, the insurance premium will be temporarily reduced by 50 percent. If an employee joins the four major insurance policies with an hourly wage of 1-1.2 times or more than the minimum wage, he or she will be entitled to a tax credit for two years for 50 percent of the total social insurance premium paid by the company.

Song Jin-won, a reporter at Seoul Yonhap News Agency, revealed the authenticity of the tablet PC allegedly used by Choi Soon-sil in court on July 9. It is the first time that a real life has been publicly exposed since JTBC first reported the existence of the tablet PC last October. The Seoul Central District Court held a trial run by Choi to verify her tablet PC. The court also disclosed the truth via a physical camera in a court room after it received a tablet PC in a briefcase from the prosecution. The released tablet PC is white made by Samsung Electronics and has the model number ' SHVE 14 S ' on its back and the estimated date ' 20120322GB ' on it. The court allowed Choi, his team of lawyers, and two other experts with Choi's presence to see the tablet PC closely. However, direct contact was prohibited. Choi's experts photographed pictures of the tablets in real colors and recorded them. The prosecutors were concerned, as the photo was done during the trial, that real images should not be leaked to specific groups or media. As we have officially verified it during an open trial, I don`t think it would harm public interest to be recognized outside, said Lee Kyung-jae, lawyer for Choi. We ask that you keep a strict watch on the lawyer since he or she has decided not to go outside, the court said. The court sealed the tablet PC after verification in court. The court will directly send the tablet PC to the National Institute of Scientific Investigation for its own evaluation. "" After a year of desperate efforts, I don't think the actual article was submitted to you as a good idea, "" lawyer Lee Kyung-jae said. "" I don't think Choi ever admitted using such a tablet. "" Choi also said, "" I've been writing for a year, wondering whether some prosecutors were involved in Ko's plans or organized by JTBC. "" "" I first saw this tablet PC today.

"● Conscientious punishment for objectors is unavoidable, "" the National Assembly hearing on Constitutional Court justice nominee Yoo Nam-seok ended, seemingly untrue. Rhyu's opinion of conscientious objectors was one of the issues. One media reported on July 9 that "" Candidate Yoo is our reality that takes into consideration conscription because the two Koreas are facing each other militarily on the issue of criminal punishment for religious objectors, "" and "" criminal punishment is inevitable. "" From this point of view, it looks as if Rhyu is opposed to the alternative service of conscientious objectors.But, in fact, that's not the end of what Rhyu said. At the hearing, he said criminal penalties for conscientious objectors are inevitable, but says the reality of being an ex-convict because of conscience needs to be solved, and that one of the alternatives is alternative. So the reporter delivered the candidate's words as they were, but not the general purpose of his remarks. ● Presidential candidate Yoo Nam-seok had already published a bold paper in 1985 under the Chun Doo-hwan administration that stated, "" We should allow substitution service. "" It was also known before the hearing. In his paper, "" A Study of the Military Law at the Army Headquarters, "" he wrote the essay, "" Legal Review on the Yang-Sim Army's Refusing Military Service. "" He wrote here that the U.S. and West Germany should review the military service laws and precedents, and that in conscience, Korea should actively express its national policies regarding the issue of military service rejection. In addition, the two sides should establish a law to recognize special cases for military service, not dismiss the refusal as a mere threat to national security. Considering the times, it is hard to write without an opinion.1985 was the time when conscientious objectors were punished for military criminal law violation, not for military service law provisions. Conscientious objectors are now not imprisoned but were forced to serve in the military without physical detention, once applied to serve in the home, and then punished under a civil code of honor. The term of sentence was less than two years in jail, but if it was less than two years in jail, he would have deliberately given two orders to appoint a family chief and refused to serve in the military, and would have punished it up to three years in addition. You have to live longer than the military service, so it works. In those days, he published a paper supporting alternative service for conscientious objectors as an active soldier.● The 2004, 2011, and 2018 Constitutional Court decision? The parliamentary hearing on Rhyu was handled without much pain. The head of the Constitutional Court is to go through a parliamentary vote, but since he is not the chief, he is likely to be appointed to the bench with discretion. The Constitutional Court is now stacked with 30 other cases related to the military service law, because before the provisions of the draft law came into force, the provisions were written in the first place.Article 88 of the Military Service Act provides that any person who fails to serve in the military without "" justifiable cause "" will face up to three years in jail. Whether or not the constitutional freedom of conscience is at the heart of the long-standing debate. The court has ruled the clause to be constitutional on two occasions, in 2004 and 2011. There were seven people who were both constitutional and two who were unconstitutional in 2011. In fact, the fact that the unconstitutional Act was "" unconstitutional "" would make a person who did not ignore a violation of the law, and therefore would not have to pay the right to avoid military service if the courts ruled it was unconstitutional.Even after the 2011 decision to be constitutional, some defendants asked for a repeat of Article 88.1 of the Military Service Law, which is to be recommended by unconstitutional judges, and 30 such cases were accumulated. It is the oldest instance that the court has made an inconclusive decision. The Military Service Law stands, in the National Assembly`s administrative inspections and the Constitution, the last time bakancheol said in his term in office to decide in a case, gukjjeong nongdan The situation is.President and all psychological, in the impeachment trial was suspended. Now that Yoo Nam-seok is considered to be a nine-person perfect body again when appointed to the Constitutional Court, he is expected to try the military service law case quickly.● Nine member system, judging by the tendency of Constitutional Court judges … I have considered what the eight constitutional justices said about the alternative service system to conscientious objectors when they saw the confirmation hearing held in the National Assembly. According to a report received from the Constitutional Court during the last parliamentary inspection, the three justices who positively answered the alternative civil service system were Cho Chang-soo (Kim Yi-soo, Kang Il-won and Lee Seon-ae), two negative judges. If candidate Yoo Nam-seok is appointed, the affirmative will be four, but not enough of the six required to decide whether or not to uphold the constitution. For now, depending on what the three people who have left their stance on the table are making, all unconstitutional is possible. The difference from 2004 and 2011 is in the courts.● 35 cases of first instance in 2017 … `` The unprecedented confusion of judges over a single law clause in judicial history '' and such confusion resulted in an unprecedented denial of service in the court's ruling. No wonder, the number of convictions against conscientious objectors has risen sharply this year. The first time the verdict was in 2004, three years later, there was one acquittal. And after a while the conviction was continued, the sentence of innocence began again in 2015. In 6 cases in 2015, 7 cases in 2016 and 35 cases of acquittal were found nationwide in the first trial alone until September of this year.Last October, he was acquitted in the second trial. For the defendant, this is a case where he may find the verdict "" unsatisfactory. "" Depending on where the cases are distributed to the judge, the first trial could lead to guilt or innocence. Of course, if the first trial fails, the prosecution appeals, and if the second trial is found guilty, the defendant appeals to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court case has not yet changed.● The lowest number ever, 600 or so people in jail … what is their fate? According to lawyer Baek Jong-geon, the Supreme Court has 110 conscientious objectors waiting for a final ruling. The three were found innocent by the prosecution and the rest by the defendant. Some cases were prosecuted in 2011 and are still pending, lawyer Baek said. Conscientious objectors are usually sentenced to one and a half years in jail, and parole means they can be released in one and two months, which means they have lived five jail terms in six years. When combined with cases scheduled in the first and second trial, the number of people awaiting judgment reached 600.If the court decides again next year on the military service law, the court's ruling will be swift, and the number of people who give up an appeal or an appeal may increase. It is because it is better for objectors to face prison time than to question the trial. Then nearly a thousand could be imprisoned in a short time, adding to the 600 who are awaiting trial and the number of people who have normally been imprisoned each year. As the trial is delayed, the number of people who are now imprisoned for conscientious objectors is at an all-time low.● "" Hey, you got ta have someone who's called "" Possession "" in an alternative prison that's actually already in effect in effect. People in prisons who have to have a stomach, clean, and do all the odd jobs that the officials in charge can't pick up. "" "" Oi! The people who carry possession, although there is no regulation, are routinely conscientious objectors. It seems like he trusts and writes government employees. She gets thrown in jail, in jail, and leaves after finishing her non-gun duties. You become an ex-convict and are exempt from military service. But what it does now is it's actually substitute work. They're part of the operations of public facilities, prisons, prisons.The National Assembly has also submitted a revised bill that would define alternative service. It would make you serve in the army for three years, which is 1.5 times more than two years. However, it is not easy for the law to pass the National Assembly. Moon Jae-in substitution service system, the government to introduce alternative service is president pledges to the relevant legislation may submit to the National Assembly. Whatever comes first, the Constitutional Court, which has become the nine-person system, may make a decision whether it is constitutional or unconstitutional. If unconstitutional, the ongoing events are likely to be acquitted, and those punished after the last constitutional decision was made can be found not guilty through a review.● Weed selection, risk of accidents, fear of beating … I've already weighed the inclination of constitutional judges, but what is more important than that is the service condition of our military. As the court ruled that the clauses were constitutional in 2004 and 2011, it stated in its ruling concerning pending issues that should be addressed before the implementation of the substitute service. Freedom of conscience is important, and it makes sense not to have ex-convicts produced, and frankly, if it is difficult to give conscientious objectors a fixed sentence of one year and six months, it is important to know when to get rid of it.The court said in its ruling of August 26, 2004, that the phrase "" an improvement in the military service condition should not have been met "" as a precondition for the adoption of a substitute military service, and that it is not the only requirement that should have been addressed in its 2004. And I said, "" You know, the conditions of service are very good."
"The more dangerous and inferior it is, the stronger the sanctions are needed against anyone who avoids the obligation, "" so it is not inevitable that objectors would face jail time for being forced to face jail time. Constitutional Court judges in 2018 will review whether the prerequisite has been settled, while discussing the military service law.Until I pretend that I have an I.Q. of 53 ... what is the alternative service, where should I spend the next few years?Recently, a 30-something man who had posed mentally ill for two years to stay out of the military was arrested for violating military service laws. Originally, I was diagnosed with first degree physical examination, so I pretended to have schizophrenia, cheated a doctor at the mental hospital, and was exempted with a fake medical certificate. I later took an I.Q. test to get my driver's license. The court was concerned. In 2011, the decision says, "" You have to live with the same dangers as a gun accident or an explosive accident. "" So it was inevitable that you would acquire foreign citizenship or you would have to avoid the burden.▶ If a mental patient is cheated by the military or a doctor … but the doctor implements a medicine substitute service, it depends on the conditions of service and the length of service in particular, whether or not it can settle down properly. If I say 1.5 times the active duty period as amended by the National Assembly now, I wonder if I can prevent any movement to avoid active duty. If the substitute service is extended to a certain extent, it would be better to consider the active duty and keep an eye on the public. At first, it would take a period of time to think, "" I'd rather be on active duty, "" to minimize conflicts in implementing the substitute work system. Although few foreigners avoided their military service without setting the substitute period too long, it seems difficult to apply it as our military service conditions are very different.

More than 10 people have decided to run for mayor of Cheongju and have changed their standards or are mentioned as candidates for Jacheon Thacheon. As many former mayors, provincial council chairmen, and municipal council chairmen cast ballots, the votes for those who went against them became complicated. Five candidates formed a group in the ruling, the U.S. Marine Workers Party. It signals a strong primary race in the party. The strongest candidate for the Democratic Party is former Mayor Han Beom-duk. There is no doubt that he is a representative runner of the ruling party. In the 2014 local elections, Lee and Lee fought neck and neck until the last minute, but they were defeated by a narrow margin. In the Democratic Party, Yeon Chul-heum and Lee Kwang-hee, the committee's secretary, also decided to run. Yeo, who is considered a close associate of ambassador Roh Young-min, is stepping up her efforts to raise awareness by emphasizing her experience as chairman of the Cheongju City Council in the first half of the Min-Sun era. Lee is pushing for a shift in generations under the slogan of innovation in Cheongju. He is working hard to create a "" living pledge "" that will make voters feel good about themselves, including a survey of the image of Cheongju city last month of his acquaintances. Former vice mayor of Cheongju, Jeong Jeong-soon, former governor of the North Chungcheong Province, joined the main opposition Democratic Party in September and joined the GNP primary race. We will make Cheongju a competitive city, he said in a news conference on July 25. Former North Chungcheong Province Chairman Kim Hyung-keun, the floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, is also a candidate for the Democratic Party.Many of the contenders are also preparing to run in the GNP, which is affiliated with Lee. Congressman Hwang Young-ho, a four-term council member, and Kim Byung-kook, former first chairman of the unified Cheongju City Council, are determined to run. Hwang was scheduled to visit the sister city of Qing in China from July 13 to 17, but cancelled the schedule when Lee resigned from the post. The intention is to strengthen cooperation on the city council level so as not to cause any disruptions to the city government, but it is analyzed that it can be understood that it will support the next mayor's election. Former Chairman Kim is known to be speeding up his move to win the party nomination. Having served as the former chairman of the National Assembly in Chung-ju City, he boasts of being the mayor of Cheongju, with the advantage of being able to build both Cheongju and Cheongwon. Kim Yang-hee, chairman of the National Assembly of North Chungcheong Province, is also showing her willingness to run, hoping to win a nomination as a female candidate. Chairman Kim was elected as co-chairman of the national women's council of the Korea Party on July 8, raising awareness among the GNP. It is also known that Park Kyung-gook, former vice minister of safety and administration, who was named as head of the ruling Saenuri Party's South Korean election committee in last year's general elections. The National Party is expected to run for the President-General of North Chungcheong Province and Lim Heon-kyung of Sohn Hak-gye, who exchanged talks with Rep. Shin Eon-kwan before the presidential election. The two contenders, who have been engaged in an underground search, are expected to step down from their posts and start to see off. Some predict that the election will heat up at an early stage as political parties will fiercely compete to decide who will run for the presidency next February or March. ks@yna.co.kr driver door (Make sure you tell the story headline.) or report is here (Click!) the latest fashion trend area, all American president (Click!), Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.Expansion the summit's opening statement, the two countries. © 1 news : afp ""not normal. … U.S.-China trade more fairly.""

Trump president is “There's nothing to skip South Korea will be” the theory ‘passing,’ to be dismissed at a press conference after the summit of the National Assembly on October 8.“Korea is aware that a reliable ally.” he said in a speech emphasized over and over again. Regarding this, bagwongon handongdae the professor said, “Trump is president, citing Korean history up until the Korean people's emotional part of the speech touching.” National University of Foreign Affairs professor Shin Beom-cheol also said, We have received a security pledge from the United States. Diplomatic and security experts reaffirmed a strong alliance with the United States that Moon Jae-in at the Trump visit to Seoul government agreed that the maximum performance. The agreement to completely eliminate the weight limit of Korean missiles and start consultations to acquire and develop the U.S.'s state-of-the-art military assets is not necessarily disadvantageous to us, according to experts. `` Some high-tech weapons were not sold by the U.S. governments because they hurt the regional strategic balance, '' said Professor Park Won-gon of the Center for Advanced Policy Studies, who said, `` It is possible that they will be jointly developed.

However, many point out that it is regrettable that the North Korean nuclear threat has not been materialized in defending the alliance immediately, although it has maximized. Professor Park Won-gon said, It is the limit that we failed to draw out a constant deployment of U.S. strategic assets to secure deterrence against North Korea. Some worry that if North Korea declares an end to provocations and a freeze on its nuclear program, the two countries could cause a rift in cooperation. Rather than making a larger interpretation of the current news on the possibility of dialogue in the United States, it is desirable to follow the consensus spirit of sanctions and pressures for the time being.

Police in Suseo, Seoul announced yesterday that they arrested a wife and her husband (40) and her husband, Seo (38), on charges of kidnapping a minor to pay him money and kidnapping them overseas. They falsely told Baek's youngest daughter that they would invite her to their home for a family trip and ask for 150 million won from her parents. When they bought shares from K-level's parents and recommended to invest in the stock market, they lost money due to the decline in stock prices, they committed the crime to recover their investment. Seo, a brother-in-law, took K's children with him and left for Indonesia on July 24, and his wife immediately asked for 450 million won (460,000,000 U.S. dollars) in loans, threatening the parents of the boy band. Her husband, Paik, then instructs his brother-in-law to take away the K-levels from his parents and cut off contact with them, then contact them after a deposit is made in Indonesia on July 1.

"Seo Mi-sook, a reporter with a high deposit preference (Yonhap news agency), said, "" The high-rention apartment rental price is skyrocketing in the Seoul metropolitan apartment market. As the loan amount decreased due to stricter regulations on loans in speculative areas such as Seoul following the real estate policy, buyers prefer high-priced apartments to reduce the initial financial burden. Apartments that rent more than rent have become more popular in the real estate market. The prolonged low interest rates led to annual rent of 4 to 5 percent, rather than the actual interest rate being held at less than 1 percent a year, in a re-teaching way. Unless someone was to move in immediately, many investment needs preferred ' leverage ' re-teaching, with monthly rates covered in profit, rather than getting maximum bank loans with free money. In the same vein, the rent of apartments in Seoul exceeded 30 percent of the rent in the first half of this year. However, the situation has drastically changed since August 2. As it is difficult to make a loan, the owners of brokerage firms explain that they will have to pay deposit first if they find it difficult to make regular investment or move in and out of the market immediately. As a measure to cool down 8-2 real estate prices, mortgage loan ratios (LTV) and mortgage loan repayment rates (DTI) in overheated speculation areas such as Seoul were tightened to 40 % in those areas. If there is more than one mortgage loan, the rate has dropped to 30 percent within speculative overheated areas. Because of this, buyers first look for high-paid apartments to reduce initial investment burden. The wholesale market price of a new apartment complex in Seoul is currently between 950-467 million won, in the case of a new town with a unit of 89 ㎡, according to Yonhap news. Even if LTV is applied up to 40 % due to the lack of existing loans, the maximum amount of lending is approximately 380 million won. However, the rental fee for this type of house is approximately 470 million won, and can be reduced by up to 100 million won when it comes to high-paying homes. Due to the tight loan, high-paid apartments are sold before full-rention homes these days, said a representative of a Mok-dong brokerage house, which is probably behind on high-rents and low-paid sales. It is similar in the Gangbuk districts of Mapo-gu and Yongsan-gu. Most of the potential buyers who will be moving in after a year are even more expensive to purchase apartments, even though they do not have to choose high-provided apartments to buy and maximize the number of homes they buy. A brokerage house owner in Ahhyeon-dong, Mapo-gu, said, "" The purchase price of apartments on the nearby exclusive 80-square ㎡ could not be increased by 800 to 820 million won or more, but the guarantee costs are currently 250 to 350 million won. "" An official at a local brokerage house in Seoul`s Hannam district said, Amid growing investment demands in redevelopment projects such as Hannam New Town, housing rents are largely under-purchased and thus unable to make purchases, a guarantee against the low rate is needed. We once had many buyers wanting to buy homes and rent their homes, but we felt a sense of separation, said a representative at a brokerage house in Daechi-dong, southern Seoul, who wanted to tighten loan regulations.

"" The Trump administration may have fundamentally mistaken views on China's influence in North Korea, especially on young, unpredictable leader Kim Jong-un.Trump thinks North Korea too simply, said former vice foreign minister for the six-party talks between the two Koreas. It is as if China could solve the nuclear problem by cutting off its oil supply to North Korea, the official said.`` If Trump can make a slightly more innocent calculation, '' said Matthew P. Goodman, a political and economic analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). `` If he is more lenient with China regarding trade. However, I doubt whether China feels the same way.Citing some Chinese experts, NYT said China supplied most of its energy and fought with North Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War, but has not been able to view the two countries as friends since.Some Chinese then described the relationship between the two countries as a "" fake alliance, "" while the two counties currently have no business relationship and the North Korean and Chinese leadership's bridge, Chang Jang-tak, was cleared as a member of the ruling camp.In particular, China`s influence on the North may have worsened last month as the Chinese head of state decided to improve ties with South Korea, it added.© 1 U.S. officials, Trump Trump the president is the 11-day official visit to Asia started designer Bang Eun Young news to solve the North Korea gave concessions on trade in China.Denied reports say.But Trump, the president a conciliatory in China to visit unexpected trade continue the statement. Instead of pressuring China to open its market, he appears to focus on closing the big deal for his own company.In addition, the U.S., as president, and a ball, and unusually for making friends with praising a leader of the Chinese Communist Party.However, questions are raised as to whether Beijing, which has been cooperating with a series of U.N. resolutions and has gradually tightened sanctions against North Korea.Some experts say China's oil embargo would damage North Korea's stability and make it difficult for refugees to flock to the border area.I don`t think China will participate in the North Korean regime. Aborting the energy supply to the North significantly increases the risk. Xi said, How can we do this when we stressed China`s reninic identity during the 19th party convention last month? Moreover, we have to work with the United States, a major competitor to China, to help China import oil exports.Icep @8"

Prosecutors yesterday arrested National Intelligence Service Director Kim Heon-jung, Vice Justice Minister Lee Geum-ro, Board of Audit and Inspection Chairman Byun Chan-hyeon, Legislation and Judiciary Committee chief Kim Woo-sook, and National Intelligence Service official Kim Woo-suk on charges of suicide. The Justice Ministry said it had something to regret when lawmakers pointed out that corruption cases were possible during the probe. Lawmakers from the ruling and opposition parties agreed that the command of the investigation led by Seoul District Public Prosecutors ' Office Chief Yun Seok-yeol could be problematic.Speaking at the Legislation and Judiciary Committee meeting that morning, Vice Justice Minister Lee Geum-ro said, I didn`t have any human rights violations during the investigation, but I regret personally that I have not been involved in any excessive investigations.When the prosecution pointed out that Byeon's children and family were in front of it, I will respect the prosecutor Yoon-ji`s claim by saying, We will respect the request.Still, the related investigation should proceed thoroughly, Lee added, I think some criticism is necessary for the case to be settled quickly.Members of the Free Korea Party, a judiciary committee, argued on the same day that Byeon's jump was due to Yoon`s revenge, and that prosecutors should not have the authority to supervise the NIS comments."" Now the investigation team is investigating the former NIS comment cases, including the prosecutor's office, "" said Rep. Yeo Sang-kyu of the Free Korea Party. "" If the prosecutors point out that they have acted as a disturbance, they will provoke a personal revenge. "" There are real miscalculations in cleaning up the evil, but there are many cases of political retaliation, said Rep. Yoo, claiming that prosecutors have been used in revenge against the political system.The head of the judiciary committee, Gwonseon-dong, the same party, also said, YoongjI is not allowed to investigate the scandal because she was involved in the NIS comment. Kwon said, We did not violate human rights during the investigation, and it is a classic violation of human rights that all of his blood was revealed before summoning an independent counsel.The ruling party also pointed out that it has problems. The ruling party also pointed out that it has problems. It is not appropriate for prosecutors who have been disturbed by the interference in the investigation of the NIS comment, said Chun Tae-seop, director of the fishermen ` party, to seriously consider reassessing the case. Although it is believed that the investigation team including prosecutor Yun Ji-jang was impartial, outside of it is thought that the Seoul Central District Public Prosecutors ` Office is the party, the Justice Ministry or the Supreme Public Prosecutors ` Office should supervise the probe.Rep. Cho Eung-cheon of the same party also pointed out, We should appoint a special prosecutor or investigate him objectively. Prosecutors seem to be saying whether the investigation team was in charge of investigating comments then (the investigation team) and if some parties were prevented from investigating comments, they should be able to ensure fairness in the investigation.Members of the ruling party stressed, however, that the investigation itself should continue to reveal the truth. Rep. Lee Chun-seok said, We must disclose truth even if we do not want such a tragedy to occur again. Finding the power behind the attack is the essence of the investigation, he argued.Meanwhile, the ministry and the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court, the Board of Audit and Inspection and the Ministry of Government Legislation were also proposed for next year's budget. The government has agreed to consider increasing the number of youth recovery centers, which point out to the lack of funds provided by foster agencies to prevent repeat offenders.Rep. Roh Hoe-chan of the ruling Democratic Party said, The budget for the 2017 budget was set at 750 million won to support the Youth Recovery Center, but the actual amount of money spent was estimated at 7.85 billion won per year.The Supreme Court requested 1.3 billion won but it was not reflected by the government (the budget planning process), said Kim So-young, chief of the court's administrative office.

The Korea Cultural Properties Research Institute, commissioned by the Korea Foundation on May 9, found a female burial site at a former Gwangju prison for four days. In May 18, the first section of the 3rd Airborne Brigade's 16th Battalion was completed outside the prison's northern (Damyang) fence and along the 177-meter-wide stretch of rock burial ground. Four days of investigation showed no evidence of cancer sales. The foundation and the Korea Cultural Properties Research Institute are scheduled to meet at 4 p.m. on the same day to discuss ways and scope of future excavation research. The foundation originally planned to divide the 40 meters of the upper section of the first section of the work (from Western Gwangju to Damyang Expressway) by 10 meters, but it decided to seek out step 2 and decide on a schedule later. If so, it is expected that the work will be carried out faster due to the eight pipes found at 1m underground. Researchers say excavation work is unlikely to yield any remains due to the fact that it is at least once. In the second stage, an excavator will be used to dig the ground to get the pipes installed. The method of excavation for cultural assets is being switched from the bottom of the pipe. A hoe and spade will be used to scrape out the soil at the most significant points of the hole, compare the color of the soil fault and check for evidence of another excavation. If you dig it out once and bury it again, it will turn into a black line, so you can see it with your eyes. If no other excavation marks are found after the dig is made by more than 1.5 m, the third stage of excavation for the last 37m section is underway.· Newsis and Ryoo Hyung-keun : On the afternoon of July 9, the May 18 Memorial Foundation and the Korea Cultural Properties Research Institute were found to have recovered from their bodies near the North Wall of Gwangju Prison in northern Gwangju, and were presumed to have been buried by the South Korean Army in May 1980.

"Italian scientists have replaced 80 percent of their skin cells with the stem cells that were fertilized by the mutation gene. Stem cells are primitive cells that grow into the body's various cells. Scientists hope that replacing diseased and damaged cells with stem cells will help treat the disease fundamentally. The study is a perfect testament to the healing power of stem cells like this.Researchers at the University of Modena in Italy have successfully replaced the damaged skin cells of a seven-year-old boy with rare genetic disorders, in a study published in the International Journal of Scientific Research (Nature) on July 9.The boy suffered from a rare skin disease called epidermolysis, which led to a cleft lip. Because protein, which forms the basis of the epidermal tissue, is not produced due to gene mutation, the disease blisters on minor stimuli and peels off the skin. External stimuli or skin damage that prevents pathogens can cause severe pain and eventually lead to skin cancer. So far, there are no suitable remedies available.The scientists first inserted a normal gene to replace the mutant gene in the detonized virus. Then he took the cells from the boy's skin that was still intact. When the virus was inserted into the skin cell, the mutation gene was turned into a normal gene. The scientists then cultured the cells and transplanted them into the patient's skin. After 21 months, the patient fully recovered. Eighty percent of the skin of the patient has been changed to normal. Skin regeneration was also carried out normally.Professor Michele de Luca said, "" The results have shown that a few stem cells can replace a damaged skin. "" The original skin was incubated with stem cells that had not yet grown into other cells and those that had already been differentiated. After eight months, however, all of the skin of the patients was changed to skin cells from stem cells. The researchers said no side effects such as an immune rejection after surgery were reported.Professor Maria Seleste Aragona of the Free University of Brussels in a report in Nature said, "" With stem cells that have been fertilized of genes, we can safely and effectively assess the performance of replacing hard-to-cure skin. "" There have been many attempts to replace diseased cells with stem cells, but most of them have never been replaced. Aragona said, "" As many viruses delivered with normal genes are likely to cause other diseases, we needed the latest gene correction techniques to be applied in the future, such as crisper gene scissors.

The Seoul Central District 9, an official at the National Intelligence Service probe team ""Kim a warrant against an official of Cheong Wa Dae, Lee Myung-bak, the president proposed no."" and told reporters.""At the moment, yes."" he said. Prosecutors requested an arrest warrant for Kim Thursday on charges of engaging in politics. While serving as defense minister from 2010 to 2014, Kim is involved in cyber politics by ordering former military cyber commander Yeon Je-wook to support the government, the ruling camp and the opposition. In particular, these comments and the Duke is Kim Lee Myung-bak at the time of reporting suspected of the activities for president. Prosecutors, however, Kim Lee Myung-bak, former president of the minister's arrest warrant will be related was did not detail. Matters concerning the Presidential Secretary for Foreign Strategy and Defense at that time were excluded from the charges, and there was no suspicion that former Minister Kim reported his comment to Cheong Wa Dae or other presidential secretaries. Former Defense Ministry Policy Director Lim Kwan-bin, who was sentenced to arrest along with former cyber commander Oh Do-kyung and former minister Kim, was cited as an accomplice in political involvement. The former minister Kim is over for an investigation after Lee Myung-bak at the time, Cheong Wa Dae will decide whether to widen their investigation into government.

The answer to this question is whether it is appropriate for Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office, which was the main opposition to the National Intelligence Service's interference with the investigation in 2013, to take charge of the probe. We believe the victim is not an individual but a national and the nation is probably the victim in connection with the obstruction of justice, said an official of the NIS investigation team. "" If the truth was not covered up or covered up at the time, and had it been found to have been true at the time, wouldn't the responsible person be responsible?

"" The prosecution is also set to recall former NIS chief Nam Jae-jun to investigate the NIS obstruction of justice. Prosecutors summoned Nam for questioning the day before, but they have only investigated him for paying for special NIS activities.

Local governments across the nation are expanding parks with taxpayers ` money and hosting various events to encourage citizens to participate. However, some citizens who are preoccupied with individual pleasures have their eyebrows lifted or their safety threatened, as they step on flowers or destroy the equipment. People who visited a multI-million farm in front of the Government Complex in Gwacheon, Gyeonggi Province, were fascinated with the autumn atmosphere on July 5. Citizens were enjoying the atmosphere of the late autumn, taking pictures with the background of a huge field of sand. But here and there, the grass was scattered on the floor, trampled by people's feet. It was noticeable that the photo would make a good impression on the floor with a wad of views.Some senseless citizens taking pictures by invading flower beds in the park have damaged flowers. Kim Yoo-jin, a journalist at the Korea Media Center, said, "" It was not just a huge event. Some of the children on the picnic with mats spread out on the lawn shook the bush's stem, but none of them would stop it. Cho In-young (35), a housewife, said, "" If I came out for a long walk and had fun with the autumn scene, I would have to sit down and take a good look at some innocent people. "" "" I wouldn't mind the silver grass and trees. The flower bed in Pyeongchon Central Park in Anyang City, Gyeonggi Province was also devastated with its black soil exposed. The broken flower branches had withered on the floor. A housewife, Lim (51), who is out for a walk in the morning and evening said, "" I knew I was crawling in front of a flower bed, and when I took a picture, I felt embarrassed and had to take pictures of my children. "" She also ate mice because of my parents and couples. A 37-year-old worker said, We don`t keep to the sign 100 times to avoid the flower bed. If you step through a flower and take a picture every minute or two, you can not watch and watch it all day, "" he said. In front of the Government Complex in Gwacheon, some hundreds of thousands of acres are also cluttered with fallen silver grass that the citizens stepped on. Won Ho-yeon, a reporter at the park, also found that some citizens ' selfishness in Korea were suffering because they did not value all of their assets. The exercise equipment installed at a park in Goyang City, Gyeonggi Province was equipped with five or six people working out, but no one was using a pair of legs on a support table and no one was using a flying thighs trainer. "" It's a good exercise outfit for a while, but I feel bad and I feel bad about it, "" says housewife Namo (56). "" I once saw people running around thinking it was a toy. "" Han (23), who goes out every weekend with his family to play badminton, said, I don`t know when I see people drinking here when it is most unpleasant, "" adding, `` If I don't know why I'm so angry, I should roll over my bag of cookies and cans.

As a result of China's regulation, it has jumped only two months after it gave up the $ 3,000 range.According to Coin Desk, a virtual currency information provider in Britain on July 8 (local time), the Bitcone Price Index (BPI) was quoted at $ 7879.06 that afternoon. Since then, it has dropped to $ 7078.96 and is trading at around $ 7400. Bitcone's price has increased more than six-fold this year compared to a month ago. The trend of the Bitcone Price Index is explained as the result of developers ' cancellation of the launch of the new BitT wit coin currency. Seg-Wit 2x, led by the mining companies in China, was scheduled to be launched in the middle of this month, following Bitcond Cache and Bitcone Gold. "" Bitcone set a new record after developers announced that they would suspend their virtual call split plans, "" the CNBC said, "" and has been frozen by investors over the past few months to upgrade (split plans). """" The upgrade was unfortunately not reached a consensus until we were unfortunately able to agree on it, "" Mike Bell, co-founder of BitGo and co-founder, said in an e-mail today.Bloomberg notes that it will reach the $ 8000 range soon, noting that the beatcoiner market is continuing to rise alone, compared to other virtual currencies such as the dollar. Among virtual currency, Vickons are becoming the key currency. The previous day, the Financial Times introduced Bitcone despite Chinese regulations, saying, "" Trade is brisk. "" The world`s biggest derivatives exchange announced it would introduce the Bitcond Futures Agreement before the end of this year. "" There is certainly a bubble, "" he stressed, even though "" as long as we design world class gifts and make rules, there will be no bubble market. "" CME announced late last month that it plans to start trading in Bitcone futures in the fourth quarter of this year. This means that Bitcone has become recognized as an investment commodity, such as gold and oil. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) evaluated, "" It is a significant move to reduce the risk factor of the rapid price volatility of Bitcone. "" Virtual currencies, including Bit-coins, were expected to replace "" next generation currency "" as they had no transaction space and time limits and were cheaper than existing banks and did not need to exchange money.On the other hand, there is still a concerned look at the bit coin. New York University professor Dr. Doom Nouriel RoubinI, who is famous for being a pessimist, called the next big speculation bubble "" a big bubble. "" "" There is no reason to be at the base of the current price level, "" he said, adding, "" Bitcone is feeding himself.

"The farmers took their habitat, the elephants trampled on crops, the 400 dead in India alone, and the burning tar balls in front of their endangered forepaws left their ears irritated them, and the mother's nose was tense. The crowds, who were shouting and hooting, lit tar balls and threw them, and firecrackers went off everywhere. When a fireball grows next to the back legs, the young elephant screams in fear. It was taken in West Bengal, India. Viplavhazara's work, ' which was awarded the 2017 Wildlife Photo Contest for Nature and the Protected Areas Foundation, has captured conflicts between the region's old elephants and farmers. The West Bengal, home to 800 Asiacocchiri, is one of the most common conflicts between elephants and poor farmers. Elephants need a large area of 800 square kilometers, but few big forests. Elephants and farmers are increasingly conflicted with each other due to the growing population, road construction, and deforestation. The clashes occur when elephants raided forest farms, went into habitats, or robbed small villages on a journey. Solitary males and females who have young are often at risk. About 400 people die every year in India because of elephants. Another survey found 370 elephants and 1,180 people died from the collision in the Assam region between 1980 and 2003. In India, where about 70 percent of the world's 40,000 to 50,000 elephants live, about 400 people die every year in conflict with elephants and some 500,000 homes live in agriculture. The Indian elephants are endangered species worldwide listed in the International Union for Conservation (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Animals.

[Subscription to Man and Animals] [Animal People's] [Final Cakaotalk : If you give up your pain and don't repeat after 15 years of unauthorized punishment, Park Jong-hyeon, you should never fail to get back to school and fail. I thank my wife for not letting me give up my dream. He was always behind the crowd in his departure. When he was a law student at Hanyang University, he could not concentrate on the bar exam. She had a vague experience as an examinee between the state examination and the job, and spent two years wandering after graduating from university in 1996. Because of his close relationship, he spent time hanging out with friends and joined the army late in 1998. After leaving the army at the threshold of 30, he remained jobless. Getting married at the age of 30, she belatedly had a dream of becoming a lawyer. The late but determined dream finally returned to the record set in History. `` The most embarrassing student who passed the bar exam, '' Park Jong-hyun, the oldest person among the nation`s 59 finalists, said after the Justice Ministry confirmed on July 7 that they had passed the final bar exam nationwide. After taking the second examination six times and living in Sillim-dong for 15 years as my hometown, I was impressed. She cried endlessly : "" It was a test that gave her half of her 30s and 40s. The bar exam is my youth. It is an honor and a pleasure to be on the last train. During that time, the juniors went one or two law school. Some were frustrated in front of law school gates. They were either deficient in language scores or were paying for their own language skills. He insisted on a judicial examination. "" This test, which is dedicated to my youth, has brought about a kind of a come-off. "" `` I thought heaven would give me a chance once when I became a hard man. That is why I could not stop the challenge. I thought it might be the wrong choice. Whenever that happened, Kim Hyun-jung (44, head of Hyundai Card's Culture Team) said, "" Don't give up your dream. "" He wanted to work for a publisher, and said, "" You're still young and you don't have to make any money now. Let's get ready to stop two lives. "" When he failed the exam, he held his wife and cried endlessly. Without the devoted care of my wife, I could not pass. Thank you for giving me courage without nagging him. The most difficult time was in the first round of 2014. I lost my father twenty days before the examination. The eldest of two sons and one daughter, Chung, was the father he had hoped to become a lawyer. "" I felt more sad and sorry because you believed me. "" `` Dad, I'm finally a lawyer. '' he said this week when he was going to my father's grave. The second round of bar exams to be canceled this year was announced on July 11. The final round of bar exams in Sillim-dong, Seoul, had 55 people who passed the exam. The desire for reality increased as ' no more bones were seen except this time '. The most important thing to do when you fall down is to wake up again, said ballerina Kang Soo-jin, adding a phrase on a sticky note to her desk. At 6:30 a.m., he left home in Dangsan-dong, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, and studied in a reading room in Sillim-dong. It was the same thing from the first round of entrance exams in February last year to the second in June this year. When he lost confidence, he went to the gym for half an hour a day. `` I ran when I was sick. It was easy when I shed tears and felt sweaty. Park also gave the honor to another woman, Kim Hyun-jung (35), who has the same name as his wife. I passed the bar exam together this time as a member of the study team who is 10 years younger than him. We were very helpful by doing a practice study together, where you set the time, fill out the answers and grade each other. As a late riser who is to be appointed as a ' late-breaking judicial schoolchild ' in March next year, he laughed, "" I'm confident in my life with my younger brothers and sisters because I hung out with my friends at Sillim-dong. "" I want to open the second page of life more nicely than others because it started later. I want to play my part as an axis of how to uphold this society, "" he said. Dreams come true I can not but hear my friend, who was absent last year on the first try, saying, It is so sad to have no hope of a second try. Now, I can`t meet the "" private students "" who were attached to Sillim-dong. It is heartbreaking to see the absence of the judicial examination, which has been a ladder of hope for our colleagues, '' she said. Although I have been hesitant to interview her, I hope others won`t give up on my life dream, seeing me realize my dream after 15 years of challenging myself. I will always support those who suffer from failure in their hearts, he added. The judicial examination, which will be repealed this year, was first held in 63 B.C. and has produced 27,766 lawmakers over the past 54 years. Until the law school opened in 2009, it was the only channel to become a lawyer. People in need were praised for creating the "" dragon of the stream "" and accused of creating the "" gongnagi, "" as they could achieve their dream of success. Beginning next year, only law school graduates will be allowed to take the bar exam. The day the final successful candidates of the final bar exam were announced, the Society for Judicial Testing and Management held a press conference and announced, "" If you are to announce to a generation of law school students, you are going to have to drop your current law school, which serves as a ladder to move the law school. "" The judicial examination, which produced the last 55 successful candidates, including Park, will disappear into history. Lim Sun-young, reporter Youngcan Joongang.co.crk."
