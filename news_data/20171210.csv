Various predictions are coming out about the performance of Samsung's next premium smartphone Galaxy S9. Galaxy S9 is expected to perform at its highest level with the industry's highest internal memory and the latest application processor (AP). According to the industry on July 10, Samsung Electronics ' next premium smartphone Galaxy S9 is estimated to have a built-in memory capacity of up to 512GB and is equipped with Qualcomma`s latest AP, Snapshot Dragon 845. Samsung is expected to unveil the Galaxy S9 at the world`s largest mobile exhibition, Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2017, to be held in Barcelona, Spain as early as late next February. This is because Samsung Electronics announced recently that it will produce 512GB of Universal Flash Storage for the next-generation mobile devices. The 512GB eUFS is twice the capacity size of the traditional 256GB product. This makes it suitable for smartphones that need thinner, smaller and better performance. Galaxy Note 8 can also expand up to 512GB of memory with the micro SD card, but it is slower because it takes a single step. With 512GB eUFS, ultra-quality (full HD) images can be transferred to the solid state drive (SSD) in 6 seconds, more than 8 times faster than the micro- SDD. "" Samsung Electronics did not mention specific products such as the Galaxy S9 or the Galaxy Note 9 model when it announced the mass production of 512GB, "" an industry expert said, adding, "" this smartphone market is expected to have a 512GB eU FS FS eU model model in its lineup. "" Additionally, the Galaxy S9 is likely to have Qualcomm's latest AP Snapdragon 845. Qualcomm recently unveiled the next AP, Snapshot dragon 845. SNAP DragonMore 845 has seen an 18 percent improvement in performance compared to the snap-through 835 released earlier this year, and its electricity efficiency is about 15 percent higher. It is known to be specialized in biometric authentication, voice recognition and AI. The first snap-driven 835 was applied to the Galaxy S8 earlier this year, but the snap-driven 845 is also likely to be included in the Galaxy S9. Jeong Eun-seung, head of Samsung Electronics ' foundry business department, told Qualcomm Dragon Tech Summit 2017 in Maui, the U.S. on July 5 (local time), "" We will continue to improve performance, and Samsung Electronics foundry's technology will continue to improve performance. "" As the high-end models continue to be rolled out in the premium smartphone market, Samsung Electronics, the No. 1 maker of the industry, could also have set its sights on getting the best smartphones out, industry watchers say Apple's iPhone. ronia@fnnews.com reporter Lee Seol-young yesterday urged the public to pass through Seoul City Hall of Professional News and the Seoul Metropolitan Council to pass through October 9. "" The student has put the hot pack they prepared for the night under the blanket and put the hot pack under the blanket. "" "" I couldn't pass through the night before I opened my dorm, "" they said. The unprotected cheek has long been numb with cold. The weather app for smartphones in front of Seoul City Hall on July 5 was - 4 degrees. "" Many places recorded the lowest temperatures this winter, "" the Korea Meteorological Administration said on the same day. "" We knew today was the coldest day, but we had to leave. What was more scary than the cold was the security deposit and the monthly rent worries me. Our university students can not wait any longer. '' The bill to build the seventh residence, which was once postponed during a review session in June this year, was canceled by some of the committee members last month and was not even reviewed. Lee Kyung-eun, president of Hanyang University's student union, said, I can't even express my opinion by visiting the City Hall one or two times in the past year to open a dorm, and I was only surprised when the panel members attended the deliberation on the issue on July 15. According to the student union, the price around the school is guaranteed 10 million won and 500,000 won per month. It is twice as expensive as the school dorm, which costs 180,000 to 260,000 won per month (based on double room) without guarantee. The cold is not enough to last a day, but the students were pursued throughout the two years by the bond with high guarantees and the pain of the rent. She could not afford the monthly rent with only a short time job, and when she got help from her parents, she felt more sorry.▽ New Seoul = Seoul City decided on May 7 to revise the plan to build a second floor underground facility (school) for Hanyang University from the 17th, Hangham-dong, Seongdong-gu, Seoul National University The accommodation rate at Hanyang University in Seoul has increased to 12.5 percent this year from 11.5 percent last year. The figure is still below the Seoul National University's average of 16.8 percent. In an attempt to solve the problem, the school announced its plan to build new dormitories in 2015. Soon, neighboring rental companies were opposed. The logic is that if a dormitory that can accommodate up to 1450 people at a time is built, people will be threatened with livelihood. After two years of opposition, the building was reduced from the 10th floor to the 7th floor and its seating capacity was also reduced to around 800. Dormitory was less than planned, but the tenants were not backing down. According to the student council, 30-40 residents who opposed the construction of the dormitory cheered in front of students who wanted to pass the deliberation when the deliberation failed on July 15. "" I don't think it's that hard to say whether you want to get out of this tight residential environment and study, "" said student council president Lee Kyung-kyung. "" I don't think people ask you to come early in the morning. Furthermore, it was the citizens of the Dubul Minjoo Party who taught the news to residents. Politicians in the government and the ruling Uri Party, who promised to secure 50,000 dormitories by 2022 on the "" Housing Welfare Roadmap "" on July 29, are now opposed to setting up a 800-strong dorm. The students said, "" Irony. "" Kim Young-hoe, a 20-year-old student from Gangneung, Gangwon Province, said, The program has been seen by lawmakers and the new government as a way to deal with youth housing issues. I feel like all I have to do is be good at what I see outside. The earlier suspension of deliberations is also because the committee members voted on the fifth bill and suddenly lost their seat in the slogan for the young man, who was supposed to deal with the sixth Hanyang University dorm proposal. For elected politicians, local residents voted for what they would see as the election, rather than the signatures of 2857 students, the petition of a 1885 official and a single "" single message to the mayor "" of Seoul since early this year.▽ New Seoul = Students of Hanyang University declared their ' Waiting for Han Yang to pass the deliberation on building a dormitory ' in front of Seoul City Hall on July 5, and held an overnight meeting until then. The baked potato, hoppang, and canned coffee brought out by students cheering for the vigil held at limj@newsis.com were chilled out quickly. There was also a forecast for snow in Seoul early next day. He also decided to take turns to go to nearby fast food restaurants after 11 p.m. to warm up. The decision to change the detailed facility planning of Hanyang University, which has plans to build new dormitories, was the first item on the agenda of the city planning committee on Monday. The deliberation began at 2:00 p.m. and at 2:34 p.m., about 25 hours and half of the vigil, Facebook posted an article that said Hanyang University Dormitory has finally been passed. I took a breather but it is too early to pop the champagne. The ball went to Seongdong-gu Office, which is the building permit authority. The opposition committee will put the brakes on the building's pre-procedure processes, such as the transportation impact assessment and environmental impact assessment. Students may now have to set up their seats in front of the district office, not the City Hall. At a press conference on the second day, Professor of Architecture at Hanyang University in Seoul said, "" Let's put a straw in the next generation where the older people who live with us say they have buildings and land to live comfortably without paying taxes.

"▽ Concern about futures deals and influence on the introduction of regulations = Gu Jeong-mo, a reporter at Yonhap news agency, has announced a steep rise in the price of switchcoins due to a sharp decline in the price of futures. According to the rain on July 10, one-bit coins were traded at 14,489,000 won as of 2:50 p.m. of that day. Two days ago, he went up to 24.48 million won on July 8, but dropped about 40 percent two days ago. This is the exact opposite of the way he has been on a roll recently. Bitcone broke the 10 million won mark at 3:10 p.m. on July 26 and broke the 20 million mark at midnight on July 8 only 11. The decline in the bit-coint[Conference Information Photo] Bitcone price is interpreted as a result of the combination of concerns about the negative impact of the futures transaction on Bit-coins and regulatory news. Bitcone is about to debut in the institutional financial market. Chicago Options Exchange (CBOE) and the Chicago Futures Exchange (CME) are scheduled to start trading on July 10 (local time) and on November 18. The Chicago Board of Options Exchange will start trading on the Bitcone futures starting at 5:00 p.m. local time on July 10 and at 8:00 a.m. Korean time on July 11. Experts point out that when futures are traded, the price of futures acts as a predictor to stabilizing the deal, but on the other hand, the impact of the futures transaction may also alter the price significantly. As a result, the price of Bitcone has decreased around the world. According to the coin base of the Virtual Monetary Exchange in the United States, the rate of change from $ 17,638 at 10:30 a.m. on July 8 dropped 21 percent to $ 13,853 at 3:00 p.m. The analysis shows that Korea's decline is twice as steep as that of the U.S. due to the introduction of regulations. As the price of Bitcone continues to soar, the Justice Ministry`s Joint Task Force, led by the Ministry of Government Virtual and Monetary Authority, will meet next week to discuss government regulations. We are closely watching the market as the fluctuations in virtual currency values, including Bitcone, have reached a significant level, a government official said, correcting the approach to the domestic virtual currency speculation that is close to a gale. The government has not proposed any specific measures yet, but some observers say that regulations such as limiting the amount of investment or the qualifications of investment are being introduced. Bitcone prices, which have shown signs of overheating for the short time, seem to have begun to take a breather from the news of the government`s introduction of regulations, Bristom officials said. ▶ pseudojm@yna.co.kr driver information and contact (Click!) the latest fashion trend area, all (Click!)

In India, it seemed natural to keep away from pedestrians and keep honking horns. On the same day, pedestrians were walking dangerously between the exterior wall management crane and the vehicle.

""" Police are investigating charges … that's not the case because it's a dead dog. "" About 30,000 people agreed in a posting on the Web site of a presidential petition asking for stronger punishment for the elderly who witnessed the scene. Incheon Gyeyang Police Station announced on July 10 that it booked three elderly citizens in their 70s on charges of embezzling their shares, including those in the late 70s and B (76) without detention. A and B are accused of starting a fire with a deadly weapon and cutting the dead dog's body in a vacant lot near a girls ' middle school in Gyeyang-gu, Incheon at noon on July 29.

A few days before the crime, he took the dead dog from the restaurant's corrosion-storage and asked his friends to take the piece to make a dog drink.Police booked A and others for embezzlement of shares, believing they would have a dog owner. Animals are classified as objects by civil law. However, since the crime can not be applied without the dogs ' owners, the police will consider changing the charge to violate the Waste Management Act. We could not apply the crime in the first place because the suspects did not kill a live dog, said a police official, who is involved in the investigation, and we are reviewing the final laws. Meanwhile, a middle school student who witnessed the scenes of the crime posted an article titled, "" Please step up punitive animal crimes, "" on the public petition website of the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae last month.

Sinopark @ No more.] An 119 ambulance went to the alley in Itaewon, Yongsan-gu, Seoul, to carry citizens who were injured by the assault at around 1:57 a.m. yesterday. ▽ Photo = Han Min-seon's sister, Seoul Kalba, saw the temperature fall below 10 degrees below zero, but at the end of the year, Bulgeum, Seoul, was very familiar. Police cars went on and on in the entertainment district, making loud sirens among the drunken hornets. As the year-end party began, the entire district and the police box were put on alert. As usual, drunk people have taken over the welfare centers this year. Those who are drunk are on the brink of losing their ability to protect their lives. Some say that the government should change the society's culture that is tolerant of alcohol. With cheerful music playing every 10 p.m. on October 8, Itaewon in Yongsan-gu, Seoul had a Christmas atmosphere. Every shop was decorated with tree decorations and people dressed up in costumes enjoyed year-end parties everywhere. A 28-year-old office worker with a box of cakes in her hand said, I bought it at the end of the year, not my birthday, and said, I plan to celebrate my good times this year with my friends. But as it was getting closer to midnight, joy began to turn into bitterness everywhere. There were strays in the streets of Itaewon. Around 11:45 p.m., a woman collapsed on the street as if drunk. The group helped him, but could hardly regain consciousness. Police who were called out examined the woman's condition. After midnight on July 9, around 1:57 a.m., an ambulance arrived in the back street of Itaewon. Next to him, a man in a suit was bleeding from the face. We had a fight with a passerby. Another man had torn his shirt off. Itaewon Police Box, located in the neighborhood, was literally a stinker. The drunken group of people came in without a break. From 1:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., more than 20 drunk people visited the police box, which was about 10 pyeong or more. Police look for the smell sleep Monday morning in front of Gangnamdo (left), Gangnam-gu, and Itaewon Police Box Office, Yongsan-gu, which are drunk and unconscious. ▽ Pictures = The case of reporter Han Min-seon and Park ChI-hyeon is one of the cases, but it is the people who are too drunk to bother police officers. Around 2 a.m., three police officers were called in to stop a man right in front of Itaewon Police Box. The man complained in informal language to the police officers who woke him up, and then jumped into the driveway. Police were again hanging on to the man without stopping, and managed to move him to a safe place to check his I.D. and take him inside the police box. At a similar time, drunk people were making a scene at Seocho Police Box, which was in charge of the entertainment area around Gangnam. One man in his 40s went in and out of his house and opened the door of the police box and began shouting, "" What can I say, I waited three hours! "" He complained that he had not caught a taxi home. Police tried to soothe the drunk people with words "" I understand, "" but the man raged for nearly half an hour. When I finally locked the door of the police box, I left. It is like pumping out social anger here, said Ryu Jae-woon, head of Seocho 2 Police Box, who usually resells public office parking lots of other tasks as it is difficult to apply them. Violence against alcohol also continued. Around 1:00 a.m., a man in his 20s, bleeding, entered the police box and complained of being assaulted. It was because they got into a fight because they bumped into each other in a karaoke booth. Things that might not happen if they were not drunk are constantly being repeated. In many cases, people go beyond alcohol to crime. According to police, among the five most violent crimes committed during the past five years, 27.5 percent (707,8794) of the last five were drunk. Police, who have been closely watching the drunk Korean people's faces, agree that Korea should change its tolerant culture to drink as soon as possible. Lee, who is in a state of lost consciousness and can not remember what happened, said Shin Sang-ho, head of the Itaewon Police Box, adding, It is good to have a culture that enables us to enjoy ourselves without alcohol by changing our drinking culture.

""" Precision Anti-surgery Attack Bill "" by the Clinton Administration -- "" The surgical strike plan "" was also estimated by the U.S. Forces 52,000 (South Korea) in 1990, and South Korean troops 490,000 (New York) because of its "" President-President Strike Plan "" [China, which was published in 1990]. The National Security Archive, affiliated with the George Washington University, summed up the statements made by key U.S. government figures in a confidential document released on July 8 (local time), and reports by government agencies. William Perry, who served as a special envoy to the North and the Ministry of Defence during the Clinton administration in December 1998, Kim Dae-jung in his meeting with South Korean president that the United States in 1994, North Korean nuclear crisis.When the war unfolded his plans said. The fact is timely in a document that the U.S. Embassy in Korea reported to the U.S. State Department based on a documentary it obtained from Cheong Wa Dae. Perry stressed at the time, "" Of course, when we join forces with the United States, we can win the war without a doubt, but we can make a lot of casualties in the process. "" The U.S. Defense Department estimated that if war broke out on the Korean Peninsula within 90 days, it would cause a major surgical strike, which would result in an all-out attack, even though 52,000 U.S. soldiers and 490,000 Korean soldiers were in danger. In relation to this, the magazine said, more than 1 million people are expected to die and the cost of the U.S. war will reach $ 61 billion, including 52,000 U.S. soldiers and 490,000 Korean troops. Don Oberdorfer (1931-2015), an expert on the Korean Peninsula, also quoted such an estimate from the Defense Ministry in the book, ' Two Koreas ' (The Two Koreas).The B-1b Lancer said its North Korea policy contained sanctions involving carrots and sticks, but later pointed out that discussion of military options was minimal. "" This may be the result of the Clinton administration's review of the impact of the use of military options on North Korea in 1994, "" he explained. Perry urged diplomatic efforts at a recent seminar hosted by the Arms Control Association (ACA) in Washington D.C. He warned that a full-scale war against North Korea would become a nuclear war, which would cause casualties on a similar scale to World War I and II without the intervention of China. Despite its distance from North Korea`s military options, the Clinton administration, like the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations, was also confirmed to have sent a strong message that it can not tolerate nuclear armament. According to a State Department report by U.S. Embassy Zhu Baizing in June 1999, Perry visited Pyongyang as a special envoy that year to pass along warnings from the U.S. administration to North Korean leaders. Perry described long-range missiles that reach the U.S. mainland and threaten South Korea and Japan as unacceptable. They warned that if the nuclear program is continued, there would be a serious negative effect on North Korea. Former U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry has been confirmed to have taken a serious precautions not only against North Korea's nuclear program but also the risk of a collapse due to famine. The State Department data on the Korean Peninsula compiled in 1997 and 1998 showed concern by the State Department that the hungry North Korea`s economic hardship could cause a dangerous confusion. U.S. officials said, As such, the four-party approach should be flexible enough to encompass a wide range of options from meaningful reforms that would give North Korea new impetus to the collapse of the North Korean regime. The Clinton administration is also known to have been careful not to break the Geneva Agreement with North Korea due to the dominance of North Korean hard-liners after refusing to review the 1994 war. According to the State Department report in April 1998, the United States of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul Kim Dae-jung at the time of this ahead of a visit to Washington in June that year of the president asked in South Korea. U.S. State Department Vice Minister for Political Affairs Thomas Pickering was concerned that "" if North Korea felt that we were going to fail to make a promise to them, they would find a reason to abandon their promise to us. "" The U.S. felt that North Korea could resume its nuclear program if it saw signs of betrayal of the agreement. Such remarks came amid a delay in the construction of light-water reactors in North Korea and the supply of heavy oil pushed for by KEDO under the Agreed Framework. The National Security Archive explained, "" These documents reveal that the Clinton administration did not have unrealistic hopes of quickly and easily resolving the security issues on the Korean Peninsula. "" Washington then summarized its aim for a mechanism that would give North Korea complete and verifiable guarantees not to possess nuclear weapons. However, the National Security Documentation Office reported that the North's stance has completely changed since the Bush administration took office. Perry explained Clinton administration's North Korea strategy, and for his successor, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, Powell also "" With the old carrying on the conversations and successfully.We will finish the fence is there but ended up in The former president is that North Korea halted the conversation.Drive direct communication with the United States and North Korea [Production Chosun Johain] Photos.com.

The main reason why patients had to pay full medical bills because they did not have health insurance coverage, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasound, was the reason why Koreans spent more money on medical services.In relation to this, the government is planning to apply all medical expenses except beauty and plastic surgery to the health insurance coverage group by 2022. By doing so, the government is planning to increase the guarantee rate of health insurance to 70 percent, from the current 63.2 percent.In particular, MRI, ultrasound of heart and chest disorders, cognitive function tests of nerves at vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, children and women, and screening of innate metabolic disorders will be turned into pay items throughout this year and next.

"○ Car sales forecast to reach 4 million units by 2030? How about a $ 2,000 per month (about 2.2 million won) Porch-Pastport service with anytime, anywhere rental cars? The idea of telling the truth has come true. Porsche launched its subscription service, Porsche Paspot, from Atlanta, U.S. For only $ 2,000 per month (approximately 2.2 million won), the app offers a choice of eight variants, including Cayenne, Makan and Bakster. If one pays an extra $ 1,000 (about 1.1 million won), he or she will have a wider choice of 22 models. There is a new phenomenon of car subscription, such as in newspapers and magazines. From now on, consumers will be able to sign a deal with Hyundai or Genesis, and have a range of cars for a certain time, without having to buy the Sonata or Grandeur on their own. It is a new kind of service that looks like a mix of rental car and car sharing. Why did Porsche decide to rent their expensive car instead of selling a new one? "" It is an attempt on the younger generation, "" Porsche said. In the United States, the current 20 - to 34-year-old people who experienced the global financial crisis during their teenage years are referred to as the "" recession generation. "" Unlike their parents ' generation, they are very stingy with spending, including paying for cars and homes.

Hyundai Kia Motors ` global sales target for next year has also decreased by about 10 percent from this year's (82.5 million units). It is unusual for the group to reduce its annual sales target. "" Quantitative growth is important, but the advent of new technologies such as autonomous cars and electric cars may not have led to the shift in the car era from being ' ridden, ' "" a Hyundai official said. In the domestic market, consumers under the age of 30 are less likely to buy the first car.

An industry insider said, "" Although Korea has other factors unlike the United States, such as rising youth unemployment and rising wedding age. "" However, the recent trend shows that it is not going to sell cars to consumers in the future. One way that Chung has suggested for qualitative growth is through the shift in Micah's concept : "" Car Sharing. "" Hyundai is currently seeking a business alliance with AJ Car. If it takes over the rental car company, Hyundai can try a new business model in carshaaring. For example, it is possible to obtain a fixed income by charging a monthly fee from the consumers or rental car companies, not by the consumers. Hyundai Motor already operates trial car sharing services around the world. Last October, the company launched a car sharing service in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, with 100 ' Ionic Electronic ' cars. Hyundai is the first European service to consist entirely of electric vehicles (EVs). Korea will also have a free nose or car sharing service with Hyundai Capital for two nights by next February. To use the Dilka service, download the mobile app and enter your ID, password, name (real name) and driver's license number. Only persons who have obtained a driver's license and who have been older than one year are allowed to subscribe. U.S. Car Sharing Service Like South Korea, German car sales are also decreasing. Germany registered more than 400,000 new cars a month until 2009, but the figure stood at an average of 360,000 a month. The industry predicts that the figure will fall to the level of 300,000 by 2020. In 2008, the German subsidiary of Mercedes-Benz started Kartugo to share vehicles. A total of 14,000 units are currently operating in 26 cities around the world. KartugarI is available in seven cities only in Germany. The rental fee is 26 euros (350 won) per minute, 17.90 euros (24,000 won) for two hours ' driving, and 79 euros (107,000 won) for a day's rent. Dieter James Daimler, chief executive officer of the Deuterce Diamer Group, said in January, We will also put Mercedes-Benz luxury cars in Katugo. BMW established a subsidiary called DriveSNow in Munich, Germany, where it headquartered in 2011. The latecomer settled down with strategy to provide his brand Minnie with popular models such as BMW electric cars, SUVs and sedans. European regions currently provide about 5,400 units. Toyota Motor Corp. of Japan is also looking for new business opportunities in car sharing. This is because the domestic market decreased 30 percent from 7.89 million units in 1990 to 5.5 million units last year. Toyota has formed a strategic partnership by investing $ 100 million (about 110 billion won) in Uber and also invested $ 10 million (approximately 11 billion won) in U.S. car sharing company Gearound. 100 vehicles will be provided to Grab-sharp, which provides car sharing services such as Wuber in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. Ford acquired the commuter van Charriatt last September. The growth of car-sharing services may also have an influence on the value chain (value chain) of the car market, in conjunction with the evolution of Autonomous Driving Technologies. Chairman of the Import Car Association Yoon Dae-seong said, "" We have no choice but to use the app as a vehicle sharing medium. We have no choice but to rely on the influence of platforms operators such as Google, who can not afford to avoid having to rely on our own applications and develop their own services "" Kim Young-min, reporter of Bradkim @ononging.co. krting Hyundai Motor, Conna-Santapero Ltd.

Citing the gravity of the Taiwan issue, Lee said, "" The recent passage of the Defense Authorization Act by the U.S. Congress dealt with bilateral visits by U.S. and Taiwanese warships, which runs counter to the spirit of a joint statement during the normalization of ties between China and the United States.

"" The seven major issues were selected jointly by six leading Korean security firms : Anrab, East Security, HaurI, NHTSA, Inca Internet and Light Scan.Next year's cyber attack was on virtual currency such as Bitcone. As the size of the virtual currency exchange and its transaction rapidly grow, the number of attacks on the exchange itself will increase. Other attacks include one requiring virtual currency to encrypt major programs or files and then break them, and another attack on the virtual currency exchange and the users ' electronic wallets will occur.North Korea was cited as the main target of the attack. We have seen some attempts to attack the local virtual currency in 2014, said Moon Jong-hyun, director of East Security at the Korea Exchange. KISA predicted that North Korea would attempt to break into the internal system through the consultation office of the exchange rather than directly attacking the server. In addition, phishing sites posing as Bitcone Exchange were also expected to appear.The attacks on the financial sector, such as ATM manufacturers, banks and securities companies, are also expected to continue. Ransomware, which encrypts important files, was feared to inject unknown vulnerabilities into the system and abuse not only money but terrorism. "" We expect more ' Janus ' lanceware with data encryption and system destruction in mind, "" Moon explained, "" but it could be for cyber terrorism.

In addition, it will prepare a device to increase the security of IoT device and strengthen support by researching Ransom Ware recovery technologies and cooperating with related agencies.

"Park Cho-rong, a reporter at Yonhap News Agency, is going on a road diet that reduces lanes on major roads and extends them. According to Seoul City on July 10, the city will reduce the number of cars between Eulji-ro (3.7km), Toegye-ro (1.2km) and Sejong-daero (1.55km) by 6. .-kilometer) total, and set up the transportation plan accordingly. Seoul Metropolitan City in Seoul was designated as the country`s first special zone for promoting green transportation in March, allowing the city to manage strong traffic demand, including limiting the use of cars. Reducing cars to the road is one of the key measures to reduce the number of vehicles entering the city and thus make it easier to walk and reduce dust. The Seoul Metropolitan Government has decided to consider reducing Toegyero 2-5 from the two sides to the fourth. Use cars to reduce the number or width of the car to secure a walking space. Toegyero is a busy place with many visitors as it has Myeong-dong and Namdaemun Market and cars parked along the side of the road to transport things. The Seoul Metropolitan Government is planning to improve the congested road and make the place easier for tourists and pedestrians to visit. Since the Seoul Station building was closed, traffic has dropped in Toegye-ro, as a result. Euljiro is a reporter (Seoul = Yonhap news agency) with six cars in both directions, but vehicles and motorcycles carrying goods often make up the outer lanes. The 3.7-kilometer section from Seoul City Hall to Dongdaemun History Park will also be considered for reduction from the sixth to fourth. The Seoul Metropolitan Government is planning to begin construction in 2019 after it has made a basic design for realigning the road spaces of Toegye-ro, Eulji-ro, during the next year. It is expected that when more walking space is extended through the reorganization of road spaces, people will gather and local rights and tours will be activated, the Seoul Metropolitan Government said. The reduction of the car to Sejongdae station, which runs from Gwanghwamun intersection to Seoul Station, is in line with the re-building of Gwanghwamun Plaza. Seoul City has decided to reduce the 10 lanes of the 1.5-kilometer section to eight lanes and add walking space and bike paths, but it may vary depending on the plan. The city will take steps to conduct feasibility study and examine investment in realigning road spaces to Sejong University sometime next year. The project will total 1.85 billion won. The Seoul Metropolitan Government is in the forefront of creating "" good walking "" and reducing fine dust, but it is expected to face strong opposition in the process of reducing the number of cars. Euljiro 1-ga and Toegye-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul, is a sixth round trip, but it is virtually a fourth round trip. Euljiro 1-ga is mostly owned by trucks and motorcycles by rows of lights, hardware and print shops on either side. If two lanes are shortened, the speed of the road will decrease, and the truck will get entangled, creating a potential for severe congestion. Some worry that if the pedestrian walkways are extended, the number of unauthorised items at shopping malls, which still account for a substantial portion of news coverage, could grow. The Seoul Metropolitan Government opened 7017 to Seoul and reduced six lanes near Hoehyeon Station to five lanes. The Seoul Metropolitan Government is not determined to reduce the amount by car. Considering the traffic situation and the opinions of residents and merchants, we will seek to reduce the amount to cars, said a city official. The Seoul Metropolitan Government had previously decided to reduce two lanes between Hoehyeon Station and Toegyero 2-ga along with the opening of Seoul Station 7017, but changed the plan to reduce one because of resistance from residents and worries of worsening traffic. Measures to reduce the number of cars are also needed. It is clear that reducing lanes will slow down the car speed, said a city official, who said, We will consider minimizing the negative effects of the reduction, such as inducing a detour of vehicles. chopark@yna.co.kr Today, snow is still falling in Gangwon and parts of the metropolitan area.

"Hyundai Camry, CEO of Hyundai Motor Company, is known to have raised its interest in the Korean car market. In the wake of the financial crisis, light cars were called ` national cars `. Then the "" Avante "" type listened to the national car, followed by the "" Sonata "" type to become a best-selling car, and now the "" Super Grander "" type is listening to the national car. Grander sold 123,000 units between January and November of this year, far ahead of Avante and 76,384 sales during the same period. More than 10,000 units were sold every month, excluding October.If you select imported cars that correspond to granders in terms of price, size and performance, they are Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, and Nissan Altima. The three Japanese sedan models are the true world car that has long been loved by the U.S. market, where global makers compete. It is also known as the "" car that can be purchased without asking "" in the United States because it is a epitome of a car that has no problems.Unlike the U.S., it is clear that the three models are behind Grander in Korea. However, the import car industry reports that some consumers who want to buy Grander cars have an air current flowing into the Japanese sedan. The growth of the domestic quasI-car market itself is also attributable to the growing attention of Japanese sedans.Import carmakers say consumers who can not afford premium imports but don`t want to buy the luxury cars anymore are the main drivers of Japanese sedans. The price difference from Grandeur is also a strong point for the three Japanese sedans.Against this backdrop, the rivalry between the three cars grew stronger as Toyota launched its Camry full change cars here last September. The Japanese sedan Three Kingdoms has recently been reinvigorated in the imported car market.KamrI first of the three cars. The 8th generation new Camry created a sensation in October by selling 344 gasoline models and 423 hybrid models. This time Camry is marked by innovations in design. Toyota's key design, Keen look, has turned into a highly dynamic model. The large radiator grille is a symbol of change, with its openness to the bottom.Camry came in two forms, gasoline (35.9 million won) and hybrid (42.5 million won). Petrol models with a 2.5 litre self-inspiration engine and an 8-speed automatic gearbox produce a maximum output of 207 horsepower and a maximum torque of 24.8 kg · m. Combined fuel efficiency is 12.3 km / liter. The hybrid combines the electric motor and the unauthorised transmission (CVT) with the same engine to achieve stronger performance and better fuel efficiency (167kmh). The car's marketing slogan, set by Toyota Korea, is "" wild hybrid. ""Next is Accord, which makes it on top of the import vest-selling car monthly. It is so well marketed to the imported car industry that it is considered the most mysterious event of the year. Even though an old model with a completely revised car is out of date next year, 4,495 gasoline models and 1,678 hybrids were sold this year. In October, the company sold more than 800 units of gasoline and hybrids, which were also very strong.Accord has the longest history of any of the three cars. Back in 1976, the first generation model came out. An importer of cars said, "" It is the same image of stability, quality and a solid identity based on the collective technology and know-how that "" changed into the 9th generation and was loved globally. "" Most of Arcord's new customers are owners of Korean cars, according to Honda Korea.Acord is charged gasoline (35.4 million won) and hybrid (43.2 million won). Petrol models with 2.4 litres and e- CVT transmissions have a maximum output of 188 horsepower and a maximum torque of 25 kg and m, and a combined fuel efficiency of 12.6 km/h (50 %).

The car sold better this year than it did at launch. Last May, 257 cars were sold, but 417 were sold this May.Korea`s Nissan officials said Altima is constantly recommended and quoted as saying, The biggest feature of Altima is that it has no demerit mark in design, performance, convenience, safety and price.Most importantly, the price is a strong point. Nissan Korea has set an aggressive price of around 20 million won (29.9 million won) for its Altima model. Altima combines a gasoline 2.5 litre engine with an X-Tronick CVT to produce maximum power of 180 horsepower and maximum torque of 245 kg and m. Combined fuel costs 12.5 ㎞.cm.

According to the Korea Meteorological Administration, Seoul's snow fell 4.3 centimeters as of 10:00 a.m. yesterday. As a result, traffic on the mountain road between the entrance of Samcheong-dong Park and Seoul apartments was blocked from early in the morning. Heavy roads were cleared of snow overnight, but due to the fact that many areas of the roads have turned to ice, the cars are not moving fast enough. Cars are walking at a snail's pace, with snow and melted ice covering the residential area. Cars can not get to the side of the road on the snowy slope. A car was unable to get off the road in the residential area near Ahyeon station and stopped at the entrance to the uphill, while the rest drove slower than passers-by. India's snow remained so thick that its citizens were cautious of walking. Passers-in-law wore thick padding or coats to avoid the cold, but kept their arms in a balance by swinging their arms and not putting their hands in their pockets.

"Unconventional warfare task force agents donghae to conduct training and to infiltration from coast to coast in a rubber raft. The highlight of the movie Zero Dark Seaty (2012), which depicts the operation to remove al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden in the Army, is the scene in which De VG RU .rad, a special U.S. naval force, scuffs at the Pakistani hiding place. The scene, in which special forces aboard the infiltration special helicopter went through the darkness to break into Pakistani airspace, and fell to Bin Laden's hiding place, was impressed by the profound process that led to his death.Maybe that's why. It is easy to see examples of bin Laden's removal operations on the mission of the Special Forces on the Decaderation Unit of Kim Jong-un, officially established on July 1. The Special Forces team, composed of about 1000 members, is reorganized by reinforcing soldiers and special warfare equipment and specializing in missions of one of the special forces brigade units. Unlike the special forces brigade, which carries out a variety of tasks, including preparing for a local provocation, infiltration into the North's rear areas and occupation of military facilities, the Special Forces focus on removing North Korea`s war leadership. Most analysts say the North will play a key role in massive retaliation (KMPR), which is a preemptive strike when signs of using nuclear weapons are clear.Few remember, however, that the real hero of the movie Zero Dark Sooty was not a special unit member but a CIA agent who tracked bin Laden for many years. This suggests that the information is more important than the special forces in the operation to remove the North Korean war leadership, but it is not easy to find evidence of concern inside and outside the military.U.S. troops in Iraq have installed communications equipment and are waiting for a communication to take place. Actual operations, including the removal of key role war leaders by information assets, take less than 30 minutes to penetrate the target site, remove the target and escape. But they spend a long and long time collecting information to make the mission a success in such a short time. Even if they focus on collecting information like this, the operation might not be successful.Let's take a look at the removal process of Osama bin Laden, who is believed to be the main example of the beheading operation. Bin Laden was killed on May 2, 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan by a U.S. Special Forces unit. The U.S. government spent 13 years doing so. The U.S. set up a special department at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in August 1998 to track down bin Laden. However, it failed to stop the September 11 attacks in 2000, and 11 years had passed since the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States before the killing of bin Laden. In the process, the CIA used hundreds of agents to capture, win over al-Qaida agents and their allies, gather information, and sent unmanned reconnaissance planes to explore Afghanistan and Pakistan. National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies also collected signal and video information and followed bin Laden. Though the U.S. has the world's highest intelligence capability, it failed several times in the process of killing bin Laden.The U.S. Special Forces in October 1993 and the Battle of Mogamosco, Somali rebels, tried to arrest Somali warlord Mohamed Iddid were examples of failures stemming from intelligence gathering. CIA and U.S. Army intelligence forces infiltrated Mokagus, Somalia's capital, and tracked the whereabouts of Iddid, but failed to achieve results, and radio bugging by the Iddid warlords failed. As information collection failed, the Delta Force had to carry out four fruitless raids. After confirming the delta force's move, Iddid strengthened its defense posture in preparation for the attack, resulting in the deaths of 16 U.S. Special Forces personnel.Members of the special forces are on guard at the saju while training for the cold weather at Hwangbyeongsan Mountain in Gangwon Province. How about our army? Professor Jang Young-keun of the Air Force attended the National Defense Agency audit session on October 13, saying, The biggest problem the military has is the timely information on North Korea`s military trends. Information received from the U.S. military or allies is not timely. Though the government should get the information it needs at the right time, it is inevitable that its one-time-long information provided by the U.S. military and its allies will leave a vacuum in surveillance. In order to constantly move to the Korean Peninsula and to remove the North Korean war leaders who will lead the North Korean military, surveillance assets should be secured for real-time intelligence collection, but the pace of related projects should be sluggish. From next year's defense budget, which was set to be approved by the National Assembly, the semi-disciplined unmanned aerial reconnaissance plane (UAVs) was decided to cost 136.6 billion won, down 27.6 billion won from the previous government's proposal. The budget for improving the performance of patrol aircraft, which can be used to collect information in case of emergency, was also set at 54.4 billion won, down 4.5 billion won from the previous administration. As the 405-year project to independently develop spy satellites was delayed by three years, the rental supply of spy satellites to cover gaps in information was cut by 1 billion won next year. It is hard to avoid pointing out that the military has ignored the fact that it can not lend the spy satellite, a highly strategic asset. Critics say the government is trying to pass the burden of removing North Korea's war leaders onto its special task brigade without any proper information.U.S. Special Forces with Personal Radio Communication (US-Specific) are moving quickly past the opening and into the operational area. The U.S. Defense Department provided the Special Forces with a repeat of North Korea`s nuclear tests, promoting the creation of a special task brigade from 2019 to 2017. However, most of the equipment needed for the unit to perform its actual operations is not in action. Four C-130 upgraded planes that will support infiltration into North Korea have not been fully deployed. Special operational helicopters that have upgraded the CH-47s are under development. Special operational machine guns, bullet grenades, suicide bombers and unmanned reconnaissance aircraft are expected to take up to several years to introduce, with a deposit of 340 million won from next year`s defense budget. What is serious is that many of the equipment stated to be necessary for special mission brigade operations are suitable for special warfare missions formerly performed by special forces forces forces forces. Portable ladders, tactical backlash, noise proof headphones, identification devices for noise, lightweight armor, bullet proof helmets, and internal scanners looking into the building should have been used for special operations, rather than operations to remove wartime leadership. That is why it can not avoid the criticism that the South Korean military neglected to secure equipment needed for special operations even after decades of operation of special forces.A bigger problem is that the military leadership showed no sign of serious concern over the North's removal of the North Korean war leadership.The military authorities point out that infiltration of the North's inland areas is not easy. In October 1993, 16 U.S. Special Forces helicopters, or 160 Special Aidid, were dispatched to transport Special Forces in the United States during an operation to arrest Mohammed Idid in the Somali capital. Somali rebels took the initiative in the fight by shooting down two helicopters with an RPG- - rocket, while U.S. troops escaped after a fierce battle, killing 18 people and wounding 84. Special warfare helicopters and experienced pilots with ground-to-air missile sheltering capability were dispatched but failed to stop the cheap RPG- 7 rockets.U.S. Army personnel from the 82 Airborne Division are in the process of falling off the transport aircraft and penetrating the aircraft. The removal of Osama bin Laden, called "" Successful Operation with the U.S. Army, "" was immediately possible because U.S. Special Forces penetrated by stealth helicopters undetectable by radar, and the Pakistani air force's ability to operate at night was limited. As there were not many bin Laden bodyguards, the number of troops who sent in was small. North Korea has a worse infiltration environment than Somalia or Pakistan. In Pyongyang, the Defense Command, the Guard Command, the People's Security Command, and other units of the National Security Department surround North Korean leader Kim Jong Un one by one. Water and light weapons, which are not useful for U.S. Air Force stealth fighters but can sufficiently shoot down penetrating helicopters and transport aircraft, were also deployed. Such a situation is no different in Pyongyang. Concerns are rising that if the command facility is ambushed by all units of the Special Forces on the C-130 carrier and the UH-60`s transport helicopter improvement model, the U.S. could fail to remove the wartime leadership.In case of a crisis on the Korean Peninsula, the removal of the North Korean war leadership is a strategic step to reverse the complicated situation. It is so dangerous that it can not guarantee success if the military, intelligence agencies, and other security capabilities are combined. Shortly before the battle in Mokaguas, U.S. Special Forces in Somalia requested the Defense Ministry support for 10 or 10 armored vehicles and AC-130. The result was a bleak background of American troops who withdrew from the war-torn country in disgrace. Even special military personnel, such as one-party backpacks, can not win the battle without pan-government support and a systematic operational concept. The Special Mission Brigade is not Figaro. They are the warriors who need systematic operations, operational concepts, pan-government support, and information on North Korea.Park Soo-chan, reporter of the press at psc@segye.com"
"Even the billiard room … smokers who breathe in their cigarette smoke / raise their voice in the public restrooms / the authorities ' voice / the expanding number of indoor and outdoor non-smoking areas / The smoking booth in the public non-smoking area in Seoul on July 3 was designated as the only place in the "" I could not see the cigarette in the hands of more than 20 customers who were playing pool and three or four. A customer who was in a bad business day took out a cigarette and asked, "" Hey, I don't smoke anymore. Let's go out together and kick.A sign of No Smoking Billiards is written on the afternoon of July 8 at a pool hall in Incheon on the fifth day after indoor sports facilities such as pool halls and screen golf courses were designated as non-smoking areas. ▽ Photo : When indoor sports facilities such as reporter Han Yoon-jong's pool hall were designated as non-smoking area, a large smoking booth was set up at a pool hall in Gangnam-gu, Seoul on July 7.Photo : Han Yoon-jong, a reporter at a pool hall in Seoul, said, We still have some customers who want to smoke as a habit. Sometimes customers say, ' Isn't it the season to go? Some customers say, ' If you can`t give us an ashtray, maybe we can give you a paper cup. ' In fact, some billiard rooms used an expedient method of dipping paper cups in wet tissue. Lee, 47, who owns another stadium, said, We have cleaned a table to prepare a smoking booth. Even though it costs a lot to think about the customers who don't go to the pool hall because of the smell of cigarettes and second-hand smoke, the policy might be okay. "" Most customers usually smoke 50 to 70 percent of their customers. I am also worried that it may affect my business.A week has passed since the revision to the Public Health Promotion Act last year took effect on May 3, releasing the few indoor smoking areas such as pool halls and screen golf courses from smoking. Until March 2 next year, people will be allowed 100,000 won in fines for smoking in non-smoking areas.It is as if some smokers as well as non-smokers are welcome to enforce the new law. Park (35), who met me at a pool hall, said, I hated cigarette smoke so much that I went to no smoking pool, but now I can go to any pool hall. Smokers, 39, do not like the smell of cigarettes, either. When I visited the pool hall, I could smell the clothes with tobacco. It is good to be free from second-hand smoke.However, some smokers complain about the entire smoking ban, including the one they introduced. One of the keys to billiards was to smoke when thinking about how to hit a ball when it does not fit properly, said Hong, 34. Billiards were just a last ditch for smokers, and it's a shame. If you want to sell cigarettes, you should make room to smoke, he said. Song, 33, also said, I understand that more than 70 percent of cigarette prices are taxed. If so, we should use part of the tax to set up a smoking booth that promises to give people the right to smoke.Some Japanese smokers ' booths indicate that more smoking booths are needed for smokers who are forced out into the streets with more non-smoking areas. It is necessary not only for smokers who are demeaned as "" bread worm "" and "" sucking worm, "" but also for non-smokers who are exposed to second-hand smoke. The neighboring country of Japan successfully settled its smoking booths in places where people could walk anywhere in five minutes instead of imposing high fines on smoking on most urban streets. However, smoking facilities are far from sufficient in Korea for non-smoking areas. The number of non-smoking areas inside and outside Seoul has more than tripled from 73,9391 in 2012 to 255,466 this September. However, there are only 43 smoking booths set up in 11 boroughs. There are 35 private installations and only 8 are installed by public agencies. Furthermore, ventilation facilities are not enough, and citizens can not afford to use it. On Gangnam Avenue, a famous non-smoking street, smokers only smoke on the streets, but they can easily see a large number of cigarette butts in the back street.The government agrees to the policy measures to spread the smoking booths. The establishment of smoking booths is up to the local governments, said Im Sook-young, director of the Health and Welfare Ministry. We are considering expanding non-smoking areas and discussing and expanding smoking facilities with local governments, he said. However, the tax collected with cigarettes was used to increase the number of smoking facilities, which was the opposite. There is priority in the budget, Im said. Since our aim is to improve the health of the people by reducing the smoking rate, cigarette taxes should be used in anti-smoking activities. The government will provide full support to those who want to quit smoking, such as the anti-smoking business, the anti-smoking business, and the anti-smoking promotion from middle and high schools, the official said.Nam Jeong-hoon, reporter of the China Press, che@segye.com and the worst news from the history of the Global Media World Daily anchor, seem to have tightened China's sanctions against North Korea. China's Zhongzhou Bridge, called the "" Great arteries of North China's Trade, "" was closed today. The ostensible reason is that North Korea requested repair. In fact, some analysts say China is on the verge of blocking the trade route. What is the real reason why the biggest trade route in North Korea was closed today on The Korea News 7? After closing the door, the analysis will be carried out based on the local response and even China's intention. The bridge was closed to the public because North Korea needed to repair it. No repair movements are being detected. Some even analyze that China is trying to tame North Korea. First, reports from Dandong, China by reporter Lee Tae-hyung.Dandong Jungjo Yunguigyo, the main route to Northeast China's Trade. I don't see a single truck that would normally line up long. The bridge was initially closed for ten days starting today because of North Korea's request to repair it. If the bridge is closed, travel to North Korea as well as to North Korea will be stopped. North Korea's money supply dries up overnight. But today, the first day of closure, there is no sign of repair anywhere near the bridge. Sources say, "" Everything North Korea wears and eats is delivered to the bridge. It has too much shares. Once stopped, the impact on North Korea is so great, and China doesn't care. "" The bridge is so old that it's not been fixed every year, but it's not just the spring and summer when it's so easy to get it closed, it's the winter. Some say China has begun to tame North Korea, especially since it has not been able to meet Kim Jong-un, the special envoy of Xi Jinping. China is upset because Kim Jong-un's third pig did not show up to see North Korea when Songtao, the special envoy to Pyongyang, was quoted as saying by sources. We lost face. "" Local officials say China was trying to get North Korea to hold on its back, using the pretext of asking North Korea to repair a bridge.

"Not be narrowed down, sit side by side (Muan : Yonhap News Agency) bakcheolhong Journalist : hard-featured Ahn Cheol-soo's ruling and the staff Park Ji-won, Samhyang-eup, Muan-gun, Jeollanam-do, on Thursday afternoon.Dodang at a conference held in the Company, Jeollanam-do, Uidang-myeon located in the halo as people clapping and sitting side by side. The ruling categorised as a ancheolsugye bakjjuwon party as 'Kim Dae-jung, former president of wrapping up his informant', criticism and action, is supreme council member. 2017.12.9 pch80@yna.co.kr reform era, securing 20 seats, peace be relevant … Qin'an selling jersey and walk of life and death per minute, proportional representation seems … first 'gudang reef' meeting to be no chuldangI have your attention (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) Meanwhile, Kim Dong-ho, a Journalist : Ahn Cheol-soo's ruling is not correct party's commitment to integration with people that in accordance with the suture is the integrated and both sides of the conflict.Has become virtually impossible for him to the main reason he gradually increasing. In particular, it is noteworthy that Ahn's side, which pushes for unification, is likely to have a "" consensus divorce "" among lawmakers of the ruling and southern provinces who fiercely resist it. If the party divides as the worst-case scenario, it is more likely the two sides will have to secure at least 20 seats to survive as an only child and maximize their influence on the floor. According to the 10 days of political integration opponents, the veteran to 'reform era of peace' of 'Qin'an' (Ahn Cheol-soo a) against the camp as reader influence which the administration of the heads of the Committee.Opposite fires on the grass and weeds before and after the end of the year between the two extreme conflict aspects of things can happen that coming. Integrated, chanseongpa party positioned to take a hold on both sides now are the party election is going to verge of schism, broken down in some way if a snap is predictable.Will be set up different, but 'Bian' (The Ahn Cheol-soo) the senior and chinangye it was clear that it looks. If the two sides split, whether by force of a per-minute or agreed-upon divorce, the Peace-reform Alliance should bring in at least 20 of its 39 lawmakers, the minimum terms for a floor negotiation group. It is imperative to secure 20 seats for the Castingbotter influence that the National Party has exercised so far. Currently, the ruling Debull Minjoo Party can not push ahead with any legislative tasks by itself with 121 seats in the National Assembly. The progressive Democratic Party (6), the Democratic Party (2), and the Democratic Party (DP) former National Assembly Chairman Chung Se-kyun add only 130 seats. Under these circumstances, the coalition can have a strong influence on the ruling camp by barely reaching its 150-seat majority (298 persons present). In reverse, Ahn is forced to move into desperate need to block the formation of a peace reform alliance. In fact, for the unity camp, it may not be difficult to maintain the floor negotiation group if the 11 seats of the right party members are combined. Furthermore, if the party maintains its majority in the right seat and up to five more absconders occur, the ruling party can maintain its unity with only six seats, then the nation's representative is responsible for securing 20. But when this happens, the coalition's goal of becoming a second party by consolidating itself with the right party becomes futile. If the ruling Democratic Party and the Jeolla provinces agree on the same basis and the same stance on reform issues, the main opposition Democratic Party will have no choice but to lean toward the main opposition Democratic Party when it acquires the status of a negotiating group. Eventually, the core of the people's intraparty union and opposition triumvirate is to see who wins the 20 seats they need as the castinger. Whether proportional representation should be allowed per capita is also expected to be crucial. Of the members of the National Assembly, only 23 belong to Gwangju, South Jeolla and North Jeolla provinces, but not all of them oppose unification. So if the group fails to achieve the Magic Number just with the council members, it should win over proportional representation, which is where problems arise. The current election law states, ' If a proportional representative breaks up or changes party membership except for the merger, dissolution or expulsion of a party, they will be forced to resign. ' In order for proportional representation to join the parliament-led group, the party must act as a party member to release the reform bill, and the leadership, which includes pro-operational groups, will certainly allow it to do so. One such case is Rep. Kim Hyun-ah, who remains with the GNP even though she often voted against the party line. The party has no reason to call it quits when it lowers the number of seats. Therefore, it is forecast that Gudang Elementary, a group of about 10 first-term party lawmakers, will play a major role in the process of an agreement divorce, which may occur in the future. Members of Gudang Elementary School, which is mostly located in South Jeolla Province, have expressed their opposition to Ahn's integrated drive, but refused to join the alliance and say that internal conflicts should not lead to division. Some say even the Seoul Metropolitan area district and proportional representatives are likely to back down on their opinions on the discussion. The winner of the next three contests is expected to determine which of the two is more justifiable or justifiable : Ahn's camp or a senior Honam district. dk@yna.co.kr and news reporting (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends [Click!] [graphics] [Group of 18 % last year's combined tax revenue and tax hikes are higher than last year's average of 23.6 % and 26.3 % in 2016. The national burden rate is the GDP of the year after adding the social security contributions (national pension premium, health insurance fee, and employment insurance fee) to the tax (national tax + local tax) that the people pay. As the tax boom continued to pick up last year and welfare programs were expanded, the national burden rate is expected to rise for the time being. According to the OECD on July 10, the burden rate on Koreans last year was 26.3 percent. The figure is an increase of 1.1 percentage points (p) from 25.2 percent in 2003. The Korean national burden rate has soared by the longest since 2007 when it was 1.2 percent p. Last year is the first time that the national burden rate has risen to 26 percent. The burden rate of the people has entered the 20 % range in 2000 (21.5 %). Bottle and by 24.8 percent in 2007 from 22.5 percent in 2005 after Lee Myung-bak administration policy giving tax breaks to push 2010 decreased to 23.4 percent. After fluctuations in the 24 percent range, the figure rose for the third straight year since 2014. The rise in tax burden is the reason why the national burden rate went up significantly last year. The tax burden rate jumped to a record high of 19.4 percent last year from 18.5 percent in 2015. Last year's tax revenues exceeded 300 trillion won for the first time. Tax revenues soared as much as 11.3 percent (24.7 trillion won) year-on-year, and local tax revenues also rose 6.3 percent (4.5 trillion won).Korea`s national burden rate is still very low among OECD members. As of last year, Mexico (17.2 percent), Chile (20.4 percent), Ireland (23 percent), Turkey (25.5 percent), and the United States (26 percent) were the only countries with a lower national burden. The U.S. was higher than Korea in 2015 with 26.2 percent, but turned over. Denmark's national burden was highest among OECD countries with 45.9 percent last year, followed by France (45.3 percent), Belgium (44.2 percent), Finland (44.1 percent), and Sweden (44.1 percent). Korea is 8 percent lower than the OECD average of 34.3 percent. The problem is speed. The national burden rate jumped to 26.3 percent in 2016 from 23.6 percent in 2006, a 10-year jump of 2.7 percent. Meanwhile, the OECD average rose only by 0.7 percentage points to 34.3 percent from 33.6 percent during the same period. The nation's government is still collecting less and spending less, but it is sharply more than its OECD counterparts.[Table] % of national burden rate of OECD major countries during the last five years ※ Data source : For the OECD, the Korean national burden rate is expected to continue to rise. This year, the tax burden is expected to rise as the tax boom has continued and the tax rates of conglomerates and those who are eligible for the highest income bracket are confirmed early next year. The rapid increase in financial demand due to the introduction of child benefits and an increase in basic pension is also expected to lead to a rise in the national burden rate. Another reason is the rising national burden is the possibility that health insurance premiums rise as a result of expanding benefits coverage. Some say that the national pension premium rate will be raised. Experts say that even with strong spending restructuring, it is not easy to slow the rise in the national burden if the aging population with low fertility rates and the decreased number of people who can be produced are considered. Economic tax professor Ahn Chang-nam at Kangnam University said, We should first determine where our welfare level will be based, and determine the level of the tax burden or the level of the burden we should shoulder. Even if we set our goals and raise the national burden to meet the welfare standards, our finances should not be negative, Ahn stressed. pdhis959@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"▽ Game players who went through the market as a roundabout listing and game publishers are still in the red.Some companies that have secured competitive intellectual property rights (IP) and game line-up have significant results, but most of them have not made it to the main stage.According to the Financial Supervisory Service on July 10, A-Leagn H&G lost 400 million won in the third quarter of this year, and the deficit continued. The cumulative loss to the third quarter of this year is 1.9 billion won. The predecessor of Afro-Rosen H&G ; was Lokojoy, a Korean subsidiary of Chinese game company RokozoI.Lokojoy, famous for its popular mobile game, Master Tanker, entered the local stock market in May 2015, acquiring junior Kosdaq retailer Innerstek. However, the business in South Korea has not been completed yet. Dragon-Raja, released last February, is the only popular game. Last November, China's Rokozov Company turned its shares in Rokozoy to bio-enterprise Afro-Jones after only one and a half years in Korea. Companies that have switched to APRON H&G ; earlier this year are currently in the forefront of the bio-medicine business, although they maintain their game business. As of the third quarter, mobile game sales amounted to 370 million won, or 4.4 percent of the total.Another Chinese game company, the Shins Times, also performed poorly. The newspaper bought Cowon System, famous for MP3 last January, and sold it off the market.Although the company`s operating profit in the third quarter of this year was 520 million won, it is still in the red as of this year's accumulated. No new film has made any noticeable achievements since the release of Korea`s first film, Battle 1942.The situation at Ein High is worse. The controversy over the rival companies, which erupted last year, ended but was later postponed due to the effects of the results. Currently, the largest shareholder is Hong Kong Fame Champion Trading, a 100-percent subsidiary of Chinese game company Kingnet.AmhiI was selected for a list-qualification qualification review in September after it was confirmed that sales in the second quarter of this year were less than 300 million won. The company has submitted its improvement plan and the stock trading has been suspended until after the improvement period ends on Oct. 31, next year and whether or not to de-listing is decided.Longtoo Corriedo is not in a comfortable situation. Last year, Long-Tue Korea performed "" Sword and Magic "" and "" Hot Peafowl Steel for Kakao "" one after another in Korea. Particularly, the hit movie, Hot Peasant for Kakao, debuted last October at Google Play, just behind the Lineage Brothers, and climbed to third in sales.The heat and heat of the lake helped revive the mood, but performance remains sluggish. This year, sales of existing games decreased, and with the exception of Yeonghwanggang, there were no new hits. The operating loss in the third quarter was 113 million won, switching the deficit from a year earlier.The company expects to improve performance starting in the fourth quarter, which reflects Korea`s hot and strong performances. The hot spring lake last month reportedly generated 10 billion won in sales in the first month of its release. As the Chinese games advanced more rapidly this year, the ` sseup sseul ` has become popular among Chinese game companies during the past two or three years, by going to Korea through a roundabout listing. He stepped on Korean soil without difficulty by taking over the management control of merchants who were mostly in poor financial structures or business conditions. In April 2015, Longtoo Coreia bought Inett School, the head of the KOSDAQ, and ended its start."" The Chinese game market is also very polarized with big and small companies just like Korea, "" said an official at a Chinese game agency, adding, "" As large Korean companies such as Tensent have a strong monopoly in entering the global market, the rest of them are turning their eyes to being bridge-loaders. ""However, it is difficult to determine whether the companies will be able to stay in the league based on their performances so far. Industry sources point to a lack of game line-up, poor management skills, and management disputes. In particular, the Chinese game makers have been bitter, as they have recently shown positive results in the domestic mobile game market, including Girls ` Front, collapsing into third.Regardless of whether or not the company is listed, there have been many Chinese-made mobile games that have successfully targeted Korean users this year, industry watchers point out.

"Among the 95 civilian boat rescue teams that can not move out of the DMZ, the National Assembly can organize 58 rescue boats out of the total 95 allocated to land use by the 1.2-ton mini-coast Coast Guard Post Police Box and the National Maritime Police Box to manage 202 carrier…Intentiation structures on the National Assembly As darkness fell, streetlights and lighthouse lights were brightly lit along the breakwater. The Coast Guard's adjustment of the coast guard at Mohang Port in Taean-gun, South Chungcheong Province. Inside the breakwater, a small boat was hanging in a blue plastic apron. Taean Coast Guard's Mohang Police Box is currently operating in Jung-dong, Seoul. It is 1.2 tons and has 3 passengers on board. It is the only means of transportation to be dispatched by the parent port police in the event of an accident at sea, such as a shipwreck or wreck. When waves over 1.5 meters are heard, it is difficult to operate outside the breakwater. The boat was so small that it could be overturned by the waves. Searchlight and light beam are the only equipment installed for this rescue. Because there are no radar or night navigation equipment, they can not get reported to the sea before sunrise and during fog. In the event of an accident, one should reach out to the civilian Marine Rescue Unit, which is registered at Mohang Police Box. Coast Guard's adjustment of the coast guard at Mohang Port in Taean-gun, Chungnam Province (The civil sea rescue team can not get to the sea due to the lack of night navigation equipment with a 2.2-ton floating garden). So, when the reporters ` situation is like this, the three-shift crew should check who to ask of the rescue team to come in today. 25 private maritime rescue teams are registered at Mohang Police Box. About three of the ships are selected and requested to provide support on a daily basis. There are as many as 202 ships registered at Mohang Police Box. The coast structure of the Maritime Police Agency, which oversees the ships, is a 1.2-ton miniboat. The Coast Guard's Coast Guard's adjustment unit and a 1.2-ton miniboat of three crewmembers in Taean County, South Chungcheong Province, can not get to the station if the sun shines. "" Even though the employees wanted to move out at the risk of their lives, we still needed to add more personnel 24 hours, "" said Shin Chin-ho, a 58-year-old police chief. Things are worse at Ansan Police Box for Pyeongtaek Maritime Police Station. Ansan Police Box has a 3-ton intervention along the coast. The ship is because of a system that must be out 24 hours a day, 365 days a year should always be floating on the sea. Maritime police are on report for the police. Since there is no anchorage at Ansan Police Box, they will take a rubber boat to row out and ride to the riverside. However, the mudflat often appears in Daebuheo-do, Ansan City, where the Ansan Police Box is located, due to the difference in tide. As a result, the coast guard will be anchored about 50 meters away from the harbor. When the police report is received, Ansan police officers ride a patrol car from the police box, move 500 meters, and carry the rubber boat they keep in the upper deck of the pier, and run to the sea. It is 150 meters away from carrying a raft on a cart. Coast Guard officials are riding a rubber boat to go to the coastal town of Jeong-dong in Gobak. Since there is no anchorage at Ansan Police Box, they will take a rubber boat to row out and ride to the riverside. [Photo, Maritime Police Agency] That does not mean it can be immediately moved. After both on board the boat rowed after the sea coast, adjustments up to 50 can be more not to the scene of the movement, the m. It takes more than 15 minutes during regular training. Additional 5-10 minutes are needed for night or strong winds. If the wind is strong, the boat can not go out even though you row 50 meters. In addition, the 3-ton offshore structure owned by Ansan Police Station is an old boat that has been built for 18 years. The shelf life has been exceeded three years. Since there is no structural steel to replace, the only way to move is with a rowboat when it is repaired. The ship is in control of 44 ships. Coast Guard officials are riding a rubber boat to go to the coastal town of Jeong-dong in Gobak. Since there is no anchorage at Ansan Police Box, they will take a rubber boat to row out and ride to the riverside. Ansan Police Station Chief Kim Hee-jung (58) said, I felt sorry that even when Yeongheungdo Fishing boats were involved in the accident, I could not afford to leave the coast area and go to and from the sea. The reality is that 95 Coast Guard police stations across the nation are virtually impossible to get to unless private rescue teams are present, such as the Mohang Police Box or Ansan Police Box. Up to 236 business establishments are worse. The Korea Coast Guard's current address was confirmed by the JoongAng Ilbo after the accident on the Youngheungdo Island fishing boat on July 3. The port of Banghae Port, Daebudo Island, Ansan City, Gyeonggi Province, is often exposed to mudflat because of the difference in tide and tide. As a result, the coast guard will be anchored about 50 meters away from the harbor. According to the Korea Coast Guard, only 58 coast structures were allowed to be moved at night regardless of weather conditions during the adjustment process at 95 Coast Guard Police headquarters nationwide. Some 37 places have an area near the coast that can not be moved, such as Mohang Police Box. Among the 236 stations, only 16 have rescue boats, less than one tenth of them. Because of this, the scene complained that the second Yeongheung Island incident could recur unless the equipment was properly installed. The Coast Guard's budget for next year is 1.2718 trillion won, up 5.1 percent from this year's. However, the budget for strengthening search and rescue was cut by 58 percent to 5.5 billion won from 13.5 billion won this year. The budget for offshore rescue equipment was also decreased by 21.5 percent from 19.14 billion won to 13.5 billion won. The rescue team's new boat purchase budget, which reflects 6.1 billion won this year, will be exempt from next year's budget. If we receive a call for an adjustment to the Coast Guard's headquarters in the event of an rollover on fishing equipment near Yeongheungdo Island on July 3, the Maritime Police Department said yesterday, [Yonhap news agency] said Kim Kil-soo, who was in charge of maritime transportation at the Maritime Affairs and Maritime Affairs and Transportation Agency. It is also necessary to secure mooring facilities, which allow the coast area to be adjusted and rescue boats to be carried out 24 hours a day. Because of the fact that the arrival time of fishing boats from Yeongheungdo Island and its moorings can be delayed as a result of the accident. The Coast Guard, which arrived at the scene of the accident, arrived 37 minutes after the accident due to mediation by the coast guard at Yeongheungdo Police Box. The rescue boat was anchored at a private moorings, where it took 13 minutes for the ships to be dislodged. At the breakwater entrance, where the adjustment of the coast area of the Korea Coast Guard's Ansan Police Box was anchored, large-scale iron doors were installed to keep the public in and out. The Korea Coast Guard, which received a report, needs to unlock the iron gate before it can be moved to the rubber boat storage area. Of the 95 Coast Guard Police, only 23 have private berths to use. Another third of the respondents said, "" We will have to pay more than half of the total of those spots next year. As a result, experts point out that the most urgent task is to secure a special outpost with the cooperation of the Maritime Ministry and local governments. Because of the difference between the tide and the tide, the West Coast is often caused by the fact that ships could get caught on mud flats unless a special moorings are built. Maritime police said, "" We apply for a budget to secure a private moorings, but it is not reflected immediately. "" Maritime police say most of the berths are owned by the government or local governments, but it is not easy to cooperate. Maritime police are on report for the police. Since there is no anchorage at Ansan Police Box, they will take a rubber boat to row out and ride to the riverside. For new boats operated by the rescue team, it is also an urgent task to secure additional boats for emergencies. As shown in the Youngheungdo accident, the Incheon rescue team and other old boats are not allowed to operate at night. There are three rescue teams belonging to the Korea Coast Guard and 32 rescue boats assigned to rescue teams belonging to 19 police stations nationwide. Out of these, only 14 new models are new, less than half. Six more ships are scheduled to be available by the end of the year, but when the repairs are carried out with the malfunction and routine maintenance, there is likely to be no new boat to replace, leading to a second Incheon rescue team crisis. Maritime rescue team has a medium to long boat. It is 2.5 tons long and lacks radar equipment, so it is very dangerous to travel by night. Incheon rescue team was told to leave for the accident on August 3, but could not get to shore because a new boat was being repaired. As we have been adding equipment and manpower to the crackdown on Chinese fishing boats in recent years, we need to have more fish fishermen and other equipment along the coast, said a senior Coast Guard official. Maritime police plan to operate a station police station to deploy additional rescue personnel, taking into consideration the distance between rescue teams and police stations. The station police station decided to pick a police station that is far from the rescue team and has frequent accidents. It also plans to provide more equipment, more manpower, secure moorings, and enhance education and training. A new boat owned by the Coast Guard's rescue team, equipped with a 7.5 ton radar, is available 24 hours a day. Of 32 rescue boats deployed in three special rescue teams and 19 rescue teams, only 14 are new.[Photo, Maritime and Police Agency] Rep.

Since it is a rule not to move the crane during the lifting process, if the statement is found to be true, the accident could be due to operational error, according to analysis. Police in eastern Gyeonggi Province announced yesterday that they will investigate the accident of a tower crane in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, which killed three people. Photograph of a policeman watching the scene. [Yonhap news] According to the Employment and Labor Ministry and police investigating the accident on July 10, investigators "" saw a tower crane trolley move before the accident "" from witnesses. The trolley adjusts the location of hooks to move construction material to a device on a street jeep that serves as Tower Crane's arm. If the crane raises, the trolley shall be adjusted to center of gravity to fix the hooks in the proper position on the main jeep. If the trolley moves during the weight lifting process, it may suddenly change its weight, causing the crane to lose its balance and fall. Regarding this statement, one tower crane expert stated, "" It is very dangerous to move a crane during an impression. "" "" If the trolley moved, it would have been easy for the crane operator to make an impression by mistake, "" adding, "" If so, why not? "" Tower Crane, bent and fallen. [Yonhap news agency] Police said, "" We can't confirm the status of the investigation to the initial stages of the investigation, "" and the Employment and Labor Ministry said, "" If that's true, then why the trolley is going to face it. Investigators will also determine whether the trolley's movement could cause direct accidents through joint on-site inspections. Meanwhile, the crane operator was seriously injured and hospitalized, and investigation of the crane is expected to take time. Park Sang-wook, reporter of park.lepremier.joongang.co.craft.crosoft. The central newspaper [Facebook] [Facebook] [Go Global Tax Center] [Movile Plus when it comes to paying taxes in the mobile]. However, it is still unclear when the tax will be imposed and how it will be done when. Even within the government, disputes over the imposition of virtual currency is due to the parallel lines.The National Tax Service said, "" We need to impose heavier taxes on those who earn profits from trading on virtual currency or when raising business income from repeated transactions. "" This means that they will collect capital gains tax and corporate tax. Of course, the fund provided a premise that it treats virtual money as an asset such as real estate or stock. However, some view that they deny the premise. When taxes are collected, the government recognizes virtual currency as an asset, which results in a more favorable transaction, which results in a more widespread Bitcone frenzy. The enforcement of the tax is the legalization of virtual currency, and the only answer is the legalization of the ban on transactions. The Ministry of Justice maintains this view. Overseas, China and Russia completely banned virtual currency transactions, while the United States, Japan, and Britain have taken control of the currency market and have to pay taxes. Issues remain over how to assess taxes. First of all, there is the question of whether to levy taxes on financial instruments. An official at the ministry said, "" If you look at virtual money as a financial commodity, you can apply a flexible tax rate like a derivative with a lower tax rate, but if you do not recognize it as a financial asset, you must recognize it as the same as the top asset as a real estate asset. "" When it comes to financial products, it will be possible to trade with the U.S. as a bit-coined gift. Some argue that the U.S. should be regarded as a financial product, but the Korean government has so far kept its stance that it is not a financial product. The rule of free trade is not easy when it comes to imposing VAT beyond transfer and income taxes. If you consider virtual currency as a commodity, you can impose a surcharge on it, but if you accept the nature of the payment method, you are entitled to a tax-free. Advanced countries have long debated whether or not to recognize the monetary nature of virtual currencies, however, more non-taxable countries are on the rise recently. When tax is enforced, it is also important to build infrastructure to facilitate it. As it is not clear who trades virtual currency now, it is difficult to assess the tax base even when a tax policy is set. To improve this, it is necessary to have the exchange submit mandatory data. However, the question of whether to impose a tax on virtual currency is not finished yet, so the discussion is slow.Seominjun reporter, Seo Min-jun, morandol@sedaily.com[ Go straight to the Seoul Economy.
