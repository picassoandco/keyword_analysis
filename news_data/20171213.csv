Choi is in court "" before the president and not in fact publicly. I don't know anything, ' he said, but the disclosure is likely to put me at a disadvantage.Choi in the trial conducted (Seyoon Kim was a judge) of 22 criminal court in Seoul on 13 between prosecution before the president and former presidential protocol secretary, Choi, and jeonghoseong.Playing in court recorded conversation between a file. The file was burned as a compact disk by prosecutors and was submitted to the court.According to the transcript upon taking office after the election before the president on 17 February 2013, ahead of the president at the time of and met Choi, the former secretary. Former president said Park here trying to do on the new government is largely divided into two groups. One is welfare. Economic growth through the creative economy is one.They are before the president was discussing a topic to be in his inaugural address. Choi here ""have good words of economic revival."" Park said the former president said ""economic revival and national happiness"". Choi responded, I think happiness is good for the people.Choi is before the president is 'welfare' 'creative economy' 'peace building trust on the Korean peninsula' for referring to national basis and put in the culture there, too.Can drop me off all those things, embassies and diplomatic missions and be formed ""and"" it is this have to appear in his inaugural address, stressed.

It was at a time when the National Intelligence Service and the military were in dispute over their involvement in the presidential election last year. In early November 2013, the president, is scheduled ahead of his seven-day trip to Europe, such as the National Intelligence Service's intervention in the presidential debate about the situation did not come up with nothing.The situation for Choi, the former secretary "" Vice, senior U.S. military base and the new minister to do so words and people wanted just (former president is Park) I'm going to go.It seems not to go "" Before the president is a messy political situation than going out during overseas trips and I left some say in the form of 'words' or via the Cabinet meeting through the seat that can beThat he had instructed the former secretary to come up.

That ipttanneun, so domestic, you (former president is Park) don't have to have this conversation whether or not, her thanks to Mr. Choi said.As of October 30, 2013, followed by conversation transcript of the deliveries, the day after the Park during the president has to be addressed by the Choi by instructions containing. It was right after then Prime Minister Chung Hong-won announced public suspicions about his comment. Choi said, It is hard to say the same thing again because I spoke all the time as Chung Hong-won, I must, therefore, ask Chung to do it because it is important.Choi is also about the president of external events involved situation appeared.

What you see next door is a free comic strip and a gift batter! ▶ A writer of "" Real Time News, "" and a non-trading and redistribution-redistribution of "" Money, "" published by cheerleader vs. Among Japan's top three carriers, Yamato Corp., and Gyu-bin, the second largest, have raised their tax hikes, and are net sellers for post offices, with no increase in prices. However, the ' Post Office Delivery Service ' is also scheduled to raise prices starting next March. Even before the increase, Japan's delivery fee was very steep compared to Korea's. The cost of sending a parcel from Tokyo to Sapporo (total box size, width, height, and one meter) was 1620 yen. It has been raised to 1,728 yen since October. It is an impression I have made in 17 years. Although the rates vary by distance, each small parcel is approximately 13,000 to 25,000 won.The main reason why parcel service providers raised prices is due to a "" shortage of delivery personnel. "" This is especially true when the holidays are full of sales and gifts. Due to a shortage of hands, it is not easy to find a courier even at the hourly rate of 2,000 yen (20,000 won). As for Yamato, due to lack of manpower due to increased choice, management and labor agreed to increase the amount of money to hire more employees. In addition, the company removed the "" 12 p.m. - 2 p.m. "" section during the allotted time of delivery services so that the courier can easily get lunch break. In addition, the postal authorities will have to increase the number of managers so that the courier can check the hours of work accurately and leave the office at a certain time.Japanese credit card company Credit Sezon Corp. in September assigned all 2200 non-regular workers, or 55 percent of its 4100 former employees, to work full-time. The company had two "" union jobs "" : regular employees and three "" non-regular workers, "" who were called "" particularians "" and "" roommates, "" all became full-time. The president of the company, Morino, directed the reorganization of the personnel system in a four-day package of changes, allowing employees to unite to join in changes, not just modify projects to improve profits from job changes.One woman, who was a non-regular worker, interviewed the media with a smile, "" I have been paid hourly wage, and I am motivated to be a monthly wage and salary employee. "" Reforming the conservative system while leaving temporary employees behind is not a reform option, said the company`s personnel manager. The company believes that the rate of labor increase by increasing by 4 % by turning everyone into full-time workers. If profits grow to more than that, this could be an investment for growth.By 2030, one third of the population will be over the age of 65. Businesses face the fact that the business resource of being a human is not limitless. Providing a more favorable working environment while keeping a serious face on people will determine the competitiveness of a shrinking society.It is no longer a news story that college graduates or high school graduates in Japan are choosing jobs. Companies are becoming the world to yell at the job seekers to come to our company without changing their minds. In Japan, aging and falling young people are big problems in society, but sometimes the merits of an age when the population is decreasing are explained.One poll showed that 1. Improve unemployment. 3. Reduce competition for entrance exams. Increase in affluence and time. Of course, it is a precondition that the economy continues to grow. In Japan, where the postwar boom generation of the Dankai generation, born between 1947 and 49, has left society and entered an era of declining populations, the value of ' human, ' or ' labor, ' has returned earlier to us.It was 15 years ago in South Korea when more than one million babies were born each year before the 1970s. Now the birth age of 300,000 children a year is upon us. The reality is that parents can not afford even one child's private education, but are they optimistic that 400,000 and 300,000 children will be able to pick and go to work later? When can Korea end the "" surplus human age "" and get human labor again?

According to fire department officials on July 13, a female high school student lost consciousness on bus 172 a.m., which was passing by Sunggok Elementary School in northern Seoul at 8:30 a.m. The student was reportedly standing in the middle of the bus when he suddenly fell down.Lee Hyo-seok, a reporter at a private high school who collapsed on a packed bus : "" People in Seoul fell asleep safely due to the sudden loss of consciousness on bus No.172 near Sunggok High School.

The bus was packed to work. However, citizens agreed to make room for the girls by giving each other a little. As the driver stopped the car at the side of the road, 50, a security manager, Jeong Tae-seon, who knew how to do first aid, performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation for a schoolgirl. Fortunately, the student was breathing when he tried to get a prayer as he had been educated at the fire department and then made two chest compressions, Jung told Yonhap news, "" When a schoolgirl said, ' Why did I fall down? ' and stood up because it looked okay, the other citizens in the seat immediately gave up their seat, "" he said. Chung added, It was good to see passengers cooperate with the first aid, as if they worried about their daughter or sister, rather than complained or complained even though the bus stopped quite a bit during rush hour.

By category, the closer you are to Grade 1 or Grade 1, the fewer deaths or accidents occur. It can also be seen as a relatively safer place than other regions within the same unit by city, town, or county. Based on the disclosed results, Dalseong-gun in Daegu received one grade in six categories. Only criminal sectors remained in the fourth rank, making them the safest local government in the nation. Seoul Yangcheon-gu, Busan Gijang-gun, Ulju-gun, Gyeonggi Gunpo, Uiwang, and Gyeryong-si were also ranked first in five categories.

At that time, winter rain and snow were also seen in Helsinki. Both buses and tram cars were designed to be at a low point, so it was not inconvenient to ride in and out with a stroller. People with disabilities in wheelchairs could not experience much inconvenience in using public transportation.Furthermore, since passengers with babies in strollers were not charged, Helsinki simply deserved to be called ' heaven of traffic underdogs.

"[Asian economy reporter Lee Ji-eun] The government on July 13 requested the Korea Exchange to prepare measures to protect investors by preventing foreign investors from trading with minors due to overheated virtual currency transactions. The government should consider tax policies while preventing the financial institutions from investing in virtual currencies. The government held a vice ministerial meeting with Hong Nam-gi, chief of the Office for Government Policy Coordination, and prepared measures to deal with the virtual currency government. The Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), with cooperation from banks, decided to open an account and prohibit foreign students under the age of high school students from trading. In addition, the bank will have banks identify the users themselves during the transaction payment process and manage their withdrawals from their own accounts. To prevent new investments in virtual currencies by institutional financial institutions from provoking speculative sentiment, financial institutions were also prohibited from holding, purchasing, obtaining collateral or investing in equity.In addition, the ministry will ensure that virtual currency transactions can not take place without the requirement to protect investors and secure transparency through the use of a legal system. In the future, the management of virtual currency exchange will be required to separately deposit customer assets, fulfill the obligation of explanation, verify the user's real names, distribute secret keys, and disclose the purchase price and order of the virtual currency. In relation to this, it imposes a duty on the virtual currency exchange to prevent money laundering and increases the duty of banks to report suspicious transactions. Activities that are prohibited by the virtual currency exchange, such as the International Monetary Fund (ICO) or granting of credit, are also clearly defined and punished in the event of violation. Tax collectors and related organizations will form a task force and refer to cases of major countries for further consideration. The penalties for virtual call-related crimes will be stronger. The prosecution and police cracked down strictly on virtual-calls-related crimes such as the raising of virtual currency investment funds in multI-stage, selling virtual currency based on expectations, illicit transactions using virtual currency, and hiding criminal gains from virtual currencies. In case of ongoing hacking into the Bitcone Exchange, the virtual currency ' Yiduo ' scandal, and the investigation into the new currency scandal involving Bitcone using the Incheon District Public Prosecutors ' Office, the investigation into the case is proceeding. It also carried out a investigation into the actual exchange of money in violation of the Foreign Exchange Trade Act and also promoted joint inspections by related agencies if necessary. To prevent the withdrawal of virtual currency purchasing funds under the guise of overseas travel expenses, the government will also strengthen management of removing expensive overseas travel sites. Accordingly, whistleblowers of overseas travel expenses are required to submit their pre-use plans. The ministry will investigate the leakage of personal information from the virtual currency exchange and check the structure of the virtual currency transaction and take stern measures to detect any violation. The FTC is currently reviewing the terms of the four major virtual currency exchanges, and it will investigate the unfairness of the remaining ones simultaneously. The exchange is regularly inspected to prevent hacking or personal information leakage, and applied sanctions when there is a violation of the Information and Communications Network Act. Also, for businesses who violate the law while leaking personal information, a temporary service suspension system is adopted, and the standard for imposing fines for personal information leakage is raised. In this regard, the exchange, which has more than 10 billion won in sales and has more than one million visitors per day, will have to certify its Information Protection Management System (ISMS) from next year. The government will continue to hold vice ministerial meetings and related ministries ' TF at regular intervals under the supervision of the Presidential Secretary for Government Policy Coordination to closely observe the trends in virtual currency transactions and push ahead with necessary system improvements. The TF also regularly warns of the dangers of investments in virtual currencies, such as losses due to changes in values, fraud and hacking risks. However, the government will make up for the side effects of speculative investment in virtual currencies but will not prevent the development of technologies such as block chains. The government said, "" The block chain is not only used in virtual currencies but is a general purpose technology that can be applied in a wide range of industries, "" adding, "" We will support and foster domestic technology development and industrial promotion.

"Click the image in Kookmin Ilbo website Click here to view college early 2010, ‘the shadow of distrust’ as students at educational authorities after the operation of measures in Incheon.Private teacher was supportive of each year to fix the students milling characteristics evaluation of half-baked restructuring if it discharges the Ministry of Education that it's hard for anxious parents caught on private education.Moon Jae-in, the government is on the notice this time of the cycle of counter-revenge, of university professors at least one child, famous kkeunheojilkka his been in as a co-author of the paper.Readers on (Kookmin Ilbo on December 8 see front page, etc.) behavior for educational background of inheritance ; of cases of attempted. The Education Ministry has grown distrustful of those who are questioned by filling prescriptions. That is why the comprehensive admission process of the school administration is branded as a gold spoon and chopsticks. The ministry has quickly launched an investigation and predicted improvements in the system regarding the insertion of the author into the paper, but many are skeptical whether it will make any changes in the system. Will the violation of university admission rules be eliminated? ▽ History of foul = The current university entrance examination is divided into the regular recruitment of school records and regular recruitment of college entrance exams. As the percentage of students who take part in the program increases rapidly, the importance of students is growing. Therefore, violations have mostly been carried out by manipulating the school ministry. Sometimes asked for money from wealthy parents, and sometimes made unauthorised contact the ministry to improve academic performance. The classroom teacher, the subject teacher, and the school manager were all controlled. Education authorities had said they would suggest boosting the reliability of the students ' departments with the Incheon incident. However, last year, another large-scale manipulation happened at a girls ' high school in Gwangju. A private high school in Gyeonggi Province recently discovered a teacher who illegally changed her daughter's student department to fit for college admission. The teacher's teaching at her daughter's school stirred controversy. According to the National Assembly audit report submitted to the Education, Culture, Sports and Tourism Committee, the same schools for teachers ` parents and their children worked and attended the same schools as schools nationwide, with 560 schools having parents. That is 24 percent of the total high school. The student's department is written by a co-worker of his parents. Such a thing has happened many times and it could happen in the future is gaining the logic and power of those who insist on reducing the number of academic classes. The bigger problem is that such violations are not entirely possible. If the ministry is directly involved in the fabrication, detection and punishment may be possible. However, if the results are carried out in secret, it is difficult to find evidence as bribes are not exchanged, and most of all, it is hard to find connections with university admission. It is also due to the nature of qualitative assessments to score the subjective evaluation of evaluators. Meanwhile, private institutions are likely to constantly produce new college admission standards for the wealthy. As the application specifications are all the rage, wealthy people are using the system and the Ministry of Education is banning them. Private education firms have also covered students with small company CEOs and made them into promising patented inventors and boy writers who won the contest. One of the specifications that private institutions are paying attention to these days is the online public disclosure class. The government is also partnering with other major universities in the country to provide K-Muk services, which are already estimated to have more than 30,000 middle and high school students. A private education consulting firm in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, said, It is not possible to create university admission specifications in a hurry and pay large sums of money. The program is operated as a membership system from the tenth grade and provides monthly payments of 250,000 to 300,000 won and a package of university admission specifications is administered, including writing the Ka-Muk. The small gate activity once belonged to some specialized high schools or autonomous private high schools, but it is now widely distributed to general high schools. Many private education companies expect Ka-Muk to follow suit. Reforms : It is none other than the political and educational authorities that provide the basis for the vicious cycle of private education violations. The situation is not going to turn out of a vicious circle. It is about this way. Politicians and education authorities are unprepared for school, but suddenly they fix the college entrance system. Increased uncertainty in the university entrance exams makes parents and students nervous and seek private institutes. When private education costs increase and the suffering of parents and students increases, the political circle tries to solve them again, saying, "" This is a premature reform. "" The "" feedback "" structure is constantly repeating itself at high schools. Violators such as fabrication of the student ministry and inclusion of authors in the thesis are also allowed on this basis. Education authorities have been pushing for policies by continuously reducing the influence of the CSAT and increasing the student-oriented screening process. The reason for the increase in the portion of the student-oriented admission process was the normalization of high school education. The problem is speed. The percentage of students who did not participate in the program increased from 56.7 percent in the 2009 school year to 73.7 percent in the 2018 school year. On the other hand, the time was 43.3 percent to 26.3 percent, nearly a decade away. The tendency is to see higher rates at more preferred universities, but the rates of students in the 10 major universities in Seoul jumped from 67.9 percent in 2016 to 74 percent in 2018. Universities as well as schools could hardly adapt to such drastic changes. The chief directors of the school's 60 universities also reviewed documents on applicants, most of whom were 260. As a flighty review is carried out, combats and penalties are prevalent. Students can gradually choose to study on their own, have more control over their college entrance, and have more room for private tutoring. In the U.S., where the admission officer system has established, admissions officers often look into students ' personalities and development possibilities while forming trust with high school teachers, just as they do with athletes. Korean academic community was not equipped with the trust of high school and university, neither university nor students, nor teachers, but the political and educational authorities hurriedly pushed for it. As a result, many people point out that problems are happening everywhere. Moon Jae-in a state government a ‘the class’ plan. As the college entrance exam and high school grades were changed to absolute assessment, the school field is closely watching closely. The revision is scheduled to be unveiled in June next year and is scheduled to be announced in August. The first experiment to revamp the university system is currently in confusion. In addition, Moon Jae-in, the government also began a trial like college, who runs a high school high school credit system. These policies are being pushed ahead with the education system and with sufficient deliberation. Will Moon Jae-in, the government to stop a vicious circle can?yido@kmib.co.kr, Graphics = Ahn [Kookmin Daily Web site] [Facebook] [Reporting Center Whisper!

"CBS Kim Hyun-jung's News Show - ' Jet Flow is Going to Be Depressed - 35 ° Cold Now, stay over the Korean Peninsula - ' The Seven Sweep-Up Souns on Radio ' ■ Media Center The weather is news. ' The weather is news again this morning. It's really biting cold. It's minus 12 in Seoul this morning. Cheorwon dropped to minus 18. We've had a cold snap warning in most parts of the country. In particular, a cold wave warning has been raised in the northern part of Gyeong-pyeong, North Gyeongsang Province. Of course, winter is cold. But even considering the cold, Dongjae-gun is very active right now because it is not even close to the cold of recent times. Let's have a quick forecast of why and how long it will last for this winter. Catawarder anti-predication center manager is connected. Hi, Hanseong Center. Hello, half star ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Why is it so cold? This winter has come very quickly But the biggest reason is, I don't know, the strong cold is coming down, because the first is the cold in the Arctic. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : Did the cold at the North Pole get here? It is very unusual for a cold of - 30 degrees in the air, but it is also very rare for a - 30 degree Celsius mark to fall in December. And this cold came down, and northeast of our country, so we now have this upper-level cyclone near the border between Russia and Manchuria. What this is called is a blocking cyclone, and it prevents high pressure from traveling eastward. As a result, the cold air from the north continues to flow into our country and strengthen it. It brings the cold to Korea. Because the cold high pressure is constantly in place, it's cold. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > But why did the cold at the North Pole, minus 35 degree Celsius, come down like this,? If you think about it, it's the polar vortex that we call one of the effects of anti-Chinese > global warming. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : What is it? We say it is a whirlpool rotating around a pole, and it is a very strong cold. It is usually the jet stream that serves to stop the cold at the North Pole in winter. The problem is, when the temperature is low in the North Pole, the temperature difference between the North Pole and the middle - and middle-latitude increases, and the jet stream exercises very strongly. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Dongseo. (Photo : Data photo) It prevents the half-year > Arctic chills from falling, and this jet stream is responsible for it. But the Arctic temperature difference with the mid - to mid - latitudes may be relatively reduced as the temperature rises due to climate change. As the jet stream, which prevents the cold from the North Pole, weakens, so it exercises more for the South and North rather than for the West. They do exercises to the south. As the Arctic cold is extended south, it's going to be very cold or cold. So even though the temperature at the North Pole has become warmer by climate change, it's pretty cold for the mid - latitudes. However high it is, it is a relative concept. And the cold at the North Pole falls almost to 20 degrees below zero, along the jet stream. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I understand a little now. So I've got a lot of temperature rises due to global warming, and I don't really understand why it's getting colder in winter, but when I heard it, it's really cold. However, the bigger the difference between the North Pole and the mid - latitudes the more actively the jet stream to block it, as it paced back and forth. This part of it weakens, so you don't do what you did to stop it. ^ Half-seminarity > Yes. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > So even though it gets cooler in winter, many people say that the Earth is getting warmer. But why is it colder in winter? That's why we call it the paradox of global warming. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > paradox of global warming. ♫ Half-sensitive > In fact, the most serious kind of weather phenomenon caused by global warming is rising temperatures. I mean, these days, the heat wave is still on, isn't it? ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Dae Frica and we sang Daegu last summer because it was so hot. Mr Half-section : Yes. Now, the reason it's colder than usual in winter is because of the increase in temperature due to global warming, and in the end, it's called ◇ Kim Hyun-jung. Then, you should anticipate this cold spell and this winter's weather. When will you be able to release it first? (Photo : Data photo) ◆ bangi . > > I think the strong cold now is going to be temporarily relieved by Saturday. But again on the 18th and 19th, a cold snap, and then it goes by, and now it looks like it's going to get a little over the year's worth of temperatures around Christmas before another cold snap starts in late December. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Director of Center, please wait a minute. Since old times, when it is cold in winter, we do it in Korea. If it is three days cold, does the three conditions collapse when the four days should be clear and this cold spell started last Friday and the cold still shows no sign of abating and the three days of cold? As a matter of fact, one of the winter weather phenomena that comes down to Korea is Samhansaon. I haven't seen such a regular cold recently. So we call it the classic weather phenomenon, and the reason is that all of these weather patterns have changed recently due to the effects of global warming. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > also global warming. ♫ So, the warm cycle of the cold on the sunny side changes very irregular. This year's weather was also cold since November, for example, it was still cooler than usual for 13 days before it was warm for two days. And this is thirteen times two on. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > 13, 2-on-and-a-half nature > Will it not be easy to see the periodic weather of the three cold weather conditions from now on? ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > We used to memorize things like the trihounseon and take tests in the winter in our textbooks, but there is no point anymore. I should also drop out of my textbooks. It is almost never shown, now. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Let me make a general forecast for this winter. Last summer was hotter than ever before. It is almost 40 degrees. Then should I expect so much this winter? It is predicted that it will be winter when it is cold than usual. First of all, we have a Ranigna phenomenon in progress. The Raninya phenomenon is a form in which the temperature of eastern Pyongyang is lower than usual, but once it goes on in a weaker form this winter, it is expected to happen and we usually have such a tendency to freeze in the winter. Of course, it's very cold this December, which is currently three degrees below average. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > too cold. If the average temperature is 3 degrees, it is very cold. It's almost three to six degrees below zero last year, which is probably about three to six degrees below the previous year, although the average temperature should be. It is extremely cold, in fact, almost the unprecedented cold of December of this year, with temperatures expected to be lower than usual in January and February. However, I do not expect it to be as severe a winter as in March, which is less than 3 degrees below average. But I think it is more likely that it will be a winter when the temperature is higher and the temperature is higher and the amplification is worse. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. As we talk, everybody gets together to get global warming, if you talk about the weather these days. We have experienced the severity of this, but the Director of the Center should try to bundle up your underwear at all - when it's cold like this - half - I wear underwear. I think it's a wise life. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : A wise life is a life and I think I should do this because I wear less heat and put on my underwear and put on the heat again. ^ Half-seminarity > Correct. I'm all for it. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Let's hear it so far. Thank you. ^ Half-sensity > Yes, thank you. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung was the head of the anti-semic center of the Carwater Meteorological Center.

"" Mayor Lee Jae-myung is one of the contenders for the local elections next year.Mayor Lee wrote on Facebook on July 13, "" I went too far, Mr. Nam Kyung-pil. "" Nam`s statement was aimed at getting social media outlets to read, I will give up the game tomorrow. Governor Nam posted the sentence on Facebook the previous afternoon without giving any background information. Some say he will not run in next year's local elections. Critics said that it was not the governor's say.Nam said on his Facebook account yesterday, I felt that for the innovative development of the nation, the capital city regulations should be eliminated and that the Seoul Metropolitan Government should give up its courage. The governor, who was in charge of creating the metropolitan area and reforming regulations in the Seoul metropolitan area, wrote a teaser at the National Assembly's forum yesterday morning.However, the contents of the book were also criticized. Mayor Lee said, "" You're giving up Kyung-gi? Let's bring Kyong-gi and Seoul together to form a metropolitan Seoul district? It was an absurd argument that runs counter to the simultaneous flow of decentralization, globalization and regionalism."" The Commodity-General Daily's Homepage green@kmib.co.kr[ [Facebook] [Reporting Center Howling! (ckling] The day, the Soyang River, located near Soyanggyo Bridge 5 under the Soyanggang River Dam, had an exotic view like that of Seolbaek's Siberian Plain. Photograms, who have been waiting for Soyanggang River's annual "" Snowflake party "" created by the winter cold that began on July 13, are busy taking their first pin merchants to camera. Soyanggang River, a tributary of the Bukhangang River, boasts fantastic winter scenery with snow florets, frost tiles, and water fog every winter. However, it was silent this time last year. Because of the lack of snow and the severe winter drought, electricity generated from the Soyanggang River dam did not produce fog. Temperature, wind, and humidity conditions must be correct, such as when the temperature is low and the humidity is high, to make a high university. In particular, the discharge of power from the dams is the key. The temperature of the Soyang River in the winter when it was opened on July 13 was 2 to 4 degrees, but the water released from the dam is around 15 degrees, so the water temperature rises and the fog rises. As the cold snap is expected to reach minus 16 degrees Celsius and the water fog hits a cold branch, Sangkodae, a frost flower, suddenly forms a magnificent spectacle. Every year, the natural beauty belt becomes the new winter attraction in Chuncheon."" Last year, if I didn't like the number of high school students, I would be delighted to see them for the first time this winter, "" said Ahn Kwang-soo, director of Chuncheon Photographer's Association. hak@yna.co.kr ▶ Report and inquiry (click!) ▶ If the latest trend is collected (click!), the rank of vocational high school students in Seoul = New York University and the Education Ministry's survey on career path was conducted in 2017. hokma@newsis.com A student at a junior college chose Sejong = New Sisture&amp;Bak Young-mi and found out that 6 of the 10 college graduates were worried about their future. However, more than half of the workforce who are in charge of supporting career paths, such as running career programs at universities, have less than three years of experience in related fields and need to prepare countermeasures. Furthermore, the preference for stable jobs continued to rise due to the prolonged recession. University students with four-year educational backgrounds picked government employees and teachers as their most desired jobs, and small - and medium-sized businesses as their junior colleges. The Education Ministry and the Korea Research Institute of Vocational Education announced the results of a study on the status of the 2017 University Career Education. The survey is the first of its kind this year, which was conducted in elementary, middle and high schools. The most worrying aspect of college life for undergraduates was their four-year course of career : 60 percent, and 59.7 percent.

The survey also showed that 62.4 percent of Korean college students said they would get a job after graduation (at four-year universities and 68.4 percent at colleges), but the same percentage answered, "" I don't know yet "" (at least 22.1 percent of four-year universities. While university students ` career path is their biggest concern after graduation, 57.4 percent of those who work in career support areas have experience in the field of career support for those who have worked for them for less than three years, and 50.4 percent, respectively. The main tasks of the staff in charge of route support are the operation of career or job-related programs and counseling. The most desired employer for a four-year university was government employees and teachers (23.6 percent). Public institutions and public corporations ranked first with 20.0 percent and conglomerates with 19.8 percent. College students most hoped for small businesses (28.4 %), followed by conglomerates (24.6 %) and government employees (15.4 %). As the school year advanced, however, the percentage of college students who desire to work for small businesses increased to 14.7 percent in the first grade, 17.1 percent in the second grade, 18.7 percent in the third grade, and 22.6 percent in the fourth grade. The percentage of college students who want to work at large companies decreased to 26.1 percent in first grade, 23.8 percent in second grade, and 23.1 percent in third grade. Among college students, the most frequently answered that they "" knew but never used "" (64.3 percent of four-year college students and 66 percent of undergraduates) support their career path. University students experienced the most among career support services offered by universities with professor of major course counseling (68.7 % of four-year-old university students and 78.4 % of college-education students).

"Britain, which has doubled the price of gas in Italy, was also involved in an emergency explosion at Baumgarten, Austria's highest natural gas supply facility in four years. In Italy, where gas pipes are relied on, gas prices are skyrocketing due to a supply disruption. If recovery is slowed amid a cold spell, concerns are rising that prices could continue for some time. The British daily Financial Times reported that daily gas prices nearly doubled in Italy. Italy, which receives 30 percent of its natural gas through gas pipes, has finally declared a state of emergency in energy supply. The Netherlands is also known to have shown a steep rise in prices.  The gas pipeline hub exploded in Baumgarten, eastern Austria on July 12, sparking a blaze. ▽ Baumgarten : The natural gas supply hub facility exploded in Baumgarten, eastern Austria, killing one person and injuring 21 others. Operation Sine with Gas Connect Austria blamed the cause of the accident as a "" technical problem "" and immediately shut down the facility. A Baumgarten source said, "" The fire was put out by the end of the day, but the time of the return of the gas supply is uncertain. "" The Baumgarten hub facility is considered Europe's largest natural gas facility. Natural gas imported from Russia, Norway, etc. is distributed to Austria, southern Germany, and Italy through gas pipes. It is responsible for nearly 10 % of European gas demand.To make matters worse, the suspension of the North Sea oil pipeline in the U.K. has raised concerns over the energy turbulence in Europe. Inneos (IN EOS), Switzerland, operating the largest pipeline in the UK, was unable to repair a damaged pipeline in the Apredianshire area. FPS supplies the UK with approximately 40 % of the production of crude oil and natural gas from the North Sea. As a result, the British natural gas market is also flourishing. British gas prices soared 46 percent to 99 pence per pound per fiber. The price of natural gas for January 2018 also surged nearly fivefold to 75p, the highest in four years. The sudden cold weather played a part in the gas price hike. The record cold spell that hit Britain last weekend is heating up until the beginning of the year. As a result, UK gas demand has already soared by 18 percent. Massimo Di-Ordeau, consultant at Wood McKenzie, an English energy consultant, diagnosed the European gas market as facing a "" perfect storm. "" If the supply is not resumed as soon as possible and the cold spell continues, the price of gas could remain strong for some time, he warned. Meanwhile, the recent gas price hikes will raise doubts about ' energy security ' in the United Kingdom, FT predicted. It is pointed out that the UK could be at any time in the face of its high dependence on old equipment. Britain is increasingly dependent on energy imports for its continued decline in North Sea oil and gas production. Lee Hye Mi ReportHam How to Live Saver Ruck BE The Ministry of Public Administration and Security announced on Jan. 13 that the new law on public restrooms, which were revised last May for the convenience of public toilet users, will go into effect starting Jan. 1, 2018. As the waste paper next to the toilet in the public restrooms, which had been accompanied by foul smells and pests, disappears from next year, the waste paper can be thrown into the toilet. Women's restrooms are equipped with water-catching cases for disposal of sanitary equipment. When a woman is cleaning or repairing a men's restroom, and a man is cleaning or repairing the ladies ' room, the user's discomfort is reduced by guiding the entrance to the room. The new or remodeled restrooms are designed to prevent human rights and invasion of privacy by preventing the view from outside. However, the Ministry of Public Administration and Security recommends local governments to improve existing restrooms by installing entrance seals. As men's restrooms are required to install urinals, privacy disputes over the use of urinals will be eased. However, it applies to restrooms for new or re-finished facilities and budgeting. Yoon Jong-in, director of the Regional Division of the Ministry of Public Administration and Security, said, "" In order to quickly settle down to the private bathroom culture without the waste paper, the users ' habit of responding and practicing it was important to improve, and the public restrooms were not allowed to be empty.

The government announced plans to activate rental housing registration with various benefits However, if it is judged that rental business registration is not active until 2020, the government will introduce a rent registration policy, and review the measures by implementing a cap on the transfer tax and contract renewal system. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced yesterday its plan to promote rental housing registration with the Strategy and Finance Ministry, the Health and Welfare Ministry and the Ministry of Public Administration and Security. Registered rental operators will receive maximum tax and insurance rates, but will support long-term rental for more than eight years to induce long-term rental.[Graphic] Plan to Promote Rental Housing Registration Major contents The rent increase rate is limited to 5 % of the existing contracts, so the monthly tax ceiling applies and the lease period is guaranteed to be renewed for four to eight years. First of all, the government will resume separate taxes on rental income earners less than 20 million won per annum until next year, as scheduled, and impose health insurance premiums again. This would greatly increase the tax and the burden on the owners of the land with annual rent of less than 20 million won. The government will increase the required expense rate for rental income tax to 70 percent for rental businesses, and reduce the cost of unregistered to 50 percent, making the tax less expensive for registered businesses.Rental Housing (PG) [Manufacturing Assistant] [20 million won or less] registered as a rental business will reduce construction expenses by 80 % and 4 % over the next year, depending on rental period. In addition, the reduction of acquisition and property taxes on apartments registered as rental housing will be extended by three years from the end of next year to the end of 2021. Among the property tax reduction targets are apartments or apartments, multI-family housing, which are mostly owned by the working class. The exemption of transfer income tax will be strengthened with the benefit of long-term rental businesses focusing on 8 years or more.When registering rental housing, the Act on Special Taxation and the Income Tax Act were revised to reduce tax and to reduce premiums. Park Seon-ho, director of the ministry`s land division, stressed that the key target of increasing tax burden is multiple home owners with more than three homes and higher-rental rental operators who don`t register. In addition, due to the revision of the Housing Lease Protection Act and the Enforcement Decree, the lease contract renewal period will be revised from one month prior to expiration to two months. The procedure by which the tenant subscribes for a guarantee to return the rent is immediately repealed.▽ Government : Residing rental housing registration (Yonhap news) = Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport Kim Hyun-mi announces plans to activate rental housing at the government office of Seoul on July 13.

If rental is registered with a local government to facilitate registration of rental businesses, tax offices will automatically apply for registration. The government also planned to prepare a comprehensive reform plan to reform the real estate taxation system, including the assessment of the rent deposit and the ownership tax for multiple residents, through the ongoing special committee on taxation and finance reform. If the government determines that the effect of the registration of rental apartments has decreased since 2020, it will gradually enforce mandatory registration requirements and introduce new contract renewal requests and impose a mandatory monthly limit. "" We plan to add 1 million units to the registered rental limit of 2 million units over the next five years, "" Park said.

"The rate of litter is higher for the No Jung-rae Zoo Expeditionation Kids … When tigers were larger, the 7th Birthrief Chich Zoo's family tree was destroyed, and the tiger species that were later dereginerated from wild day were later. Tiger Runs on a Wild Eye One of the most popular animals at the zoo provided by Clip Art Korea is a tiger. It is also a symbol of zoos. Most people who come to the zoo want to see tigers. Especially, grandmother and grandfather who come up from the countryside and do not see other things, but must see tiger. Especially, tigers are meaningful to Korean people. It was a mascot of the 1988 Seoul Olympics. We will meet with the mascot of the upcoming Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Because of this, the zoo also put the tiger back at the edge of the facility or at the entrance. It is a strategy to see other animals while going to see tigers.There were originally nine kinds of tigers left in the world to the zoo, but the three species of tigers (Vali, Java, and KaspI tigers) were considered to have died out in the 20th century (also known as the 10th species). The first species died out very long ago, and it was not known when.BallI tigers disappeared from the earth permanently on September 27, 1937, and Java tigers and KaspI tigers were wiped out from the earth in the mid 1970s. As forests were turned into land or farmland due to the increase in population, the number of habitats decreased dramatically, and the food chain was destroyed and they were believed to have disappeared. Tiger fur and bone lovers have also helped with their extinction. Currently, six species (Bengal, Siberia, Sumatra, Malaysia, Indochina, South China) are still alive. Among them, the tiger can only be seen in zoos. There are only five kinds of tigers that live in the wild. How long will tigers live? Sadly, the lifespan of tigers in the wild has never been accurately determined. The zoo has two species : the Bengal tiger or the Siberian tiger, mostly the Siberian tiger. Baekdu Mountain tigers are included in this list. Until 2016, 6300 Siberian tigers were registered in the genealogy of Lipschich Zoo in Germany. So far, 2,300 of them have died. According to their genealogy, the average age of a person who dies after being born and the breast is seven years and two months. Shorter than expected In 1995, the individual who died at the Madison Zoo lived the longest, at 22. Tiger in Action Amrigation Program at Seoul Zoo viator@hani.co.kr That's just to be prepared to die young. They also breed up to two small tigers at a time, up to seven tigers at a time. This means that many of them do not grow up to become adults and die. As another example, Chamgae lays 4,000 to 5,000 eggs per litter. That is why most of them die and can only save one or two of them if they give birth to one or two babies. Information floating on the Internet indicates that tigers live for 20 to 26 years. Considering the age of objects that live long lives, excluding objects that die young, this means that they are estimated to be 20 to 26 years old. I donated it because I thought I was purebred ... Then, what was the average life span of a tiger who lived in a zoo in Korea? The average age of a tiger who died in a zoo in Seoul is 11. Of course, there were even tigers that lived longer than him. Seoul Zoo Tiger lived longer than Siberian tigers that lived in zoos around the world. Tigers are an endangered species and can not be traded commercially. Integrated management is performed worldwide. Each individual has their own unique number, such as their resident registration number. When the babies are born, the team will report their birth number to Lipschich Zoo's Tiger Management Team in Germany and receive a unique number. When a birth certificate is received, the paper checks who the parents are and whether they are hybrids and if the document is purebred, the child registers it. That is, the World Tiger Pediatrics. Some Korean tigers are listed on the family tree at the zoo, while others are not. "" White tiger, "" a model animal of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics mascot, "" Sugarang. "" I digitally edited it. When the Seoul Zoo moved to the current Seoul Grand Park in Gwacheon, Gyeonggi Province from Changgyeongwon, a company donated a tiger listed in its genealogy by importing it from overseas. As we learned a few years ago, it was unfortunate that the tiger was not purebred. It was on a family tree, but one of the ancestors was not purebred. Other countries that took their descendants are in the same situation. The correction was in progress. The Tiger Management Team at the Liftchich Zoo in Germany admitted its mistake and advised it to be corrected. In fact, the zoo with its descendants has done nothing wrong. He merely believed in the genealogy and raised it. No wonder he had no procedures for verifying obedience at the early stage of tiger registration, as he did not have gene analysis skills back then. Photographs must show him indistinctly. To make sure that tigers survive, it is unnecessary to make a reckless remark that some tigers you have are not purebred. There is no need to worry at all. They can stop breeding and wait for their biological lives to end. All you need to do is give birth to a pure breed. It won't be long. You don't need to have many populations at a certain zoo to succeed the Sunjong Tiger line. Many zoos must secure obedience to their pets and systematically reproduce them so that they do not reproduce themselves. Individuals at other zoos at home and abroad should also be exchanged for more diversity. This should not be neglected and the budget should not be spared in order to perform the zoo functions. It doesn't cost that much. Until now, they were delayed due to lack of money or even took descendants of Seoul Zoo with them. For local governments to keep their zoos healthy, the purchase and exchange of animals for their healthy homes must be arranged with sufficient costs. We hope to take the initiative from Jeonju Zoo, where we recently took off to build an ecological zoo. Tiger Crane was born as a ' hybrid ' and died this year at Seoul Zoo's zoo. Cranes trapped in Wonju Dreamland, Gangwon Province, before returning to Seoul Grand Park. Different reporter Nam Jong-young's stallion, but known as the zoo's residents live about 20 percent longer than the wild. The reason is that they are examined for their health at the zoo, freed from hunger, and protected from predators. This summer, a tiger named ' Crane ' who lived at the Seoul Zoo died at the age of 17. In terms of life expectancy alone, a crane is an old man, and he has lived a long life even when compared to the entire Siberian tiger genealogy.

But I don't know whether 100,000, 200,000, 300,000, or local voters can get good policy pledges, good messages, good speeches, or not, but lawmakers don't really know about it. It is very difficult to vote for people, and I was very grateful. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung, did you actually plan to go to the finals? How was it? I did not think it would be until the final round of the movie. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Frankly. So he did, to a certain extent. New Floor Leader Kim Seong-tae of the Free Korea Party (GNP), Kim Seong-tae > himself was definitely present. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Were you there for sure? The winning candidate was quite the loser. I will not let go of the rent strike even if it is the first time an opposition leader is accused of violating the National Assembly Law. Moon Jae-in government's arbitrariness and to ward off a populist fighter, arbitrary line.' I thought you were going to war. No, how do you feel? I will be a fighter. Whose son Kim >, Moon Jae-in now we are now enough to government eight months after coming along? As the main opposition party was not like the opposition, not only our own party, but also the general public, were criticized with such a great deal of criticism. Although the government has been taken away, the people of Korea have made the Korea Freedom Party the main opposition party, and that is to check the government's unilateral monopoly under the value of compensation. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : The value of repair. And that's not to say that we should be held accountable to the previous leadership, but to say that we haven't really changed our constitution for the opposition. In that regard, I will stand as a warrior against such a supreme leader who can overcome the lethargic opposition parties ' systems from now on. It was Moon Jae-in government's arbitrariness and dominance against this populist policies and to fight against political revenge. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung becoming a warrior. He continued to emphasize the rental action because he saw a congratulatory message from the ruling Democratic Party. I put it out yesterday. Let's be happy, let's be happy. You're meeting with Woo Won-shik, floor leader. When you see him, you'll probably say the same thing. Let's play ball and keep going. So what would you say about that? Mr Kim : I personally think Woo Won-sik is a very good politician. Just before you start this show, there's a call for you. Did you talk on the phone? We made a call. I will pay a polite visit today. Let's talk when we visit. But I called myself earlier and said, I met an opposition party that is fighting properly. Let's fight well. ' We exchanged calls. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > (Laughing) Let's fight, forward. Did you, floor leader Kim? Kim Seong-tae : To fight well is not a bad word after all. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > So what is it, Woo? Let's fight well. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Ah, let's fight well with each other. If you're both killed in action, that would make it hard for you to get along, wouldn't it? Kim Seong-tae : If you fight properly, you can recognize each other. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > is it? So, why don't we compete for policies, not against each other? Mr Kim : Yes. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Okay. I'm meeting floor leader Kim Seong-tae. Let's go party leader Hong Joon-pyo, You said this after we finished the National Assembly budget. I will intervene in the affairs of the House.The party chairman will interfere in the parliamentary affairs. I've never seen you speak out in public before. What do you think? Free Korea Party leader Hong Joon-pyo p.m. on May 12, the National Assembly in Seoul policy commission chairman and floor leader in 2017, elected new floor in a National Assembly members.Kim and hands holding. In the party rules of the free GNP, the roles of the party leader and floor leader are clearly divided. That line is not an intrusive, government-controlled structure, because it is so clear that the first part of Hong's secret deal with the GNP in handling the budget is not what the GNP people said, but what we saw as being lethargic about the government. That's how I expressed my criticism. ◇ Do you think it is a expression of criticism from Kim Hyun-jung > Hong, not a genuine intervention? Mr Kim : I see it so. ◇ Have you ever talked about it with Kim Hyun-jung > or Hong in private? Mr Kim : Yes. I wonder if it would have been frustrating to have told her yesterday evening when you had dinner with many lawmakers and you knew the party rules of your own. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > ` I wish I was frustrated? ` I won't go beyond that line. But Hong Joon-pyo Talking, talking in moderate quantities. The truth is the fall of the conservative conservatives these days we talk about the collapse of the maintenance which has lost its dignity was coming at the time and Hong Joon-pyo said that the story is.This came a lot on the race. It's a piece of cake. No, the language of the Hong Joon-pyo, a representative with something like this is okssingakssinhae, but what do you think? Whose son Kim > leader Hong Joon-pyo of the various concerns that say now? Crudely, or direct representation, and that's so rough that many concerns you, but that again. Hong Joon-pyo forward yesterday that the official floor had been a real fight now is some harsh words, straightforward and easy representation of the representative because you are.That fight situation where they can't help but leave that part is to me in the future, I understood that and I upbeat note and the ruling and opposition parties and the conflicts.National affairs, passed away peacefully not that arbitration may be possible to provide a solution in the standoff that could Duckjang as, with a message like that.The atmosphere is what I was feeling. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > I see that. So now, floor leader Kim Seong-tae plays the warrior role. I'll go to the image of self-regulated games as ex-coach who gave upbeat note, Hong Joon-pyo, a representative. You share the role. Kim Seong-tae : So he does not change that innate disposition or that manner of expression immediately. But so far, it has been very frustrating to see the representative deliver the part of the House that he wanted to actually deal with in a direct manner. That's going to be a big reduction. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. New Labour Leader Kim Seong-tae, by the way, was assigned the first assignment. The National Assembly has voted to arrest Rep. We need to hold another day of the meeting. What are you going to do when you have to vote? Sir Kim Seong-tae > has not seen the motion for arrest submitted by the Ministry of Justice yet. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung, didn't you see it? You must first find out what is written on the terms of the arrest agreement and why you need to restrain it. We will then convene a general meeting to determine a response. I want to stress - this is Moon Jae-in regime existing National Intelligence Service of Special Programs that they were taking advantage of as a weapon and means of political revenge. If anything is done before I become floor leader, I am Chairman of the Committee on Political revenge. Such incorrect practices, including special fees, must be corrected, and are you sure to agree to hold the meeting first, Chairman Kim Hyun-jung. Or are you considering holding a conference but not voting? Kim Seong-tae > So I respect Woo Won-sik and Kim Dong-cheol and our former floor leader Chung Woo-taek agreed on the provisional parliamentary schedule in December. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Is the main meeting scheduled to be held on the 22nd? Mr Kim : Obviously the three already know enough about the direction of the investigation in the future, as well as how Rep. Choi Kyung-hwan is being investigated and summoned by the prosecution. As the provisional parliamentary session has been scheduled for December, I respect the schedule of the plenary session scheduled for December, and I respect the three of them as a whole. That also means that we don't have to accept a fully negotiated agenda, or unilaterally, by any argument, of the schedule. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Let me explain briefly, to the listeners : We're being held for 22 days now, the main conference. That day is not enough to report an arrest agreement and vote on it. I have to take another day. So it sounds like you can't agree, right? Mr Kim : I do not think it is up to us to judge now. If you would add a little to the position I am not in"
"◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Why are you so cautious? Kim Seong-tae > The main opposition Grand National Party (GNP) has been packaged thoroughly during the last budget transaction. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Passing was done. Mr Kim : And what is worse, they made a secret deal with each other through a secret conspiracy. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > The people's party and the Democratic Party do not recognize it at all. Kim Seong-tae > In that respect, the Democratic Party apologizes to the nation and the nation is as good as it is. And I need real cooperation and cooperation in parliamentary operations. I need to ask them to have a secret deal, so why would they turn it into a normal deal? ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Okay. It was my first interview today, but I wrote "" warrior "" earlier, and I have heard strong statements from the first interview. We would be interested in what to talk about with Woo Won-sik, floor leader and Kim Dong-cheol, floor leaders. I look forward to your good politics as the new floor leader. Mr Kim : Yes, thank you. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Thank you. Kim Seong-tae, the new floor leader of the Free Korea Party. According to the "" 2017 KB Golden Life Report, "" which analyzes Korea's aging financial design, the Center for Management and Research, 74.5 % of pension funds including pension funds are used to cover their necessary expenses with savings and retirement funds. The results of the survey, which was conducted by the Korea Institute for Research and Development (KIRI), showed 2,000 employers aged 20 to 74 years old who live in Seoul, the metropolitan area and metropolitan area.Among financial assets, the retirement fund was the most expensive option with 46 % of deposits disposed of, followed by severance payments (30.2 %). Also, 38.2 percent of them have disposed of pension funds, including pension. It was also reported that 14.1 percent of those who used debts, and 2.5 percent of those who sold real estate.A semiretiration means that after leaving a long-worked job or a career, one is doing something else under financial pressure, or is looking for a new one. 19 % of all households experienced a semirelegation among their members. The reason why households with semi-retired incomes were disposed of was largely due to a sharp decline in income.About 74.8 percent of the households answered that their income decreased around the time of their retirement. However, 51.2 percent said they spent less after they retired. Income is not what it used to be, but spending remains the same, adding to the burden. In the spending category, the portion of food expenses was the lowest (21 %) before and after retirement. On the other hand, spending on education for children (47.6 percent) increased the most. Regarding the cost of living, 20.5 percent said they decreased and 23.8 percent said they increased the amount.The average age of semi-retirement is 47. The most experienced retreats were aged 55 to 59 (18.3 %) and 50 to 54 (15.2 %), with the highest proportion of people in their 50s being in total.When it comes to finding a new job, economic problems (38.8 percent) were most difficult. The report also showed that 21.1 percent of the respondents were absent with information, 16.1 percent were frustrated, and 7.2 percent were married with their children's education. It was reported that it took the semi-degree generation an average of two years to find a new job. hacho@newsis.com> It is noteworthy that the Korean automobile industry, the Organic Light-blowing Diode (OLED), and the semiconductor industries that are leading the Korean economy may face a crisis due to China's quantitative and qualitative growth. Chinese companies are expected to step up their competitiveness after completing OLED, DRAM and NAND memory factories in 2018. Hana Financial Management Institute of KEB Hana Bank announced yesterday its ' 2018 Industrial Outlook ' and predicted the timing of risks posed by China's growing industrial competitiveness. ▽ China's Heavy Quality and Quantitative Growth StartureData by Industry : Hana Financial Management Research Institute said Korea's cars, along with China's major transportation companies, displays containing OLEDs, and semiconductor industries will face next year. Lee Joo-wan, researcher, argued, "" Light Emitting Diode (LED), steel, cellular phones, and secondary cells have already suffered a long slump due to China's stronger competitiveness, and similar concerns have been raised about the future of automobiles, OLED, semiconductor, petrochemicals and shipbuilding. "" If China`s threat in the past was mostly from overcausing on quantitative expansion, the China`s threat in the future includes quantitative and qualitative growth, which makes it worse than before. The production volume of OLED, DRAM and NAND memory factories in China, which will be completed in the second half of 2018, is not to be sneezed at, according to the analysis. LCD companies will add more LCD units to 50 percent of total output of LG Display and make 20 percent of total production capacity of semiconductor factories. ▽ Export performance unknown 〓 Hana Financial Management Institute predicted that the investment in exports and facilities, which led the Korean economy this year, would run out in 2018. Exports jumped in 2017 due to the "" illusion effect "" of sluggish exports in 2015 and 2016. If the base effect of the past two years is ruled out, export growth in 2017 was just a little bit above the performance of 2014, even at the intellectual level of semiconductors, crude oil and metals, the institute said. Five industries were expected to see an upturn in the 2018 economy, including steel, nonferrous metals, shipbuilding, shipping and clothing. Although the price of raw material for metals has gone up a lot this year, it is very possible for steel and nonferrous metals makers to improve their performance next year as they can afford further rises, Kim Yoo-jin, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute of Standards and Technology said. Conversely, the business outlook was revised down by one or two levels for displays, cars and semiconductors. Given the future direction and growth rates, it is understood that the forecast was not likely to reach an upward trend in 2017. Despite the semiconductor boom next year, it is wise to lower the outlook one step at a time when considering future direction and growth, said Lee Joo-wan, economist at Samsung Economic Research Institute. jasonchoi@fnnews.com Choi Jae-seong : "" fnpas, "" the story of every goal in the world."
"▽ Quick=The KOSDAQ always decreases … 〓 A reason for the virtual currency boom to adjust KOSDAQ even though the financial authorities regulated the Bit-coin-related ` Bitcond ` (Yonhap news) reporter Yoon Dong-jin said on July 12, Virtual coin exchange, Jung-gu, Seoul The day before yesterday, the head of the financial regulator had shown a negative attitude toward the present and present trading of virtual coins, but it did not have much influence on the price of the coins. 2017.12.12mon@yna.co.kr( Seoul = Yonhap News Agency (Yonhap) Kwon Soo-hyeon : There are concerns that the overheated virtual currency market will erode the funds of the domestic stock market. As ant investors turn to virtual currencies to make a single investment, the funds needed to flow out of the stock market, including the KOSDAQ, according to experts. An example is an office worker, Lee (50). A computer company worker, he recently entered the virtual currency market, looking for a place to invest extra money. At first, I tried to invest in stocks when I heard that the Kosdaq market is rising, but I bought a bit of a coin at the recommendation of my friend, said Lee, Fortunately, I made quite a bit of money. A 37-year-old housewife, who has continued to invest in stocks, is also weighing the investment in Bitcone. We have been having a hard time since late last month due to the correction, Yoo said, I have been thinking about investing too much in beatcoins instead of sluggish earnings. It is not easy to see how much money is likely to be transferred or transferred from the stock market to the virtual currency market in this way. However, when we look at the size of the virtual currency and the size of the KOSDAQ market, we can see that the direction of the fluctuations is subtly mixed. Monthly virtual currency transactions rose to 56.22 trillion won in November, more than double this year`s 182 percent, from the 300 billion won level in January, according to the Korea Virtual Monetary Fund. The market accounts for more than 80 percent of the average monthly transaction amount of 68.7.96 trillion won on the KOSDAQ this year. It was May and August of this year when the monthly amount of rainfall especially increased significantly. It jumped from 644.4 billion won in April to 5.17677.9 trillion won in May and 11.89 trillion won in July to 24.93 trillion won in August. The monthly transaction cost of the KOSDAQ market during the same period decreased from 69.37 trillion won in April to 55.329 trillion won in May, and to 59.14 trillion won in August, respectively. In August, when the tech-adjusted Kosdaq index was under control, the daily transaction cost was 2.6.18 trillion won, or 2.45 trillion won on the same day. Market experts also said, "" It is very possible that the funds in the stock market are being transferred to the virtual currency market. "" It is clear that the virtual currency boom, including Bitcone, is playing a role in the adjustment of the KOSDAQ, said Oh Suk-tae, chief economist at Societe Securities Co. As the virtual currency market has very few entry barriers and we don`t have to analyze individual stocks like shares, it seems that it is more controller-oriented than the tech-heavy market, said Oh.Im Sang-kook, head of KB stock market analysis team, also said, It is true that the virtual currency fever is negative in terms of stock market funds. It is highly possible that funds that individual investors have been delivering have shifted to the virtual currency market in a certain part. Individual investors who mainly invest in the tech-heavy KOSDAQ market were more speculative and therefore were more likely to buy and sell single shares than the stock market, he explained, explaining that many of them would have gone into the virtual currency market where transactions were possible 24 hours. Whether the trend continues depends on the government's policies, experts say. The current fever is not likely to cool down easily, given that the popularity of virtual currencies is a worldwide phenomenon and it is not easy to regulate fully, Lim said. However, if the government strengthens the rules on virtual currency and makes it more specific for small and mid-sized venture companies and the Kosdaq market, it will have to put some brakes on it. Oh Suk-tae, an economist, also said, "" Bitcone is more like gold assets than money, but with no fundamentals in place, we have many doubts about the value of it, "" adding, "" If the government's individual investment policies on the KOSDAQ are turned around again, it will make it clear.

"WSJ, Opening of the Cryptocode Investment in Korea and China : "" The Exchange of Coin in East Asia is 80 %. "" Lineships shopping with no other high return investment, the generation of individual users who are not familiar with electronic payment are called "" passwords "" -The Wall Street Journal analyzed the "" Bitcone phenomenon, "" which is showing signs of overheating in Asia on July 12 (local time). East Asia, including Korea, China, and Hong Kong, is the hottest place to start investing in cipher money. Investors are using a Bitcone ATM in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Associated Press reported that the latest cipher suite is distinct from the dot-com bubble that erupted in the late 1990s, with individual investors leading the way. In the event of the dot-com bubble, individual investors rushed to jump into the end of the bubble, while individuals started to participate in the cipher currency boom, attracting the market. Beatcoin prices are currently about 1,600 percent higher than the beginning of the year. `` Bitcone is one of the unprecedented markets with an astronomical rise. Private Asian investors are leading the way, said an official at the Korea Development Institute. "" I feel like the average Joe, who doesn't have the financial knowledge of a professional fund manager, is taking it all, "" he said. Why is Bitcoin fever so hot in Asia? The WSJ pointed out several factors. First, he pointed out that in recent years individual wealth has increased to provide extra money to invest in Asia, especially China and South Korea, but there has been little lucrative investment opportunities available. Analysts say that the money, which had been unable to find an investment destination due to the high real estate prices and the high valuations in the stock market, has been concentrated on the new market, called crypto-money. The WSJ also stated that although it can not be justified, it is possible for Asian youths who grew up experiencing e-commerce and mobile payments to be familiar with the concept of virtual currencies such as Bit-coin. In Asia, we are generally interested in encrypted money, said Vitalik Buterin, founder of the world`s second largest encryption worker. Cryptography is perceived to be wonderful and new to excite young people. In this case, 28, 2016, photo, a man sets up a new replacement machine to connect a child in the country I am quickly becoming rich. The WSJ reported that the 32-year-old man in Busan made a huge profit by investing 100 million won in Bitcone last October. Cryptography is centered on the trade volume of East Asian countries, including China, Japan, and Korea. Japan, South Korea and Vietnam accounted for nearly 80 percent of the world`s bit-coining market last month, according to a market research firm Cryptocompar. The United States accounts for about 20 percent. Asia lightly defeated the United States, the financial center of the world, in encrypted money. From last year until October this year, the Chinese government banned the trading of Bitcons, which was one of the major pillars of the Bitcond transaction. Since then, Japan and South Korea have become more profitable. At one point last week, Korea accounted for 25 percent of the world`s bit-coining volume, according to Coins Hills, a crypto-money data provider. U.S. trade volume was surpassed. Considering that the Korean population is 51,000,000 and the U.S. population is 333 million, it is possible to predict the opening of the Bitcons in Korea. Experts say Wall Street will not be able to attract more specialized investors to the private code market for the time being. `` The cryptograph market will be recorded as the first bubble without a financial investor, '' said Joshua Brown, chief executive of Leitholtz Investment Advisory Service in New York, never once, as `` the general public has overwhelmed so-called big money. '' East Asia, including Korea, China, and Hong Kong, is the hottest place to start investing in cipher money. A young man is standing in front of an ATM machine in Hong Kong. ▽ Hong Kong AP = As individual investors overheated, governments tried to develop the results. Hong Kong regulators warned on July 11 that some exchanges are illegally selling derivatives related to encrypted currency. One day, we will see a body called Bitcone floating down the river, officials said, warning of the danger of Bitcone during an event in Shanghai earlier this month. American media were busy watching Korea's bit-coining craze. Bloomberg reported on July 7 that "" the Bitcone craze has spread widely in Korea and it has become a kind of ground zero. "" As investment fever overheats, Bitcoin is trading in Korea at prices up to 23 percent higher than the international market price recently. The New York Times reported on July 4 that "" anywhere in the world is hotter in the rush to invest in cipher money than in Korea. "" The paper said, "" The Korean population is only one-sixth that of the United States, but the amount of money traded in cipher such as Bitcone is larger than the amount traded in dollars.

The following is an interview with Minister Kim Hyun-mi.After year 2020, registration service will be implemented gradually. There is a ' later than expected ' reaction. Are you planning to move up if the enrollment rate falls below your expectation?- If you implement this policy, you will think that there are more benefits than you expected. There will be many registration for rental housing. I think it would be better to observe these circumstances, see how many voluntary registrations are made, and then determine when or how to apply for registration. There are many issues that need to be revised in the Gaere method. Do you think there will be an election next year? How does the committee organize the tax reform committee? What are discussed?- More government discussion on where to put the special committee on taxation reform should be made. The legal system should be discussed thoroughly between the ruling and opposition parties. However, in many ways, they have worked out an alternative plan under conditions that they can do without changing the law. Therefore, there are not many issues of revision to the law. I think we can achieve this through sufficient discussion between the ruling and opposition parties. When the bill is made, the committee confirmed that the key argument is about what to do with the rent because the current lease registration process is based on the monthly rent. I think it is time to discuss the question of holding taxes intensively.A goal of the registration rental house is to provide rent of one million households for the next five years. What is the standard for figures?- In the past two years, annual rental housing registrations have occurred. Regardless of the system, I said the minimum number because I think it will increase by 200,000 a year and by one million a year. Because of all the benefits this time, I wonder if more people would register.Sungmunjae (mjseong@edaily.co.kr)"
"▽ Construction delay of 1,300 apartments in Hanyang repair=Confederence News = Some apartment building evacuations are getting cold for more than 4,342 residents. As the plumbing replacement project started in August for the fourth straight month, homes were cut off with heating and hot water remaining in the cold, shivering, and holding on day after day.Kim In-yu, a reporter from Gunpo News : More than 342 residents of Hanyang Suri Apartment in Gunpo, Gyeonggi Province, have been shivering for over a month due to delays in plumbing replacement. Residents of Hanyang University Suri Apartment house are beating the cold with electric mats and electric heaters. On the afternoon of July 12, when the midday temperature fell below minus 4 degrees Celsius, Kim's (51, female) visited the front door of Hanyang University and put his feet on the floor. Even though I was wearing thick hiking socks, the words "" Oh, it's cold "" would have come out of my mouth. The temperature indicated on the house thermometer was 10.8 degrees. Kim was wearing a thick padding and fur slippers inside the house. On the carpet upon the floor, there were four layers of electric pads, blankets, and a single electric heater was running next to them. I have been shivering in the cold for more than a month now, Kim said, adding, It is not a good idea to live simply because the water has not come yet. In this apartment, 1,342 residents suffer from the cold in the middle of winter, just like Kim. The 23-year-old apartment started to replace its public water supply and water supply facilities with long-term repair allowance for apartments and a public water supply subsidy of 490 million won from August when the pipes were removed due to the old pipes. Although heating and hot water supply at apartments had been cut off since then, residents endured inconveniences until autumn after summer. The problem is that as November turns cold, residents are starting to get cold. The unheated apartment was just a mass of concrete, cold enough to cool the room down to two degrees. As the cold weather continued intolerably, residents could buy electric pads and heaters to warm themselves up. In addition, I paid more than 200,000 won per house for electricity to buy and use the water heater. However, residents who were unable to turn on the electricity-guzzling electric heater all day were exposed to the cold for a long time and suffered from the flu. Young children and the elderly are suffering enough to live with cold medicines. Park (35), a resident of 804 who moved in last month, said, I felt so cold and sad when I saw eight-month-old children float by the cold, I felt so sad and nervous as a mother.Kim In-yu, a reporter from Gunpo News : More than 342 residents of Hanyang Suri Apartment in Gunpo, Gyeonggi Province, have been shivering for over a month due to delays in plumbing replacement. Residents of Hanyang University Suri Apartment house are beating the cold with electric mats and electric heaters. The mother of a 4-year-old boy, identified by his surname Lee, set up a heating tent in her bedroom at hedgehog@yna.co.kr812 and put a thick hot water mat in her room. Without hot water mats and heated tents, we would probably have frozen to death, said Lee, adding, Many residents of apartments have been evacuated to their sons and daughters and relatives ` homes to avoid the cold. In fact, a 60-year-old man from 824 dong has been staying in a nearby 36-pyong apartment with his wife and daughter since July 13, leaving his 46 pyeong apartment empty. Monthly rent and two-house apartment management combined to cost more than one million won per month, but it is considered a good choice because they simply could not live in a cold. Hot water and heating have yet to be supplied, claiming that the supply will resume on July 10 and 30. No less dangerous than the cold, residents face insecurity about their safety in the event of a fire. Because of the sudden overload of electric heating appliances, the power supply in the park is being knocked out, and the sprinkler system is not working due to the overlapping of the replacement of fire pumps. Residents of the town hall have urged the city government to resolve the situation by forming an emergency committee. It happened in an apartment with more than 4,000 residents, and the city is sitting back and watching, said an official at the committee, who directed the project not to wrap it up fast or turn it into a bad project. Residents say the city is not actively involved and plan to protest in front of the City Hall on July 14. The city government attributed the delay to the delayed construction of Hanyang Apartment due to its late start and difficult consultations between construction companies and residents ' representatives. As for plumbing work, it is usually common to start construction in April or May before winter comes and finish it by the end of October, but the apartment building was finished three months later.

Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy and National Police Agency officials attended the meeting. A senior government official said, Some measures have been made at the meeting and will be released in the form of news in the afternoon. ▽ What direction will the Virtual Association go? (Yonhap) Kim Seung-Doo : Hong Nam-gi, chief of the Office for Government Policy Coordination, was in charge of the Office of Government Policy Coordination, when the participants of the conference waited for a dark look before the conference on virtual currency coordination at Seoulcheong Company, Seoung-ro, Seoul, Tuesday. Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon said at a Cabinet meeting on July 28, We saw virtual currencies become a speculation. Bitcoin has surpassed 11 million won. Trading volume is all the rage to surpass the tech-heavy KOSDAQ, a serious distortion or pathology is expected if left as it is, the official said. The government has discussed government's task force (TFP) yesterday in order to promptly and effectively respond to the various problems associated with virtual currencies such as Bitcone speculation and hacking. noanoa@yna.co.kr The first part of the Supreme Court (Supreme Court justice, Kim Shin-seong) delivered fines of 580,000 won for three years in jail on July 13 in the mayor's death row for violating laws and political funding laws on criminal charges. Under the Local Public Officials Act, if a sentence with a safe or higher is confirmed, they will lose their jobs. In addition, under the Public Officials Election Act and the Political Funds Act, an election can be nullified when an elector is sentenced to jail or a fine of more than one million won. Lee's wife, 56, who was also indicted on charges of taking bribes from a third party, was sentenced to one year in jail and three years of probation. Mayor Lee received 4.36 million won in bribes, including cash, gift certificates and designer wallets, three times from the head of a transportation company from July 2014 to February 2004 when he took office in Paju. In addition, he is accused of accepting 9 million won in illegal political funds and pretending to have received it legally on nine occasions from March to December 2014 in the name of the rent at an election office.

From left, the Justice Minister at the MultI-Level Ministry, Local Finance and Economy Minister Kim Hyun-ki, Strategy and Finance Minister Choi Hyeong-mi, and Health and Welfare Ministry Director Roh Hong-in announced their plans to activate rental policies at kkssmm99@newsis.com Experts say multiple home owners are more likely to go through the process than the registration of rental companies as the government`s benefits are insufficient to attract multiple home owners. Others, however, say that since the government has carried out a heavy tax transfer since April next year and has been playing with property tax cards, multiple home owners may register as rental businesses due to pressure from the government. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced yesterday that it will increase the number of registered private rental apartments to two million by 2022, which is currently about 800,000 households. The government will reduce various tax deductions (local tax, rent income tax, and tax transfer tax) and reduce the burden on health insurance premiums when registering rental housing. Experts, however, forecast that the policies would not be effective because they do not provide substantial tax incentives to attract multiple home owners and they need to rent at least eight years to increase tax benefits. In addition, it is uncertain whether multiple home owners will register as the rental house registers 5 % per year, whereas rental or rental house prices are increased by 10-30 % every year in Seoul. Multiple home owners are currently at a crossroads of holding, selling, registering a rental home, and donating. The government's announcement is likely to put the clock back. If you had registered as a rental operator, you would have to pay more taxes on your existing bills, whereas the benefits would have been a little bit larger, said Kwon Dae-jung, a real estate professor at Myongji University. Shim Kyung-eon, a real estate professor at Konkuk University, said, It is not fair to say that the annual rent hikes would be much more profitable than the multI-million won cost of construction, and it is doubtful whether multiple home owners would make an incentive to register rental businesses. The government should make up for the registration of rental housing businesses after implementing the policy, according to experts. Although it is more positive for the market to prepare ways to provide exits for multiple home owners, the incentives to increase the number of rental registration are now more positive for the market itself, said Goh Jun-seok, director of Shinhan Bank real estate advisory center. Yang Ji-young, director of Research and Development, also added, "" The rental housing benefits are absent from four-year rentals and are focused on long-term rental periods of eight years with no noticeable improvement in short-term benefits. "" However, some predict that the government will impose heavier taxes on the transfer starting next April, and remove the property tax credit card if the registration of the rental business is unsatisfactory. Multiple home owners who did not feel the merit of the lease registration system significantly could choose to sell and make a bid for the new apartment. Yang said, "" Rather than taking the risk of registering for an eight-year-long lease, I chose to sell it as a ' brainy ' thing, and now I have no idea that I can make a lot of money on my own. "" Park Won-gap, a senior adviser at KB Kookmin Bank's WMStar Advisory Board, said, "" If we plan to sell, we need to settle the balance in the area that needs to be adjusted by March next year so we can avoid paying taxes on capital gains and losses (including tenure).

It is believed to have been not long since the dinosaurs died out 66 million years ago. The penguin was estimated to weigh 101 kilograms. The largest of today's penguins, the Emperor Penguin, is usually 120cm long and weighs 40 kilograms. Gerald Meyer from the research team says that the larger ancient penguin was known as just the leg bone. From the fossils it is estimated that ancient penguins had beaks that were much longer than today to make hunting easier. Penguins also had a brown color, which they say was different from the current black and white color. Meyer said penguins appear to have evolved from ancestors that resemble cormorants, the birds that live on the coast. He added that the asteroid, which caused the extinction of dinosaurs, was a huge blow to other large sea reptiles that ruled the ocean at the time, and that animals such as penguins that jumped into the ocean and hunted for food could have flourished.
