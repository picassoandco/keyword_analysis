"" Park Geun-hye government last year, gukjjeong nongdan of the scars of donations from the citizens interest in putting a damper on 100 billion won donation to charity ‘seed new hope’ in place of corruption.Incident broke out. Chairman Yoon, 54, and his representative Kim were accused of collecting 128 billion won in donations from 50,000 people over the past four years to help underprivileged children and teens. Community Chest of Korea has set up a ' Love Temperature Tower ' at Gwanghwamun Plaza in Seoul to help alienated neighbors during the holidays. The temperature tower of love rises by one degree each time it reaches the targeted temperature of one percent. As of July 6, the temperature of the temperature tower is 14.5 degrees. Yoon, 54, the chairman of the new Hope Seed, a journalist organization of Jang Jin-young and the ruling camp, was found to have spent the money they raised on a luxurious life such as a yacht, party, and golf trip. There was a case of Yi Young-hak here. Lee Young-hak, 35, who is tried last month on charges of molesting, killing her daughter and then splashing off her daughter, was found to have spent 1.2 billion won in donations. The whole culture of donation seems to have subsided, said an official at the charity. According to Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs ` July 2015 report, donation participation rates among people aged 15 years and older fell to 36.0 percent in 2011 and 29.5 percent in 2013 and 2015 percent each year. Canada's participation rate in donations was 82 % (2013), and the U.K.'s 67 % (2015), 2.3 to 2.8 times higher than that of Korea's. While we don`t see a significant trend in the series of events since the end of the year campaign began, we are concerned about whether donations are being used properly, a Community Chest official said. We are really concerned about less of a helping hand. Herbert Bank`s chief executive officer Huh Ki-bok, who is sponsored by and delivers the briquettes to the underprivileged each year, said, Contributions have decreased by 15-20 percent since the same period last year. The biggest factor will be slow recovery, but it can also detect an atmosphere that is rather chilly due to the scandal. Lee Young-hak, a father of molars who was arrested on July 16 for luring, molesting, killing a junior high school daughter and releasing body, is in Seoul's northern district court for the first trial. Contributions were also asked to carefully determine where to use Jang Jin-young's donation. Individuals and businesses alike have become more interested in whether donations were spent transparently, an official at the foundation said. More and more people have asked how they can identify the place of use even at street fundraising, said an official at a welfare foundation. According to the Policy Report on Sharing and Recognition Status (2016) released by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs last December, 93.5 % of donors ' organizations and institutions felt that disclosure was important to boost donation culture. The ' Not Important ' response was 4.3 %. When asked how well Korean donors are disclosing information, 72.5 percent answered that they were "" not doing well. "" The opinion of being "" doing well "" was 17.1 percent. Choi Hang-seop, a sociology professor at Kookmin University, said, We understand the purpose of pursuing public interest, but there is a lot of distrust in Korean society due to corruption or the diversion of funds in some organizations. The disclosure of huge donations to the MI-K Sports Foundation in the case of the National Assembly's Agriculture Organization has also discouraged donation cultures from conglomerates suffering from measles. Leaders of large corporations who attended the National Assembly hearing on Dec. 6, 2006 [Central Photo], some large corporations have set up various devices, including a strict donation process. It is analyzed that the two countries had suffered measles by appearing in large sums of money to sports foundations such as the Mir and K in the face of the state's concentration camps. Samsung has only received board approval for donations of more than 50 billion won in the past, but lowered the amount to 1 billion won since last February. We have been suspicious since last year and have to make the disclosure more transparent to the public, an official at Samsung Electronics explained. A large company official said, Contributions or sponsorships to certain groups or sports events can be misleading and we should carefully assess the validity even if it takes some time. We have tried to select the most reliable donation group possible, said an official at a financial firm. Ha Jun-ho journalist ha.junho 1 Joongang.co.crk. The cause of the accident was discovered more than a month ago. Let's connect the reporter to learn more. Jeong Yong-jin, a reporter at Yong-jin University Did you find the cause of the accident? Police announced at 10:30 a.m. that the cause of the tunnel accident was brake failure. Police say they have lost control of the vehicle's brakes as the lines to the battery were peeled off, creating several flares, which in turn caused a hole in the brake fluid pipe. [Question 2] Channel A reported earlier that the flame was on the underside of the vehicle, right? Before the accident, I caught flames sparking under a zigzag vehicle. Experts have raised suspicions that the results of the video analysis may indicate a possible brake failure. Police then began to examine the car carefully. Although the results were originally expected to be released in about two weeks, the simulations concluded that the accident was caused by the loss of braking power in less than a month. Eventually, a non-braking accident vehicle hit a median barrier after driving on a road at a speed of 70 kilometers per hour, crashed and exploded. [Question 3] We also pointed out that the goods in the accident vehicles were not properly distributed. Did you confirm this? The accident vehicle was a five-ton cargo truck with more than seven tons. The oil can, which was on impact at the time, was thrown into the opposite lane, and then the fire spread quickly and caused more damage. Police checked the CCTVs, and confirmed that packages were not properly distributed. Police have booked a criminal case against the company's freighter chief and safety manager.

"Hindrance in the last minute loans to the stimulus in raising housing price by deregulation at dj 盧 global housing ‘There's no cure’ to the lack of an all-out ‘a war against speculators’ in 2008 the Government.Regulations to financial crisis as ‘July 4 and 7’ to atrophy mb pureojwo Park Geun-hye called government stimulus to ‘balloon effect’ of the regulation on All In, a belated 文 to household debt once the Government.July 2013 “Long-term excessive access control policy effects” household debt was less than a trillion won for the full success the Assembly Strategy and Finance Committee held a ‘Household debt policy hearing’. It was designed to discuss the causes and solutions of the surge in household debt, but only what the ruling and opposition parties called the "" Nevertracks Siege "" took place. As the opposition, Democrats Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye of the government's economic policies ‘blunder’ and accused the ruling Saenuri Party card deregulation of the government is Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun.Take responsibility for the government to focus on.The parliamentary committee on financial affairs in October conducted an audit of the Bank of Korea in the same way four years ago. 14 trillion won over the responsibility of the household debt problem is Park Geun-hye of the Government's rate-cutting campaign in attacks and the ruling party, Roh Moo-hyun administration has higher growth rate of household loans.The opposition's comeback at odds with each other. The argument remained that the problems were caused by each other, but only by the ruling and opposition parties.Since the 1997 IMF financial crisis, the Korean economy has been in endless agony between its goal of boosting the economy and its side effects of debt. It is in a "" dilemma "" that fears a deregulation in order to revive the economy would result in a sharp increase in household debt, and a stronger regulation would weaken the trigger for an economic recovery. The democratic and conservative governments have held power for 10 years, but none of them have solved this dilemma very well.Kim Dae-jung government is the Asian financial crisis hit the stagnant economy since his inauguration in 1998 in order to stimulate the housing transfer income tax cuts, After stabilizing the abolition of easing requirements of the application process and other real estate.Deregulations in. As a result, apartment prices in the nation rose 38 percent and apartments in Seoul jumped 60 percent during the term. As the demand for mortgage loans increased sharply due to the increase in housing prices, the government introduced the LTV in September 2002 and required regulations on the ' LTV 60 % ' to reduce the loan ceiling to 60 % of housing. It has also stepped up efforts to strengthen the soundness of the mortgage market by requiring individual credit rating measures.However, it was not easy to catch the heated investor sentiment and the demand for loans. Bank of Korea, The former president a (ccsi) index of consumer sentiment survey of the first quarter of 1998, his first year in office csi was on the verge of retirement plans, real estate purchases, the final quarter of 2002, 8 to 14.Gone up.Roh Moo-hyun government staged a “The sky is as real estate, but I two.”, and it's war against real-estate speculation. It proposed measures 12 times in five years, including the establishment of a comprehensive real estate tax, reinforcing transfer income, limiting the sale of land, and designating a "" bubble seven. "" LTV lowered to 40 % and introduced total debt payment rates (DTI). However, it did not get "" milk-and-water "", including a 56 percent jump to get housing in Seoul. The main reason for the failure is that the focus was on curbing demand, but the lack of supply caused the houses to lose their price hikes.Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye of a turn by former conservative government president to lead to deregulation. The economy is shrinking as the global financial crisis in 2008, the Lee Myung-bak that fielded ‘7 & 7 4 & policy’ (an average of 7 % growth & & $ 40,000 per capita income into seventh strongest country in the world) the government.A relaxation of the period to limit the resale and the capital & speculative area off speculative areas such as regulations on property, except the three Seoul districts south of the leash. It also reduced LTV to 70 percent and excluded DTI applications for homeless people and one-householders.Park Geun-hye, the government for 2007, a major real estate plans to boost the economy of the expression is ‘debt, buy homes,’. At the time, then Deputy Prime Minister Choi Kyung-hwan reduced the LTV - DTI rule to 70 % and 60 %, saying, "" It is just like wearing winter clothes in the middle of July, 2014, "" right after his inauguration. Household debt has soared here, with the Bank of Korea cutting its key interest rate by a total of 1.25 percentage points five times from August of the same year (2.50 to 2.25 percent). The government, surprised by the steep rise, only hurriedly introduced guidelines for screening of banks ` loans in February last year but failed to see the "" bubble effect "", which led to increased lending to secondary financial and credit loans. As a result, the amount of household debt increase reached 400 trillion won between 2013 and the third quarter of this year.Moon Jae-in, the government ltv (Create new) God stepping up to 40 percent and dti dti, collective ability to repay simsaje (dsr) for the introduction of the super, including regulations to push the baton of government and Roh Moo-hyun.Shape a new party. The Bank of Korea also raised the key interest rate last month, ending a very low rate note that led to the surge in lending. As a result, the number of households who want to borrow money is decreasing. The president took office last month from May until making the monthly average of 103 is household debt csi, Lee Myung-bak government (106), Park Geun-hye the government than (104). Heavy household debt outlook for the six months also 98 lower than for the government (99) Park Geun-hye csi.The problem is that the learning effects of the past administration - raising housing prices since the regulations - and the myth of an invincible property market - have been firmly established. According to a survey released on July 3 by global asset management firm Schroder, 16 percent of Korean investors said they would invest in real estate, including housing, when they received extra money, and thus placed bank deposits at No. 2. Interest in real estate investment continued despite a series of regulations, including the 8~2 Real Estate Measures, the 9~5 Measures, and the 10~24 Measures. This could pose a stumbling block to the government`s goal of curbing rising household loans. Roh Moo-hyun administration failed ‘supply’ must also care about.Lim Jin, director of the Korea Institute of Finance's household debt research center, said, "" Last year's household debt growth rate was 12 %, but it has dropped to around 9 % this year, and there is a possibility of further decline next year, "" and added, "" It has to be fully adjusted so far.

The recordings show the desperation of survivors holding out for two hours and 43 minutes in an upside-down boat. The first fisherboat, the nine-seven-ton, was hit by a tanker named "" Myeongjin 15 "" (366 ton class) and was blown over in an instant by the ‘ overturning ’. Simmo (31), a fisherman who had been here, and two friends eagerly waited for help. Shim urgently asked for help, saying, Please come quickly, and after the six-second to the seventh call, he sent a GPS screen to the Coast Guard. Shim called for a swift rescue in the 7:12 minute 10 call, five minutes before the sub-discipline search and rescue team arrived, calling for a "" breathtaking "" change in breathing. On the 11th call at 7:42 a.m. when the underwater search began, Shim waited a long time to show, "" Please send me fast … "", "" It's been an hour and a half, "" and "" It's too cold … "" The Coast Guard said, "" Since it is the time of the flooding, the water should not be more sticky. "" It helped the Shim and his family relax. In reality, the Shim's family survived because they hadn't been in the water. At 10.5 degrees Celsius at the time of the accident, the International Ocean Search and Rescue Manual (IAMSAR) estimates that the expiator's survival time is less than three hours. If they could not avoid being kept on a shelf and remained in the water, hypothermia could have been the worst case. Finally, at 8:41 a.m., the rescue team and Shim ran into each other with an outer wall of the hull, and at the same time, Shim pounded on the boat and desperately asked for help. Finally, at 8:48 a.m. Incheon rescue team succeeded in rescuing three Shim and his family one by one. It is now two hours and 43 minutes from the time of the accident. The construction of the Simhwa party took a long time because it was not easy to secure a passage because the ship's nets and fishing lines were tangled, as the owners of the ship told us. On the way to the Shim's office, many bodies of fishermen were found and approached in a long time. Three bodies were recovered at 7:43 and two others at 8:07. At the time of the search, the bodies could not be determined and there was a slight chance of survival, so they were carefully brought out of the boat. Shim and his family waited to be rescued in the lower cabin, and their hearts were pounding. Shim told Yonhap news agency, "" We waited for the Coast Guard to arrive with the pitch dark and cold sea water up to our necks, "" adding, "" We waited for more and more oxygen, and kept our breath away. "" At the time, the Coast Guard's rescue team was equally anxious. Incheon rescue commander Lee Sang-hyun said, "" I got on an upside-down boat and kept banging on the floor with survivors. "" He said, "" I had to rescue the birds, but it was difficult to get to where the water was, and the lines were tangled up.

Professor Lee's activities have also led to increased public interest in the local trauma center, which has led to the National Assembly increasing its budget on regional trauma centers. Professor Lee, however, urged lawmakers on the same day, "" In order to fundamentally improve the local trauma center, we need to understand why the regional trauma center system is necessary, not just a one-time increase. "" Professor Lee attended the ` Applause and Challenge ` breakfast held at the National Assembly Hall under the auspices of ruling Grand National Party Rep.

He also stated his opinion on the 53 percent increase in the budget related to the local trauma center during the National Assembly's review of the new year's budget. The budget is not far below that of low-ranking workers, Lee said, although the political circle and the media are deeply grateful for the budget. He says, "" They're doing a good job of actually, they can't project the bottom line. "" "" They built a trauma center, but they didn't actually do it. "" And they treated the average patient hard. He said, "" I apologize to the people in a terrible sense. "" And he said, "" Don't you think the public can build a credit system if their budget increases? But it is not the reality.

"" Seeing his boyfriend make millions of won from investing in virtual currency, he said, "" I'm thinking of quitting the company and becoming a professional investor. ""Virtual money investment is dominated by virtual money pumping forces in Telegram, an overseas messenger app that includes the stock market of an ant grave. Pumping forces send a message to a group messenger window, "" When you expect a coin to rise?

Some coins are making the market nearly double in a day. Their prices fluctuate more than 10 percent a day, but quickly decline.The operators of chat rooms can make a bigger profit by providing virtual currency information faster than ordinary chat window participants to VVIP, which pays millions of won per month to control the market. There is also a pumping force in Korea called Diva (D.va) with a turnout of more than 10,730. They advise you to buy the certain coins at that time. When the ants start to jump in after watching the rapidly rising market, they realize their profits by selling off their virtual dollar reserves.The majority of ant investors who invest in virtual money already know their power.

China's bid to export nuclear plants to the UAE. Once a license is confirmed, nuclear plant exports will be the second time following nuclear plants in the UAE in 2009. The Korea Electric Power Corp. said yesterday that it secured exclusive negotiating rights to acquire 100 percent of the nuclear plant operator Newsen, UK. Once the negotiation for equity acquisition is completed in the first half of next year (January to June) and approved by the British Parliament, Mooreside will be transferred to KEPCO. The two sides agreed to adopt the same model, APR-14004, for Sin-Gori Units No. 5 and 6 construction project. The Mooreside project involves the construction and operation of three nuclear plants at a cost of 21 trillion won.Some say that the U.K., which has strict safety standards against nuclear power plants, has accepted the construction of Korean nuclear plants in recognition of their technology and safety. By refusing China's huge money supply challenge and securing the right to business, the fact itself is also a testament to the history of nuclear plants in Korea. It is closely watched whether it can affect the government's pre-emission policies in the future. The Morside Project, which is to build three nuclear plants in northwest England, is owned by the consortium, Newsen. Toshiba Corp., a Japanese company, owns 100 percent of shares but has attempted to sell its shares due to worsening financial conditions. KEPCO announced its participation in the acquisition in March this year. According to KEPCO and the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the U.K. government showed a lukewarm attitude toward KEPCO taking over Newsen shares. They were unsure of the safety and technology of Korean nuclear plants. A positive atmosphere, however, began to form in July this year when the British government reported to Nyuzen that it was allowed to adopt the Korean nuclear plant model, the APR-14000. China's aggressive push to enter the nuclear plant market in developed countries, while shouting for "" nuclear power "" was enough. Whether or not KEPCO is taking over Newsen has also fallen into the trap. China has attracted Toshiba and Britain with its strong support and enormous capital. On the Moon Jae-in is safe to say the president tarwonjeon government support, and change its policy into a murky future for itself. As construction projects for the new nuclear plant are cancelled one after another and Sin-Gori Units 5 and 6 construction projects are temporarily suspended, concerns have been raised over possible disruptions to the export of nuclear plant. However, in October, the A.A.R-14000 became the fifth European company to succeed in gaining certification as a European operator. The government has also shown signs of the government and the nuclear plant industry joining forces as it sets the policy apart before the elimination of nuclear plants. Another positive factor was the resumption of construction on the Sin-Gori Units No. 5 and 6 construction. At the end of November, Minister of Industry and Industry Baek Un-kyu and KEPCO president Cho Hwan-ik visited the United Kingdom to pay a courtesy call on the Minister of Enterprise and Energy Industry, and signed a memorandum of cooperation with Korean-English nuclear plants. We were selected as the preferred bidder but need to hold additional negotiations to finalize the project, KEPCO said. The Mooreside Project is a structure in which operators are required to raise construction costs and pay for their investment by selling electricity after completion. It is expected that KEPCO will succeed in the future, whether to finance construction costs on favorable conditions or build a stable profit structure from electric sales. In 2009, the UAE (UAE) nuclear plant ordered its nuclear plant to be built, and Korea needed to do so without worries about money. The ministry said, We need to investigate the feasibility study based on a financing plan. If the deficit is forecast, we will lose the reason to push ahead with the project excessively. Once KEPCO has secured the right to operate in the U.K., it will also face a backlash from orders placed with overseas nuclear plants such as Saudi Arabia and the Czech Republic. However, with the construction of more new nuclear plants in Korea being canceled, it is uncertain whether to invest more in nuclear plants or foster more workers. It is because the nuclear industry's ecosystem is likely to be weakened, making it difficult to maintain its technology competitiveness. Now that Korea`s nuclear plant is confirmed to be more competitive, we should consider retaining the expertise of nuclear plant experts and know-how on winning new orders, said Joo Han-kyu, a professor at Seoul National University's nuclear engineering department.Sejong = Lee Gun-hyeok Reporter.com ▶ Facebook by Dong-A Ilbo / Donga.com ; Facebook officially gathers hot economic issues and re-teaching methods (click!) ⑨ Donga Ilbo & donga.com, illegally reproduce and redistribute"

A Foreign Ministry spokesman said, "" With the crisis looming on the Korean Peninsula, at a time when the threat from the lips of top U.S. politicians continues, it is now a given to the North Korean peninsula that it is now a given out war.

We are looking for a person who can get 50 Guri from Mongolia with a total price of 50 cattle.The Ministry of Environment posted an unusual bid late last month. The plan is to purchase 50 copper cows and five deer on the continent for 50 million won and 200 million won, respectively. Copper cattle is required to be brought in within 10 months from the date of contract and deer live on the continent.■ The Environment Ministry has a reason to bid on the purchase. The government is set to build a national endangered species recovery center in Daecheon-ri, Yeongyang-eup, Yeongyang-gun, Gyeongbuk Province, Korea, Korea, Korea, with an area of 25.5 million ㎡. It is to restore endangered species of the Korean Peninsula, which is not well studied by the private sector due to its long time and high cost. The restoration center will open next year. The Ministry of Environment chose Guri, a deer, a golden frog, and a wind egg as its plants and animals to restore their livestock for five years starting next year. However, the problem was securing the objects needed for restoration. The restoration team secured the gold frogs and the eggs themselves, but the cattle dung beetles and the continental deer couldn't find anyone to turn themselves into mothers. Both were originally common species in Korea, but are now almost extinct. Continental deer live only in Russia, China, and North Korea, and the copper bath is found in Mongolia. The bid is to find animal dealers who will be buying the animals from abroad.The import of species involves complicated procedures. The team had two and a half years of talks with Russia to get five continental deer. 200 million won for deer on the continent is the cost of visiting Russia and safely bringing back the already negotiated deer on the continent. As we had to fly our own planes and pass various quarantine inspections to bring in deer, we estimated the total cost to be around 200 million won, said an official of the group.Cervus deer. Unlike the www.biolib.cz picture, the winning contractor must go to Mongolia and pick up the dung beetles himself. However, it is not possible for tourists to collect and bring copper from cattle dung. The Mongol Government shall give permission to collect and remove such materials, and the Korean government shall pass inspection. If the products are brought in without the quarantine authority's permission, they will all be disposed of and fined. Only professional traders who are allowed to get license to import gold products under conditions that quarantine authorities offer, said an official at the ministry, referring to the possibility of bidding for deer in the continent and cattle dung. Even if they have been imported to meet various conditions, there is an acid that should be exceeded. After the deer of the continent and the copper cattle of the cattle dung are handed over to the propulsion team, the promised money must remain alive for more than a month.Since the dung of cattle dung has disappeared, the copper dung of cattle dung rolls around on its hind legs like a ball, making it a familiar bug for Koreans. But why did it have to be hard for the government to find enough to purchase such a large amount? The reason for their extinction is from the native cattle dung. Jeju National Museum of Folk and Natural History Jeong Se-ho said, "" In the late 1970s, cattle were raised with feed and antibiotics, and copper dung from cattle that ate antibiotics died. "" Kim Jin-il, an honorary professor at Sungshin Women's University, spent a decade searching all over South Korea for the copper from cattle dung. Among the cattle dung beetles and insects, the king's cow dung beetles disappeared and the copper bole in the water disappeared, leaving it hard to find any long tassels. They need a ' good cow dung ' to be restored. The restoration center is to contract with a local ranch and keep the cattle dung supplied from the pasture in the refrigerator.Continental deer, also called colour-shaped deer, were also called ‘ maehwarok ’ during the Joseon Dynasty because of their flower-like spots on their bodies. Foreign-in-one deer raised at a farm in YosaI are imported from Japan or Taiwan, and are different from the indigenous species on the Korean Peninsula that the Ministry of Environment intends to revive. The government is seeking the Korean Peninsula's continental deer.Cho Young-seok, researcher at the National Institute of Biological Resources, said, "" Deer don't disappear very well unless they are deliberately caught and killed. "" "" Japan designates the deer as the largest human pest, without any reason, and has killed them all. "" Japanese occupation in dogs and even livestock like cattle carcasses for leather as war materiel. Deer seem to have been sacrificed for the same reason. Another reason is that after liberation, they went through the Korean War and the Korean War, and hunted indiscriminately.< Correspondent Song Yoon-kyung kyung@kyunghyang.com> ▶ Popularity newspaper [Twitter] [View popular free cartoons] ■ Kyunghyang newspaper (www.khan.co.kr), Propose and redeploy illegally"

The government was set to scrap tax deductions on children under the age of 6 and additional deductions for children under 6 years of age from children by 2019 and 2018, respectively, as more than 100,000 won is being paid per month. As 10 percent of the income bracket is excluded from the discussion between the ruling and opposition parties, however, the two working families with higher incomes will be placed in the blind spot, where they can not receive both tax deductions for children and their children. The government has accepted the criticism and is planning to revise the income tax law to allow households without child benefits to receive tax deductions and additional deductions for their children's tax payment at the end of next year.

"" The killer is the party to the Frapumo scandal in 1963, which forced Prime Minister Harold McMillan to resign as head of the conservative Cabinet. Defense Minister John Prapurmo, who was married in 1961, had a sexual relationship for several weeks after meeting with then 19-year-old model and call girl killer at a party. Their relationship was morally reprehensible but there was nothing wrong with it publicly. However, when another lover was found to be Eugene Ivanov, a naval attaché to the Soviet Embassy, during the same time of the killer in late 1962, the scandal was raised to a national security incident. It was more controversial when the Cold War was at its height, and suspicions arose that the killer might be a spy. When a Labour lawmaker raised suspicions about his scandal over national security in March 1963, Prufumo denied entirely his relationship with the killer, saying it was not inappropriate. He then resigned for lying, and the MacMillan conservative government lost in the October elections. "" She had to pay so much for her personal sacrifice, "" said Simur Platt, the son of the killer. Professor Shostack's research team recently released a report titled ` Nature Chemical ` in October last year, but the results of an experiment report, which mainly covers the withdrawal of papers and research ethics, confirmed the hypothesis.

Last year, Shostek's researchers conducted a hypothesis of a long, mysterious life origin of the enzyme, and conducted an experiment called RNA test before DNA, and would have evolved first. They suggested a specific peptide (tiny piece of protein) as the evidence. However, while doing a repeat test, the lab's post-doctoral rescue, Tivoli Olsen, found an error in the results of the peptide research in question. `` It is so frustrating, '' Shostak told Listraction Watch, `` I was not careful or strict enough to interpret the results of the experiments.

Despite strong opposition from the international community, the U.S. has set fire to the powder keg of the Middle East itself. Trump, president, officially declared, ""Jerusalem is Israel's capital"" and (local time) on August 6, the conference follow-up to the State (駐) in Tel Aviv Embassy of Israel.Previously there has also been ordered to surrender them to Jerusalem. Disregarding the unique nature of Jerusalem, a holy place of Christianity, Islam and Judaism, the declaration called Israel Land prompted opposition from Palestinians, the United Nations, and the international community. Since it broke away from U.S. foreign policy that has lasted nearly 70 years since Israel was founded in 1948, its aftermath is expected to be quite severe. Critics say the Middle East could cause Washington to lose its influence. In other words, it is the choice of independent members who only support Israel. Some worry that North Korea has extended its military lines to the Korean Peninsula while the situation on the Korean Peninsula is more tense than ever due to the North's nuclear and missile provocation. But high volatility like Trump the president to take this out at the time of the choices down to it then put the various interpretations are.◇ Measurement of Jerusalem tension himself troubleshooter? - sell this 'chiniseurael' move, but Trump, president of Israel and Palestine to the capital city of Jerusalem.Unilaterally Israel's favor. It also referred to Jerusalem as "" the heart of not just three religions but of the most successful democracy in the world. "" Rather than the nature of being the Holy Land of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, they put a stop to the fact that it is the capital of Israel. "" In the last 70 years, the Israelis have built a country where people can live and worship freely based on Judaism, Islam, Christianity, and all religious beliefs. "" And Trump is ""The United States - to assist in promoting the peace agreement that can accommodate both arms will deeply committed"" president said. As they begin to support Israel openly, some point out that it is almost contradictory to want to promote the already life-and-all peace agreement. But Trump declared remains unsolved for decades this president is rather sluggish as will be an occasion to be of play that led to the peace in Middle East conflict. An anonymous senior official U.S. government ""U.S. Embassy is Jerusalem's broader conclusion of peace can be more beneficial to the president believes that"" on the show abc.Said. In other words, he, who claimed to be the ' master of negotiation, ' threw a unique match. It appears that the U.S. intends to find a breakthrough in the peace treaty by pushing Palestine into a corner and then starting a deal to obtain concessions from the Palestinians. It could also have targeted the effects of the unity of the supporting groups in Korea. Trump was one of the president's key election pledges is before the U.S. Embassy Jerusalem. Christian evangelism groups, which are the main supporters of the Republican Party, are in favor of the pro-Japanese movement. In particular, as the scope of the Russian scandal is getting smaller and smaller, the practice of pledges can help the nation regain its operational momentum by consolidating its core support base. In particular, the first Senate by-elections held on May 12 since his inauguration, and the interim election, the interim assessment of the Trump administration, is only 11 months away.Trump's decision to "" Israel's Capital, Jerusalem "" and his allies ' decision to isolate themselves from U.S. diplomacy in the Middle East could turn into a reckless outcome. He is now giving a chilling look to his European allies. Emmanuel, Mark Long The French president ""can not accept."" and expressed its regret, and Boris Johnson, British Foreign Secretary, said is ""I am concerned."". Federica of the European Union (eu) stresses, ""any action never hurt these efforts should be avoided."", the parent 'meaningful peace process in the Middle East', high-level diplomacy and security gerini.Trump criticized the president. The Middle East is already in a reeking mood. Hamas, the armed wing of Palestine, warned that it was "" a decision to open the door to hell. "" Turkish president, ""brought fury in the Islamic world to blow up a foundation for peace and can cause new tension and conflict."" Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.Out of fear. Jordan's King Abdullah II, the main ally of the United States in the Middle East, also pointed out that "" it will foster extremism and weaken the war on terror. "" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Gutechs issued an urgent statement, saying, The status of Jerusalem should be determined in the Israeli and Palestinian negotiations. Trump in virtually the whole world except Israel, said he welcomed a voice to criticize the president. As a result, some point out that the U.S., which has claimed to be the coordinator of the Middle East issue, could weaken its position and become a self-instruction to create diplomatic isolation. `` It is a reckless decision and a huge diplomatic blunder '' John Brennan, former CIA director, said in an email statement to the Washington Post (WP), `` that is, a huge break in the region's future and has hurt this instability. The U.S. abc is Trump noted the president of the previous promise that it does not come off the top of your embassy.

News and 2017.12.6 a 1 © news iseungbae ""a stop to a straw in, including future generations against the older generation"" ""keep his living as a studio with 90 percent of residents around the school"" (= 1 News, Seoul, Korea) bakttonghae.Journalist : Seoul Urban Planning Commission of Hanyang University dorm to pass a new agenda for the expansion of rental around the school president opposed by farmers and students.Showed opposite positions, respectively. The city planning committee held its 21st town planning committee at 2 p.m. on July 6 and passed a decision to change the detailed facility planning of Hanyang University dormitories. We have been waiting a long time to pass the bill, and it`s a natural result and welcome, said the student council of Hanyang University. Hanyang University's student council held a press conference in front of Seoul City Hall at 1:00 p.m. on July 6 and urged the committee to finalize its plan to build a dorm. Students now claim that Hanyang University dormitories are filled with 11.5 percent and even their enrollment falls to one-digit areas other than externally rented dormitories, the Seoul Metropolitan Government should not stand by and watch over the lives of university students any more. Students said, The deposit and monthly rent around the school is quite high, ranging from 10 million won to 500,000 won, 5 million won to 700,000 won, but the lack of streetlights and police windows always threatened them. Hanyang University students ` union earlier submitted signatures of 2,877 people to the city government and petitions for the passage of the new dormitory planning committee. The committee was also scheduled to deal with the construction of a dormitory at Hanyang University on July 15, but failed to review it when some members left the hall. "" If the older generation, who has both buildings and land, doesn't work and is free from taxes, "" said Professor of architecture at Hanyang University who attended the press conference.Members of Hanyang University's committee opposing the construction of dormitories await the review by the Seoul City Planning Commission on the construction of Hanyang University in front of the new building of the Seoul City Hall. About 70 members of ` Anti-Countermeasure Committee Against Construction of Hanyang University Dormitory ` also gathered in front of City Hall at 2:00 p.m. on July 6.The committee said, 90 percent of residents near Hanyang University live their lives by living in apartments, urging schools, district offices and the city government to recognize the 90 percent of seniors aged between 70 to 80. The committee points out that the schools intend to build 1,600 dormitories with government funds to make more than 20 billion won in revenue projects by holding students hostage.The committee plans to take legal action against schools, Seongbuk-gu Office and City Hall as it passes the plan to build dormitories. A commission official explained, Hanyang University is allowing residents to endure the damages of their residential environment, the right to choose what works, and the traffic laws during the construction of dormitories.The new plan passed the city planning committee and was later approved by district offices. As the Seongdong-gu Office has shown an aggressive attitude toward constructing dormitories, permission will be granted by the second half of 2018. The committee will continue to protest such as filing a complaint or pointing out a legal problem during the district council's review of licensing. The Chinese government is pushing for a policy to convert coal heating, one of the main contaminants in the north, into a gas or electric heating system, according to the newspaper. This year, more than 3 million households in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hubei provinces had gas heating installed, and banned the sale or use of coal heating appliances. The drastic action, called "" smog hell, "" to improve China's serious air pollution has led to a severe shortage of liquefied natural gas (LNG). In northern China, households in Shanxi, Henan, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia, where households are often supplied with frozen homes, are affected by the cold. In some areas, the government has taken down coal heating appliances unilaterally, but since no gas or electric heating facilities have yet been installed, there is no means of heating the plant at all. Several elementary schools in Baoding, Hubei Province have also dismantled their coal stoves, but no gas heating system has been installed yet. Because of this, students are studying out of a cold classroom and placing their desks in a sunny playground. Some students are warming up while running. One parent said, We have been supplying gas for nearly 20 days and no gas heating has been installed in several elementary schools. "" It is winter time when the big snow is sunny and the students are able to feel the warmth of the playground, but we are teaching in the playground even though it is the winter season, "" one elementary school principal said. Due to the situation, frostbite patients are occurring among elementary school students in the area. `` It's so sad to see a child get frostbite, broken-heeled and cracked heels, '' said a mother of an elementary school student in Nanyawar. As a result, we will have all of the relevant facilities ready by night, said Rep. Cho Yang-hyun, Communist Party secretary, adding, We will have no gas heating or electricity at our current elementary schools. However, some schools in the region are reportedly going to use coal heaters as they can not afford to install them for the time being. ssahn@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"【 Bethlehem (West Bank) = Newsis / ap and Donald Trump, president of the United States as Israeli capital Jerusalem and the relocation of the US Embassy announced on December 6.Trump is the Palestinians in Bethlehem (local time) photos and demonstrations ; and burn the Stars and Stripes. The announcement, which has overturned decades of U.S. foreign policy at once, threatens to turn the whole region back into a powder keg and disrupt all peace talks. 【 Newsis / Beirut (Jordan) = ap and chamirye Journalist : Donald Trump, president of the United States attacked Jerusalem the capital of Israel as (local time) which proclaims that 6th Middle East.Bristles in unison across the Arab countries and warned of a ""disaster"" and then. However, there is also a growing voice in the Arab world, which is currently experiencing the worst division in world history, asking what other countries can do about it besides angry messages. Arab superpowers are mired in internal problems, people are tired of wars and civil wars, and Arab leaders have long ceased to have meaningful means to counter the U.S. Arab leaders have spoken out in one voice since Trump's declaration, but right now they have done little to counter any protests from around the world or other than a potential explosion of violence or terrorism. Jerusalem has long been a powder keg and a treasure of the Middle East, but its territorial issues were the only topics that could unite the entire Arab world, which had long been quartered by civil wars and sectarian unrest. But despite predictions that Trump will declare Jerusalem the capital, Saudi Arabia and Iran, the homelands of Sunnis and Shi'ite Muslims in the Middle East, have been fighting for dominance and arguing against each other in the Arab world. Iran's Foreign Minister Jabad Jarif said on Tuesday after the Trump announcement, "" If only certain Arab leaders were to spend half of their money on boosting terrorism, extremism, and sectarian self-integration in Palestine, they would have apparently invested in that. "" The angry accusations of Trump's declaration spread through Egypt, Iran, and Turkey to war-torn Syria. A series of statements criticized the U.S. for its admission of Israel, which is believed to overturn decades of Middle East policy and lead to violent protests. Palestine's chief executive Mahmoud Abbas, in a televised public statement, said Trump had damaged U.S. credibility as the Middle East peace mediator, declaring, "" This is a withdrawal of America's role in the peace process. "" Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, also criticized Trump's decision, saying in a Foreign Ministry statement, "" It violated all international resolve on Jerusalem's position. "" It also said it fears the U.S. decision would have an extremely negative impact on stability in the Middle East and disrupt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. King Abdullah II of Jordan, who signed a peace agreement with Israel like Egypt, told Trump in a telephone interview the day before yesterday, "" If such a declaration was made, Jerusalem would become more violent against Muslims and Christians. "" Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is Abdullah in talks with Turkish president said of the same. Erdogan has already invited leaders of Arab countries to hold a special meeting to discuss the issue of Jerusalem next week of the Organization for Islamic Cooperation (OIC). In Gaza, thousands of Palestinian protesters shouted `` Israel is our eternal capital, '' waving Israel's national flag and the U.S. flag, while Trump's endorsement of Israel's capital was beyond the Red Line. Hamas, the militant group that controls the region, has declared, "" We are now at the crossroads of survival and destruction, "" warning that the protest will continue and become stronger. In Beirut, hundreds of Palestinian refugees marched through the streets, shouting slogans such as "" Trump, You Are Crazy, "" and massive protests took place in front of U.S. diplomatic institutions in Ankara and Istanbul. Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Radondala declared on July 6 that the talks at the Middle East peace talks are now over. In a meeting with European diplomats on July 6, he said the relocation of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem "" will ignite violence and combat across the Middle East. "" But so far, no specific diplomatic actions or plans have been made in any of the countries, and it is not clear whether they have been made. Saudi Arabia, a Sunni Muslim country in the Middle East who was helping mediate the Middle East peace talks between the White House and the Middle East, also strongly criticized Trump's move, calling it likely to provoke Muslim anger around the world in the future. However, it is expected to continue to share information, such as close cooperation with Trump and espionage activities against the Shi'ite nation of Iran. Prince Jae-man, who has emerged as a powerful figure, is also close to Trump. Iran, on the other hand, is expected to show off its status as a guardian of the Muslim world based on Israel's approval by Trump, and will face off against the United States when it comes to matters of Jerusalem, especially Saudi Arabia. In 1973 Arab oil producers banned oil exports to the United States in retaliation for U.S. pro-IsraelI military operations, prompting a surge in U.S. oil prices and an economic shock, leading to Saudi Arabia's dominance and unity. But things are different now. Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt are relatively closer to the United States, and are at odds with the same Arab country for political and religious reasons. Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen are all mired in their own wars and can not afford to go to the brink of destruction for all cities. The Middle East's more complex response to Trump's declaration to Jerusalem could not help but become more violent because the Sunni Arab countries of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are now establishing reconciliation with Israel against Shi'ite Iran. cmr@newsis.comLee Bong-jun, a reporter at Honda [All New Core] [Yonhap News Agency], announced on July 7 that the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport will recall 27,000 foreign cars, including Honda and Lincoln, that have been found faulty in manufacturing.

Compared to the results of a survey a year ago, the employment rate increased by 1.0 percentage point for one child and 0.9 percent for two children, and by 0.3 percentage point for three or more children.The younger the child, the lower the mother's rate. The employment rate for women aged 15 to 54 years old was 46.4 % for youngest children under 6, 60.1 % for boys aged 7 to 12, and 67.8 % for girls aged 13 to 17. Working mothers who live with their children under the age of 18 worked 38.2 hours per week, and the younger their children, the shorter they were. It was estimated that the youngest works an average of 34.7 hours per week for children under 6, 39.2 hours per week for children aged 7 to 12, and 41.1 hours for children aged 13 to 17. Given that the average working week for female employers aged 15 to 54 is 40.2 hours per week, working women who are old enough to have their children go to middle school or high school work longer than average.Vienna Hyun-jun, director of the Employment Statistics Bureau at Statistics Korea, explained, "" I have to spend a lot of time on childcare when my children are young, so I need to spend less time on childcare and childcare.

Physical abuse refers to noticeable violence, such as hitting with fists, belts or sticks. However, Jeff Temple, a psychiatrist at the University of Texas Medical School, said, "" This level of discipline does not necessarily increase the risk of dating even when you experience corporal punishment, such as spanking with a stick or palm. ""In a survey of 758 teenagers between the ages of 19 and 20 in Texas, the researchers answered that 69 percent of teenagers aged 19 and 20 had corporal punishment when they were young. In addition, 19 percent of the respondents said they were violent towards their dates. According to the analysis, those who have physically punished others face an average 29 percent higher risk of dating. This is not based on corporal punishment, but on other factors that will influence the results of physical abuse, sex, age and race. "" This greatly increases the likelihood that a parent could commit dating violence as an adult, whether or not they experienced child abuse. "" "" To a child, parents are the most important and teach him or her about social norms and how to deal with others, "" Professor Temple said, "" the punishment that creates confusion between love and violence during that time is what happened. "" Also, if you learn that even though you can not say that corporal punishment is the cause of adult violence, it is possible to solve conflicts and conflicts by becoming an adult, you can later explain that it is possible to have a close partner.When you experience violence when you are young, you grow more violent. The research team said that 80 percent of the world's children are estimated to receive corporal punishment based on the research published in the United States. However, the American Academy of Pediatrics has opposed spanking children for any reason, based on numerous studies that have shown that corporal punishment has a strong influence on their mental health or aggression. A recent survey of 8,300 adults in California, for example, found that those who were beaten at a young age were 37 percent more likely to commit suicide and take drugs at a higher risk than those who were not. A spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics said that the results of the team's study, "" Although for the sake of the children, and good discipline, "" tend to re-confirmation violence in the home.

Researchers at British Deepminde Corporation, an U.S.-based Google Holding Company, announced yesterday that the latest version of Alphago-Mains had gone blank and had gone through trial and error, surpassing self-educated papers and chess online in a matter of hours. The artificial intelligence taught itself in only a few hours, and it became the third most powerful player in chess and baduk in the world. According to the paper, Sanghwa Alfaro was told to teach only the basic rules of chess and chess and then to go through the war by himself. Previously, artificial intelligence had grown in the way that humans learned the art of ' Jeongseok, ' which was conceived in a long history, and the story of a professional engineer, but this time it did not give such human data. In comparing the long software of winning this year's World Computer and Long-Span Championships in chess with the best players of last year, stock fish, and baduk, whose excellent chess performance was played by two hours, alpha Zero. In the 100 round of matches against each software, the chess team had a long draw with a score of 90-8, the game of 28, the game of unbeaten 72, and the game of go with a score of 60-40. It is the most popular game of baduk. Alpha-zero is the first all-level general flu virus that can be used in different games. It is said that humans learned the rules that they have devised so far by learning themselves in the war. Actual software is already overwhelming the best in the world. In 1997, Deep Blue of IBM America won the World Championships, and Janggi won the victory over its top engineer, Sato Amahiko, in April and May of this year. In baduk, Alphago defeated Lee Se-dol, and was rated the world's strongest performer ; Alpha-Zero was ranked first by China's ninth to beat these software engineers. In particular, he is interesting because he showed that he could become the strongest man in only a few hours, rather than using the great data of a professional engineer in chess and chess. Baduk points out they have already surpassed human intelligence, with experts saying they can not be understood even if they see alpha-priced figures. The newspaper, Nippon Gaiza, expects artificial intelligence to help solve difficult problems that humans could not solve outside of games.

"" Professor Lee, who widely announced his name by treating Captain Seok Hae-kyoon, who was shot by pirates during the 2011 Gulf of Aden operation, recently escaped from the North via the Joint Security Area in Panmunjeom and received a bullet. Professor Lee's activities have also led to increased public interest in the local trauma center, which has led to the National Assembly increasing its budget on regional trauma centers. Professor Lee, however, urged lawmakers on the same day, "" In order to fundamentally improve the local trauma center, we need to understand why the regional trauma center system is necessary, not just a one-time increase. "" Professor Lee attended the ` Applause and Challenge ` breakfast held at the National Assembly Hall under the auspices of ruling Grand National Party Rep. Na Kyung-won and stated in a speech saying, I will feel burdened. Without the medical community or the government community, I wouldn't have to stay quiet at night to avoid flying a helicopter ... ' (although I didn't learn that.) Regarding the process of treating North Korean soldiers who defect to the South, he said, We were unable to pinpoint that it would take more than an hour to reach the hospital and go up to the operating room for any reason, rather than the Middle East (medical system).Park Dong-ju, a professor at the hospital in Aju University, heard Na's speech on the role of trauma centers at a breakfast seminar held at the National Assembly Hall on July 7. As she said at pdj6635@yna.co.kr "" If you get injured, you can imagine that a North Korean soldier has defected to live in a country where you can go to the art room in 30 minutes. What if it takes hours to get an operation after her friend was injured while working in Korea? Professor Lee also released photographs of captain Seok's surgery, which had not been disclosed until that day, and complained of complaints from colleagues who were criticizing him. "" At the time, I was talking so loudly in the medical world about taking a patient on a show at a hospital like Ajudang. "" "" But you don't seem to be a congressman. "" He said, "" Medical people are saying, 'Don't judge and be strong to your point, showman like Professor Lee Gook Jong' of ' opinion and 'main stream' (mainstream).Leader ' "", D-Nev"" (These people would) Minister, shaking the president, (Korean House chief Kim Seong-chan wrote from the Chief of Naval Operations C.N.O.)

The world does not change if one or two of these patients die, the sad part is that it is very hard for even fire helicopters to be treated like strangers and bad people. He also stated his opinion on the 53 percent increase in the budget related to the local trauma center during the National Assembly's review of the new year's budget. The budget is not far below that of low-ranking workers, Lee said, although the political circle and the media are deeply grateful for the budget.Park Dong-ju (left), a professor of Free University Hospital of National Assembly, and Na Kyung-won (left), a senior adviser at the National Assembly Hall for the Independence Movement, held a breakfast meeting on July 7. pdj6635@yna.co.kr he says, "" The lawmakers were good enough, they couldn't project under it, "" and "" They built a trauma center, and they treated you and your patients in a difficult way.

And he said, "" No matter what they say, I will fly night. Even if the ministry does not pay for the doctor's helicopter, we will continue until we say we can not take fire helicopters anymore, the official said.

"Secretary of State for Problems Are the Most Benefit ...The GNP leadership is still holding its own share of the budget, with the National Assembly passed a budget plan to revise its decision to revise the budget for next year by about 800 billion won ($ 150 million), or 200 billion to the National Assembly. Amid the arguments between the ruling and opposition parties, the budget was delayed for the first time since the National Assembly introduced the Advanced Law in 2014, but the budget was still collected by the leaders of each party and secretaries of the National Assembly. The People's Party, which led the campaign in the budget war, was able to provide more than 200 billion won in social overhead capital (SOC) projects to Honam, which is based on the local government. In other words, it is the politics of the budget that the three negotiating parties have invested. The most beneficiaries are those of the pre-articulation committee of each party and those of the three parties who are the most likely beneficiaries of the budget. As the appointment committee members, who are only comprised of secretaries, decided to turn the final increase review into a non-disclosure, the influence and discretion of the secretaries have increased. Among secretaries, members of the People's Party, Hwang Joo-hong (Goheung-dong, Boseong, Jangheung, and Gangjin, South Jeolla Province) showed outstanding propaganda. Hwang earned about 3.4 billion won from eight new projects, including the 550 million won budget for Goheung- Ocheon port, which was not in the government package. Hwang also increased the damages compensation cost for the victims of the Seongang Shinmahang Fisheries and the budget for constructing Goheung-Bongnae National Roads by 1.18 billion won and 3 billion won, respectively, from the previous administration. Rep. First, Kim earned approximately 3.7 billion won (3.7 million U.S. dollars) in five new projects, including the budget of access roads to the Busan Jinhae Free Economic Zone (2.4 billion won) that were not in the government's proposal. Yoon Hu-deok, secretary of the fishermen's party, raised the budget for nurturing the World Culture Clust in Paju, and increased the budget of 500 million won each to add to Paju's mine. As budget monopoly of expectation committee secretaries grows more and more frequent each year, criticism is on the need to improve irregular decision-making patterns such as the pre-articulation committee. Politicians are each searching for regional funds, criticizing the SOC as an increase of 1.3 trillion won and a reduction of 1.5 trillion won in health and welfare budgets from the government. In each of the districts of the party's leadership, the budget hikes of the floor leaders and the chief policymaker remained the same. The liberal party did not attend the budget committee meeting and certainly kept its budget. Jeong Woo-taek, floor leader of the main opposition Grand National Party (Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province), raised about 1 billion won in new business costs, including 500 million won to build Namil-Koeun, Chung-Chung-Chung`s standard highway. In addition, the government secured 1 billion won for the repair of the sewage lines in Cheongju and Miwon-dong, which cost 500 million won more than the previous administration. The chairman of the Korea Party's policy committee, Kim Gwang-lim (Andong, North Gyeongsang Province), also raised 1.5 billion won for installing gas pipes at Andong University, followed by an increase of Andong - Youngdeok and Pohang - Andong - 1 billion won respectively. The ruling party leadership appears to have relatively little budget growth. Policy Committee Chairman Kim Tae-nyeon earned 3.95 billion won in budget increase for the construction of the Sujeong Police Station in Seongnam City, Gyeonggi Province, and Secretary-General Lee Chun-seok of Iksan District Office in North Jeolla Province raised the budget by about three cases. Woo Won-sik (Seoul, Nowon), the main figure responsible for the budget negotiations, secured 125 million won in the government's operation costs of a child-protection institution in Nowon-gu, Seoul. Some analyze that the ruling party leadership's relatively poor performance reflected the budget needed for the government's proposal using the ruling party's premium in advance. Moon Jae-in and feel a burden you with an increase in the examination process of the National Assembly as well as government cuts soc that some also predict. Thanks to the ruling Grand National Party, the SOC projects budget in the Honam region has increased by more than 200 billion won. This is the result of the government and the ruling party's efforts to draw cooperation from the people's party, which is holding the vote, reflected the needs of the Jeolla Province, which is based in the region. One of the most notable projects is the "" Honam Express Railway "" (KTX) Phase 2 project. Regarding the two-stage route from Songjeong Station in Gwangju to Mokpo Station, the People's Party and the Democratic Party of Korea had earlier agreed to apply for a plan via Muan Airport, as the region had hoped. As a result, the government's spending on snow rose 13.34 billion won from the previous administration, which was 154.4 billion won. In the future, additional trillion won will have to be spent. Gwang-ju - Gangjin Expressway was originally planned by the government at 45.4 billion won, but it was added by 100 billion won after the agreement between the ruling and opposition parties and was also raised by 20 billion won. The Mokpo budget, located in the Jeolla provinces, was also raised by Park Jie-won, a former member of the ruling Grand National Party. 300 million won was newly allocated to the establishment of Mokpo University Medical School, and another 700 million won budget was added to the fund. In addition to Gwangju and South Jeolla Province, the regional SOC budget has increased dramatically. An additional 30 billion won has been set up to build the highway linking Saemangeum to Jeonju, as well as an increase of 510 billion won to establish the North Korea`s long-cherished project of developing Saemangeum.

"It is revealed that the number of "" membership points, "" or mileage, that mobile service providers given each year are discarded due to a lack of a place to use. Critics say even the products provided by the service providers are not fully used, causing users to have a significant limitation on mileage.According to the Digital Times ` assessment of membership mileage alliance of the three mobile operators on July 7, no products or services can be used in full without an additional payment. As criticism continues to arise over limiting the use of mile-mileages, some services allow service providers to make payments with 100 % mileage. However, since it limits the payment of mileage to two months and then automatically converts it into cash (credit card), it is not actually using 100 %.SK Telecom has few services to pay full membership mileage. It is enough to give full payment for terminal breakage insurance or replacement program, which costs 4,000 to 8,000 won per month. Even that depends on the ' rate system. ' When using the monthly fee system of more than 70,000 won, one can pay full insurance with mileage, and only 40 percent with a 50,000 won rate and 20 percent with a 10,000 won rate. The remaining amount must be paid in cash or by credit card.Data charging is also available for some discounts through partners. Melon, corn, Bt v 000, and other international phones from affiliates are up to 30 percent off, and there are only a limited number of months to be offered at 50 percent off.KT has a larger capacity to pay 100 % of its mileage, including charging its data. LTE data charging can be virtually charged daily with up to 30 times a month and can be paid in full mileage. There is no requirement for a separate fee. However, the rest of the products are restricted and you can not pay in full mileage. Although the KT affiliate's services Jini (Music) and Media Pack are seemingly 100 percent available for payment, they are automatically converted into cash or credit card payments after two months. LG U-Plus is no different from KT.Purchasing accessories or mobile phones that users find most burdensome to buy makes the purchase difficult to use mileage. It is limited to the maximum limit of 50,000 won, which is 5 % of the installment amount of the terminal. Even if you have 100,000 miles to spare, the maximum number of points you can use to purchase a terminal is 50,000.The Korea Consumer Agency's survey of mobile membership mileage users revealed that 40.7 % (82.55 %) of the average usage rate paid by service providers was expired as of 81,452 points (or 82.55 %).Park Chan-dae, a U.S. Congress Member for DuBoulson, said, "" With a low awareness of mileage, a narrower use, a limit on how much money I use, and automatic dismantlement of numbers, I do not ensure that consumers ' rights are properly enforced and are kept by information per capita.

"Qualcomm Inc. unveiled the snap dragon 845 mobile AP that will be applied in next year`s flagship smartphones. The AP plays the role of the brain of a smartphone. In other words, you can predict which smartphone will be released next year. Mobile on device artificial intelligence (AI), graphics sense of disparity and high network speed are expected.Qualcomm unveiled the next generation mobile AP Snapdragon 845 at the Qualcomm Snapdragon Summit 2017 in Maui, USA, on July 6 (local time).After launching the first snap-driven system on chip in 2007, the smartphone revolution began, said Qualcommission Kisscresin, a senior vice president of product management at Qualcomm. Chip development has supported hardware and software technologies to meet local conditions.Qualcomm has been working with a number of partners, including service providers, manufacturers and government agencies, he said. More than 120 designs were designed and supported by snap-through 835 this year, said Qualcomm, trying to provide a wide range of designs to a number of partners.Cressin explained that he has five major strengths about Snapdragon 845. AI, Immersion, Connectivity, Security and Performance were added. In the past year, he has been confident that he has improved hardware specifications in a variety of ways and has made a commitment to the development of appropriate software.◆ Graphic Mol Optimization and Pre-Cameral Calibration Improvement Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 introduced enhanced Spectra 280 ISP and 630 GPU. For users, taking pictures and video has resulted in higher quality results than ever before. Users who felt dizzy from VR, AR, XR (extended reality) are expected to consume contents in a more stable environment. Qualcomm said it felt more intrusted.Mouling is the constant capture, extension and delivery of the real world via mobile, Tim Lierand, executive vice president of Qualcomm explained. Extended reality refers to virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR).ISPs are processors that specialize in images and help improve quality of content such as photos and videos. Spectra 280 offers a more vibrant image and video shoot function than ever before. Ultra HD (UHD) premium video recording is possible, containing colored information that is 64 times wider than the previous generation of snap dragon 835. Can also play on ultra- HDB premium specification display devices.It is capable of expressing more than one billion different colors and of using 10-bit depth features, such as the 10-bit color scheme to support the wide rec.2020202002 Color area. The technology of brightness measurement has improved.The scan was able to receive HDR 10 support at 720pp resolution and also performed better to the extent that it could handle 480 fps. Imaginary functions with partial image playback within a picture are available. For example, if a child is looking at a fish tank, the only thing you can do is swim the fish in the fish tank.Movement Compensation Time Filtering (MCTF) may be used. Helps increase image quality by enabling maximum inhibition of increased noise in low-control environments.Qualcomm`s comments on the Adrenosse 630 was described as a visual-processing subsystem instead of GPU. It is stressed that it is designed to provide a new XR experience that crosses over virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality.Support 6-character induction using simultaneous localization and mapping. SLAM is a function to recognize the surrounding environment and to display image information on landmarks. Avoid collisions on walls because they not only help users move in three dimensions, but also understand and reflect the surrounding environment.Performance is not the only boost. Qualcomm added Adreno Foveation to the snap 845. This function tracks the line of sight and outputs only the needed areas to maximum quality to support graphic coverage. Eye viewing is of the highest quality, other than by lowering the rental value.Qualcomm SNAP 845, which supports third-generation AI mobile platform and external framework expansion, applied the third-generation AI mobile platform. On the hardware side, GPU, Hexagon 685 Digital Signal Processor (DSP) from the GPU core acts organically for AI. Externally, it helps developers to use different AI frameworks.AI has a huge influence on the development of all industries, said Gary Brotman, Qualcomm`s executive director and general manager of AI and machine running products. AI was generally discussed as being cloud-centered. But now we are moving quickly into the phase of implementing it directly from the device.Brotman stressed that Mobile On Device AI has strong points in prevention, personal security and reliability compared to the existing method of connecting to the network via cloud. Due to this strong point, 8.6 billion smartphones will have AI platforms by 2021, according to Gartner, a market research firm.Starting with SNAP445, it provides easy and easy photo and video filming, enhanced virtual reality (VR) games, and natural voice recognition. Ultimately, it could serve as a personal secretary optimized for users. In particular, the Qualcommission acoustic audio codec WCD041 and Low Power Speech Recognition and Always-On Keyword Detection features provided by the Lower-Power Audio Subsystems provide further improvements in the smart assistant.Externally, developers were designed to use different frameworks. Snapdragon 845 is compatible with Tensor Flow Light, Open Neurel Network Exchange (ON NX), CN TK, and Android APIs, along with legacy supported frameworks for AI such as Google Tensor Flow and Facebook CafeCafe2.It provided software developer kit (SDK) for Qualcomm snap dragon newlear engine (NPE) so that developers can easily select the framework for AI.In reality, switching the video style, measuring depth, and even a single camera can have a Boke effect. Face ID via 3D sensing machine running is also possible. As a personal secretary, it helps to be more responsive, responsive, and natural interactions.◆ Snapdragon X2006 commodity…LTE LTE, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth speed ↑ Qualler SNAP 845 is equipped with the next generation communication modem, snap dragon X2E."" With an LTE speed improvement of 20 % over the X16 modem and a multI-gigabit Wi-Fi and true-wireless enabled by the application, "" said Peter Carson, Qualcommerce, product marketing director.Snapdragon X200T LTE is Qualcomm's second-generation Gigabit LTE communication modem. 12 data paths enable higher LTE speeds. It supports a 5 CA, which can be combined with 5 frequencies. Antenna technology to increase the radio transmission capacity using 4x4 MIMO, using downlink 25 256M, which simultaneously modulates the amplitude and phase of two independent carriers, and transmits the data.In theory, 1.2 Gbps speeds, corresponding to a lowered maximum LTE category of 18, can be implemented. It is fast enough to download 2-hour HD movies in about 10 seconds.In addition to the licensed bands such as LTE, the non-licensing bands have even improved their performance. A public network that the agency pays and uses for the government is called a non-licensed one, such as the licensed band, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. First, the efficiency of the Radio Frequency Accomulation Technology (LAA) between the licensed and non-licensed bands was increased. From the previous 64 %, the G20 LTE has risen to 90 %. The speed of the heterogeneous network is further improved.Wi-Fi can provide up to 4. 4.6bps speed with increased diversity with 60GHz 80GHT.11g. 802.11 Wi-Fi enables connection speeds up to 16 times faster than before. Up to 30 % capacity in dual-band simultaneous connections and an Inter-Commission Wi-Fi network to support continuous app use.Supports Bluetooth 5 of Bluetooth SIG. Simultaneous voice output of several radio speakers, smart phones and other receivers is possible. For example, wireless earphones without wires traditionally played the main role of the left and right receivers, switching data with the device. However, starting with Dragon-Dragon 845, both sides exchange data. This reduces battery consumption in radio receivers by up to 50 %.◆ The importance of security has recently been emphasized after increasing security and low power with the hardware separation subsystem. Security solutions within the mobile platform must also change to meet the needs of users. For example, due to enhanced camera performance, more personal photos and images are saved and shared than ever before. That is, the time has come when stronger security is absolutely necessary.Qualcomm introduced a hardware-separated subsystem, called the Security Processing Unit (SPU), in snap dragon 845. Used to encrypt important information. Application Data Key Management as well as security for the various biometric information used to authenticate.When the image sensor recognizes the user's iris or face, or when the fingerprint recognition scanner sends the related information, such as fingerprint information, to the device, it is internally encrypted and stored in SPU hardware separation subsystem.SPU works as a single core. If there is a chance that another part is hacked, this part can be protected.Samsung's production of the product into a 10-nano second-generation process has increased performance by 10 percent and electricity efficiency by 15 percent.The cryo 38550 architecture redesigned by Quall.5 with ARM Core-Tex technology provides even greater performance and power efficiency. The performance of the game, app installation time, and performance-hungry apps increased by 25 % compared to the previous generation. In the case of the Adrenosse 630, performance increased by 30 % and power efficiency increased by 30 %.Camera and visual processing architecture"
"The video saved up to 30 percent of power when filming or playing games or driving the XR app. The Hexagon 685 DSP is also equipped with third-generation vector solutions to improve AI and gaming performance.Quick charge solution, Quick-ChajI 4.0, is available. Battery charging is possible in 15 minutes, from 0 % to 50 %. The 4.0 version is currently available on 160 mobile devices.According to a global survey, battery life is the most important factor in purchasing smartphones. This is the same for laptops, "" adding, "" It allows 4K UHD images to be played for 4 hours and the radio VR to be used for 3 hours with a feeling of fullness. "" Ultra-HDD voice calls last for more than two days, explained the official.Meanwhile, Qualcomm SN5 will be commercialized in the actual product line in the first half of next year. Samples have already been delivered. It is expected to apply to flagship smartphones of each global manufacturer as well as Samsung Electronics ` Galaxy S9 and LG Electronics G7, which will be released next year./ Maui (USA) = Kim Moon-gi, a journalist at Naver, subscribed to I news 24.Meet the real estate manager at I news TV.[People's News 24] No Transporting or Redistributing] [People's News] : A North Korean naval vessel called "" Hakodate (Japanese Army > United News) "" was found near Hokkaido, Japan's Hakodate, last month. Kim Byeong-kyu, a special correspondent of the North Korean People's Army's 854 Army Unit (Yonhap news agency), was found near the North Korean naval vessel Hokkaido (Hokkaido) on November 6 near the metal board of bkkim@yna.co.kr The newspaper explained that the metal plate on the front of the boat confirmed the Korean alphabet had the words ' 854 soldiers of the North Korean People's Army ' on it, which means it looks like a ship belonging to the North Korean People's Army. In North Korea, the military is also known to be engaged in production activities such as agriculture and fishing. Police are investigating North Koreans found with their ships about their identities and the reasons even for their evacuation. The wooden boat was found with 10 North Koreans onboard off Hokkaido on July 29. They stated that they drifted while working as a squid. The wooden boat called at Matsuma Eco Center on nearby unmanned islands, and North Koreans on board stolen electronic appliances such as TVs from buildings on the island. Regarding this, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, the day before said, We are confirming whether the North Koreans on board were fishermen or not. The wooden boat was found off Hokkaido Matsumae on July 29, and Japan's maritime security office is conducting an on-site inspection outside Hakodate Port. bulls@yna.co.krbkkim@yna.co.kr ▶ Report and inquiry (Click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (Click!)
