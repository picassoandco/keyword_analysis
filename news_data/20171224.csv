The afternoon of July 24, when dense fog and thick dust covered the sky, Incheon Airport was packed with people who wanted to go abroad for Christmas holidays. It was a rush, almost as hectic as the last May and October golden holidays. Some of the most annoying travelers were seen as the delay or cancellation of the flight ended in domino effect the previous day. But most of them looked very good about the trip. I have been scheduling and booking accommodation three months in advance to go backpacking in Europe, said one university student.Incheon International Airport departure area has been packed with people traveling abroad all year. All the airline travel companies made money. However, the nation must expect a deficit of $ 15 billion this year in return. It is equivalent to 2007 ($ 158 billion deficit), when it was the last year of deficit and the global financial crisis. Foreign nationals visiting Korea have not yet visited the country due to the economic recovery, income growth, and the spread of the low cost airline business (LCS), while those who entered the country were not able to follow suit amounted to a record high level.Domestic arrivals this year are expected to top 26 million, up 4 million from last year's 22.38 million. The exit rate of 50 percent from the country is the highest in the world. It is estimated that Taiwan, which had maintained the top spot with the exit rate of 40 percent until last year, was the first country to beat Taiwan. Compared to Japan, which has 120 million citizens and only 18 million (14 percent) leave the country this year, Korea's proportion is high. China's proportion of its people who leave the country (150 million) is about the same as Japan's.Domestic airline companies exceeded 100 for the first time this year as international airlines raced to Incheon Airport to catch the growing number of Korean tourists. Incheon and Gimhae Airport passengers also exceeded the highest levels of 60 and 16 million, respectively. Among the world`s airports, only seven (Dubai, Hong Kong, Heathrow, Schiphol, Paris and Chang-yi) have more than 60 million passengers.Jeju Air, the leader in the low-cost airline business, aims to achieve 1 trillion won in revenue and 100 billion won in operating profit for the first time this year. Sales are forecast to grow 31.9 percent and 54.1 percent, respectively, to 734.8 billion won and 83.9 billion won in operating profit during the three quarters of this year. It has already surpassed the operating profit of 58.7 billion won last year. ▽ Jin Air & T-Way Airlines 〓 It is also expected to record the highest performance for the year. Some industry observers even say that China has shown little impact in retaliating the THAAD system.Travel under the age of 30 is humming along with the biggest travel business ever. As travel needs diversify, package tours are receiving renewed attention recently.Hana Tour, a major travel agency, saw its operating profit rise 46.1 percent, 62.5 percent, and 211.6 percent from the same period last year. Travel industry officials say they are inundated with phone reservations as they focus on package tours to the younger generation, who prefer free travel.Experts say that the biggest increase in overseas travelers this year was the strong influence of the Korean won due to the economic growth rate of 3 percent and the brisk exports.In addition, next year's national income is expected to reach $ 30,000. As a result, the consumer sentiment index hit a six-month high last month since December 2010. The won-dollar exchange rate, which stood at around 1,200 won a year ago, has dropped to 1080 won.The won-yen exchange rate is dropping sharply. On July 22, the rate dropped to 952 per 100 yen, its lowest since December 2015. As the value of the won has soared, the underprivileged and the young who have little money are coming to the airport. It is expected that 29 percent of Koreans who entered the country under the age of 30 will break through the wall for the first time this year.Major hotels in major overseas attractions, which are frequently visited by Koreans, are already almost fully booked for the year. Those who want to go abroad during the Lunar New Year holidays next year can not get a ticket, so they are stomping their feet.Huh EuI-young, a professor of Korean Air Force Management, has changed the standard of overseas travel, whether to go once or twice in a lifetime, explaining the global trend of increasing overseas travel with higher income and more LCCs.Will it be okay as usual, but we should not just look at the soaring tourism deficit and the agony of the domestic industries under China's fierce chase, and see the 50 % departure rate as a positive one for the population? Others remind us that the tourism deficit in 1997, when the foreign exchange crisis broke out 20 years ago, amounted to $ 11.2 billion.We need to look back on our own behavior of traveling abroad recklessly because of the semiconductor boom, said a professor at heterogeneous Kyung Hee University. Efforts to improve tourism infrastructure are also needed to ensure that foreign tourists visiting Korea can enjoy the same increase in arrivals. ""Jeong Chang-soo, president of the Korea Tourism Organization, recently presided over a local office video conference and said, "" It is certain that this is not the case again in 10 years, as domestic arrivals are twice as likely as foreigners to leave. ""There is also a constant demand that the nation's travel "" price-to-price "" should be raised as soon as possible. They say that many tourists feel it is better to travel abroad because there are fewer competitive tourist areas and the price is not low. As shown by the controversy over the Soraksan cable car, many regulations prevent the promotion of domestic tourism.Koo Jeong-mo, head of the Korean Economic Research Institute, said, The tourism industry has a greater value added than the manufacturing industry and has an effect to induce jobs, adding, It is a dramatic move to stimulate demand for overseas travel.U.S. Defense Secretary Park Jae-woong / Kim Eun-jung [Go to Hangyeong.com] [cell phone call for subscription] ⓒ Korean Economy & Hayung.com, U.S. Ambassador to Stop Redistributed and Redistorize War In a speech and dialogue with soldiers at the 82 Airborne Division in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Matis reported that North Korean leader Kim would interfere with Pyeongchang's winter Olympics. I don`t think it is yet the right time to talk about the withdrawal of U.S. troops ` families from Korea, which was mentioned by some conservative groups, including the U.S. Republican Party. Now, we don`t have any plans to withdraw. We are planning to take emergency measures to immediately evacuate the family in a short time, he added. According to the Associated Press, Matis also has the most possible defense against a war when `` dark clouds are gathering '' on the Korean Peninsula and `` are backed up by strong, prepared soldiers. The only way to display authority and power in the words of diplomats is to have you ready. There is still time to solve the problem peacefully, adding that although there is little reason for diplomacy to insist on preventing a crisis on the Korean Peninsula, the AP said there was little reason for the U.S. military to feel optimistic about the Korean Peninsula. In response, Mattis said, "" I should be ready to read this war, "" referring to the book by TR Ferrenbach, urging soldiers to read it once more. Published in 1963 under the subtext of Unprepared Studies, this book, which describes the recent military visit as an American officer, and how a recent U.S. military failure, and a U.S. military campaign, His comments came hours after the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea. As the AP explained, `` While diplomats are trying to break the North Korean nuclear standoff, the U.S. military should do their part by preparing for a war. ''Matis : "" Continue diplomatic efforts … I will make the worst day ever. "" (Guantanamo Bay of Cuba > AP) `` We needed to keep the diplomatic framework as a solution, '' he said, responding to the soldiers ' questions, adding, `` If the diplomacy failed and the North Korean nuclear threat was to be settled, we would make Kim Jong-un, the worst country ever.

"U.S. Marine Forces Commander Robert Neller, who visited South Korea last April, said, "" We should prepare for the Marine Corps, but I hope that this is what happened. "" As the U.S. government recently announced a "" new security strategy, "" which puts China and Russia at risk, the Marines explained it was just a "" four-strike operation. "" According to the Washington Post on July 23 (local time), Neller was visiting Norway on July 21 and saying, "" I hope that I am wrong, "" and "" I hope that I am wrong, "" according to the Washington Post. U.S. Marines have been stationed in Norway since January to support the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the U.S. European Command and seek cold weather and training in the mountainous region. However, Neller and other Marine leaders told Norwegian soldiers on preparations for a shift in peacetime missions, WP reported. Ronald Green, the Marine Corps sergeant at the scene, had another drink. Greenson Green says, "" Remember why you're here. "" "" Just like you see them, they're watching you. Here are 300 Marines and 300 can grow to 3,000 per night. We may raise the standards (that apply here). As Neller is also a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he made a misunderstanding as to whether he hinted at a real war or simply encouraging soldiers suffering in the middle of Christmas. Eric Dent, a Marine Corps spokesman, explained in an admission letter to WP that Neller was meant to `` encourage the soldiers '' in his remarks. "" Thinking about war is how to motivate soldiers to train hard and to get more ready, "" he explained. Dent also stressed that Neller told his soldiers that none of the Russia, China, Iran and North Korea he referred to was seeking war. The president`s remarks on the war were met with concern as tensions continued over North Korea`s nuclear weapons program and the president`s recent announcement of a new security strategy. Potentially threaten the United States in the new security strategy and Donald Trump the United States, aiming to assume the hegemony of the world as China and Russia as a competition it. rice@yna.co.kr ▶ Report and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (Click!)

"Apple's third filing of a lawsuit following Apple's statement : "" It's a long time since I took off "", prompting Apple to collect damages while searching for its compensation claim [Asian economy reporter Ahn Ha-neul]. The plaintiffs, who filed a lawsuit against Apple, are likely to have a bigger impact as they want not only compensation in various forms but also class action lawsuits.IPhone users suing Apple in Central California's Central District Court on July 22. Stephen Bogdanovich, former model of the iPhone Collection, and Dakota Spears, former model, according to Guardian.The plaintiffs argued that they have the right to be compensated, including for a variety of losses, including the replacement of an older phone, purchase of a new battery, and the loss of the company`s value. They were also entitled to claim compensation for ' overcharging ' on their iPhones, for ' intentionally interfering with sluggish phone performance. ' Five users in central California, as well as Chicago, sued Apple. "" It appears that businesses are spending a lot of time covering up their ill-gotten Apple for products that people expect to perform, "" lawyer James Blahakis told the Guardian.The iPhone user, Keaton Harby, then filed a complaint against Apple with northern California, the U.S. federal court. Harvey also argued that Apple has long since taken this step, saying that the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6Gb/s had their batteries turned off and slowed down by more than 50 percent. Apple only gave battery replacement to some iPhones. The accusations meant that a large number of iPhone users were hurt by Apple's actions, and should end up in class action lawsuits. Among the collections submitted to Apple, the Guardian also seeks class action suit status for all users of the iPhone 8 or older in the United States, it said.Collective lawsuits are filed by many interested parties and are limited to securities in Korea but widely used as consumer protection relief devices in the U.S. If one victim wins the case, the other can be rescued without a suit based on the judgment. Volkswagen AG, a German company, raised 14.7 billion dollars in damages to U.S. consumers due to the scandal.Ahn Ha-neul, reporter of the Korea Baseball Organization, ahn708@asiae.co.kr As the global economy is beginning to recover and major countries have begun to tighten their cash flow policies, the market is busy with domestic demand and money, therefore, investment fever has spread to the metal market. As the price of the paladium rose by more than 50 percent, it has emerged as a rising star to chase gold down to the chin. According to Bloomberg's tally on Tuesday, the spot price of the paladium was $ 1,840 per ounce, the highest price since January 2001. Compared to the beginning of the year, the oil price range was 53 percent, five times higher than the price of gold (11 percent). Palladium is used primarily as a smoke reduction catalyst for gasoline cars. Global car sales were brisk this year, and the price of the paladium rose due to increased demand for smoke reduction in Europe and elsewhere. In fact, European car sales rose 3.7 percent this year due to the oil spill, while sales of gasoline cars rose 13 percent, according to investment bank Macquarie. Experts say the high altitude procession of the paladium will continue for many years to come. David Jolley, market analyst with mining firm Anglo-Saxon said, "" The increase in demand for palladium will greatly outweigh its supply growth over the next three to five years. "" The most expensive body in the metal market, the goldenrod, is also being pursued closely. Gold rose 11 percent from the beginning of this year to reach $ 1,274 per ounce on July 22, but reduced the price gap to $ 233 per ounce due to the narrowing of the price of palladium. The price of platinum has already been surpassed by the paladium. It rose only 1.5 percent to $ 917 per ounce from the beginning of the year, and in October, the paladium broke through $ 1,000 per ounce, beating platinum. The humiliation of platinum on the part of the diesel emission scandal in Europe is attributable to the oil and gas shortages. Sales of diesel cars decreased 5.8 percent this year, and demand for platinum used to reduce diesel car smoke decreased. Silver prices rose 2.5 percent to $ 16 per ounce from the beginning of the year, giving the jewelry market a modest uptrend. Meanwhile, metal production rose more than 20 percent en masse to continue to perform "" High Kick. "" The price of aluminum three-month-of-month futures on the London Metal Exchange (LME) rose 29 % from the beginning of the year to $ 2,292 per ton, with the price of $ 725 per ton being nearly a year. Lead was also found to have crossed the 20 percent mark with 23 percent ($ 28,485) and 21 percent ($ 12,130). The return on investment was confirmed. Standard & Poor`s Industrial Metal Index rose 26 percent this year to 1,415 as of Tuesday. China, the world`s factory, has emerged as the biggest variable in the metal market next year. The Financial Times said in an article on July 22 that "" China is forecast to have a strong impact in 2018 as it consumes half of the world's raw material, "" adding, "" The authorities will regulate global iron ore prices and curb excess facilities.

"The first spacewalk without connections in 1984, The Megaplane in the History of the Moon, a space walk without connections, is a real black space on Earth. Bruce McCandless, the astronaut of the space shuttle Challenger, walks freely without a line connecting with the spacecraft for the first time on Feb. 7, 1984. This is said to have been possible thanks to a "" manned control panel "" called MMU. Mattenlis went about 100 meters from the Challenger and came back that day. Among many photos of the universe, the main character of the photo, Maeteondeulis, passed away at the age of 80 on July 21. The picture was taken with a 70mm camera through the space shuttle window right after McEllis went on a spacewalk.

He was a support crew for Apollo 14 and served as two space shuttle crews. The famous spacewalk was performed on the Challenger (STS -41B) in 1984 and Discovery (STS - 31) participated in the deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990. "" I was a little worried, "" he said in 2015, when he first started spacewalk. I wanted to say something similar to what Neil Armstrong said when he landed on the moon. So I said.

After meeting his college friends for a long time and visiting Seoul to take care of the things he was doing, he had to leave shortly. Originally, I planned to have dinner with my classmates, and after having a drink, sleep in a nearby hotel, and then go down the next day, but the room rate was a problem. Upon hearing that the motels near the meeting were cheaper than 200,000 won, Kim had to check the transportation, and then went to Jinju. If you plan to use the store from Christmas Eve to the end of this month, pay close attention to the charge. It is because it is charging much higher than the price of the reconnaissance market due to the fact that it is a stock. According to the industry on July 24, the price of one night accommodation at motels where many people are flocking to the country is two to three times the price of the hotel. You can check it easily through the Internet homepage and mobile app (APP), which accepts reservation for accommodation. For example, the standard price of motels in Yeongdeungpo, Seoul was 50,000 won on weekdays and 60,000 won on weekends, but the reservation cost 135,000 won on the same day. In the same area, J Motel was priced at 40,000 won and 5000 won on weekdays and weekends, but its price was stated at 140,000 won on that day. The same is true of other regions. The D Motel near the entrance to Seoul National University in Bongcheon-dong, Seoul, jumped from 50,000 won on a holiday to 150,000 won on the same day, and increased the Y Motel in Sillim-dong from 50,000 won to 130,000 won. Gangnam, where entertainment centers are concentrated, was no different. The motels for Seocho-dong and L both offered 140,000 won, more than double the price of 65,000 won for the holidays. Some motels were only offered 50,000 won to 70,000 won, the usual weekend price premium. Although the year end on July 31 was cheaper than the first day of this year, the price was mostly 110,000 to 130,000 won, which is double the price of a holiday. Motels officials say the part is beyond description. An official at the D Motel located at the entrance of Seoul National University said, "" If we make a reservation through the app, we can get around 140,000 to 150,000 won. "" And that is cheaper than other areas. A bigger problem is that even if they have reservations to reduce the cost, they can hardly be refunded. Nine out of 10 accommodations that received reservations via mobile apps can not be refunded or cancelled. Some have announced that they will be refunded 100 % only when the cancellation occurs due to the assessment of the vacation spot. In fact, it is possible to cancel reservations unilaterally.Consumers agree that measures need to be taken in view of the ongoing excessive inflated rates beyond the annual prices announced. Chung Jin-woo (24. Nam), a college student who lives at the entrance to Seoul National University, said, "" Apparently, the price was not stated at 50,000 won when I entered the motel.In fact, although the increase in rates is happening year after year in Seoul, even the Korea Consumer Agency, a public institution established to promote the rights and interests of the government, the Seoul Metropolitan Government, and consumers, reiterated its stance. "" We understand that the government and the local governments have not even cracked down on the charge at accommodations for the recent Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, "" said an official of the Fair Trade Commission. "" We have no other means of imposing the increase in the price of the accommodation, "" an official at the Korea Consumer Agency said. "" We have not received any civil service refunds but we can not receive a unilateral cancellation or refund. "" It is not our duty to crack down on the rate hikes at accommodations, a city official said."
"A 33-year-old web developer was arrested in April on charges of opening an adult site and distributing or posting more than 235,000 pornography. At the first trial held in September at the Suwon District Court, Ahn was sentenced to one-and-a-half months in jail. An almost trivial sex scandal is gathering public attention early next month, ahead of a sentence of two. Because it's about virtual money that's creating a speculative frenzy.Ahn asked paid members to make a deposit with 00 gift certificates or Bitcons to pay for adult postings, and then deducted points from each video download. Ahn earned the same amount of money over the past three years, which amounted to 216 bits of coin. The amount of the 216 bit coin worth about 500 million won as of the middle of April when Ahn was indicted amounts to 2.45 billion won as of July 23. Prosecutors have asked the court to collect 1.46 billion won in cash from Ahn, Ahn's family and his girlfriend during the trial, and to confiscate second-bit coins. However, the court ruled that only 340 million won of the 1.4 billion cash in Suwon District Court, and did not approve of the law's seizure of Bitcons.The decision to charge 340 million won in bribes is equivalent to the direct profit of running a porn site. The problem is why he did not accept the seizure of Bit-Coins, but the ruling on the coin, which is not an electronic case, can not be made based on an objective case of the coin, only because it is not considered an appropriate amount of money.The prosecution is recapturing the seizure of 216 bit coins in an appeal. Prosecutors involved in the trial said they would seek further criminal gains from the criminal investigation, confirming that the law on the concealment of earnings from criminals, and that "" criminal gains can be confiscated. ""However, it is likely that the court will have to open the lid to determine what kind of decision will be made about the seizure of Bitcons. Article 10 of the Anti-Container Tax Act provides for the recognition that "" the property can not be confiscated, the nature of the property or its use, and the rights of the criminal (other than its own) in respect, of such property. "" The first trial "" it is not appropriate to confiscate "" is based on this clause and whether or not the second trial will uphold it will change.

"People and tourists flock to Myeong-dong in Seoul on the afternoon of July 23 when the Christmas holidays began. ▽ News 1 / News 1 / 〓 News 1 Park Ji-hye, reporter, Junggye-in income, accommodation and food were 1.45 million won per month, and Choi Gyeong-hwan, a reporter of the social welfare industry, created the most serious job market. According to the National Statistical Office on July 24, the monthly median income per industry was 4.87 million won for the energy sector, including electricity, gas, steam and water projects, and financial and insurance businesses followed with 43.9 million won. On the other hand, accommodation and restaurant businesses were the lowest with 1.45 million won. The statistics were recently analyzed by the National Statistical Office based on pre-tax income of 15 million jobs of wage earners who subscribed to occupational health insurance and national pension as of 2015. It is assessed that the relative reality is accurately reflected by the reliability of raw materials and the size of the target. Those who earn less than the average income of 2.41 million won per sector, are mostly concentrated on the service sector. Bosun Construction and Social Welfare Service (1.6 million won) and Business-Support Service (1.67 million won) are among the most typical low-paid businesses in the world, followed by accommodation and restaurant businesses. It was also lower than the average price of 1.72 million won in real estate and rental businesses, 1.87 million won in associations and organizations, repair and other individual services, and 1.99 million won in wholesale and retail businesses. ② News 1 The low-wage condition in the designer service sector is to discourage the government from taking a revenue-driven growth. Employment in the service industry is forecast to grow from around 70 percent in 2015 to 73 percent in 2020. In the most job seekers, the low cost, low birth rate, and low wages are not enough to get out of the low wages. The government has recently adopted a policy to artificially raise the service sector's pay due to the minimum wage increase, but there are concerns about the possible loss of jobs due to the burden of labor costs. Labor Institute analysis shows that the minimum wage increase includes a 4.97 % rise in food and lodging businesses, and a 1.2-percent rise in labor costs for leisure and welfare businesses (2, 9 %). A ministry official said, "" We have been shifting the government support policies focused on manufacturing to the service sector. "" He said, adding, "" To create more competitive benefits, such as healthcare, games, and other high-value-added services, the nation is likely to have a competitive edge. ""Report!

"There is a delay in the airplane sign at the departure check-in counter at Incheon International Airport on the morning of July 24, when the plane's flight was delayed due to thick fog. Photo : New Sis, passengers visiting Incheon International Airport have experienced some inconveniences due to the disruption in their flight operations. The sea fog was the primary cause, but passengers were more uncomfortable when the airline did not even explain it properly. Furthermore, delays and cancellation of flights due to sea fog are due to natural disasters, making it difficult for passengers to receive proper compensation.Incheon International Airport Corporation announced on July 24 that its flights were delayed or canceled due to the fact that the visibility was shortened due to dense fog, which was mixed with snow, rain, temperature, and sea fog. For an aircraft to make a normal take-off or landing, the viewing distance, the height of the clouds, wind, and runway conditions should be within the safe range for its operation. The project said the company had a setback on all of its 404 flights, including 312, 49 canceled, and 43 returned to Gimpo, Jeju and Gimhae airports during the day. As of 1:00 p.m. on July 24, flight 327 had been delayed and eight were canceled.The Korea Meteorological Administration issued a low visual alert at Incheon Airport from 6:20 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. the previous day. ' Visibility ' is the maximum distance to identify a target, a measure of the turbidity of an atmosphere. That means that lower visibility is less than clear identification of the target. A low-adjustment alert is issued when the visibility range is less than 400 meters, but Incheon International Airport's visibility range has dropped to as low as 50 meters.The weather was then shown to improve, but a low-correction alert was raised again at 5:30 p.m. and released at 11:00 p.m. The police issued a low visibility alert at 1:35 a.m. on July 24, but was lifted at 5:45 a.m.Amid this situation, the airline did not respond very well. Some passengers stayed on the plane for several hours because they had not heard anything from the airline. People who waited for hours were also notified of the cancellation later. Some passengers were extremely disturbed overnight, including being homeless at the airport.However, payment for the delay and cancellation of the flight is insufficient. The Consumer Dispute Resolution Standards Notice requires airlines to compensate passengers for 10 to 30 percent of their fares in the event of late departure. However, natural disasters, weather conditions, airport conditions, and aircraft maintenance are considered inevitable reasons for safe operations and therefore are exempt from paying reparations. In fact, some passengers complained that they had to settle the situation on their own, as the airline refused to provide compensation and did not provide accommodation or transportation services in the face of unusual weather conditions.Even without legal liability for compensation, low-cost airlines can not be free from criticism that they added confusion because they do not have clear response manuals. In addition, some argue that the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs should take measures to alleviate the inconvenience caused by the inconvenience.Public Daily Web site, Kwon Joong-hyuk green@kmib.co.kr[ [Facebook] [Voice of the news agency / link of the national tourism system / traffic report (www.kmib.co.kr), Non-funded and redistribution-restributed by the government's excessive use of excessive traffic and redistribution-ression ' site This is because Jeju Airport is under construction. Amid mounting protests from residents at the airport, the government recently took out a ' re-verification of the location selection validity. ' But the controversy shows little sign of abating as local residents continue to distrust of the investigation process and the government placed its order for a basic plan to build up the Incheon International Airport, apart from an investigation. Society, environmental groups, and experts in Jeju worry that the construction of the airport will intensify the phenomenon of over-tourism in Jeju. They point out that the explosive increase in tourists will cause environmental pollution and impair the quality of life of local residents. They say the government should consider introducing a total tourist quota system in Jeju after canceling its plan to build the airport.Officials of Jeju Airport's main opposition committee hold a ceremony Thursday to review the origin of the construction of Jeju's second airport at the fountain plaza in front of Cheong Wa Dae. World Daily Data Photo : Government, Reinvestigation ... Residents ' distrust on July 24 shows that the location of Jeju 2 airport and the committee on countermeasures (committee on countermeasures against the effects of the accident) are eligible for review.The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced the results of its advance feasibility study on expanding Jeju Airport to Jeju Island 2 in Seongsan-eup, Seogwipo City, Jeju in November 2015. Residents of Seongsan-eup immediately protested. Critics said the process of location selection was shrouded in mystery, and that procedural transparency was not guaranteed. Recently, some people pointed out that 10 nearby hills are inevitably damaged when the airport is built, and that a cave has been found near the planned site, pointing out the error in the use of the site selection.The ministry has accepted such criticism and decided to push for a reinvestigation recently and is discussing the method with the committee in Seongsan, South Chungcheong Province, but the negotiations are going through rough going. We are still reviewing major errors, including the formation of the committee, by placing an order to review the results of the existing feasibility study and leaving it to expert organizations to review, an official at the ministry said. Chairman of the committee Kang Won-bo of Seongsan, South Chungcheong Province, said, "" The ministry does not specify exactly what actions will be taken in the review, and it is only because it is doubtful at what level the error will be. "" Another reason for such distrust is the ministry's order on July 21 to provide basic planning services to Jeju Island 2 after announcing its intention to review the airport. We ordered it before the end of this year to prevent the misuse of the estimated 3.9 billion won of our basic budget, an official at the ministry said, We will conduct a review first before we proceed with the basic planning service. As the consultation with the ministry is not progressing smoothly, we can not help but agonize over a higher level of struggle, Kang said.The Jeju community, environmental groups and experts say the controversy is prompting the ongoing policy to build up tourism in Jeju, which requires an unconditional inflow of tourists. They are experiencing problems with over-tourism in Jeju Island. Overturism is the phenomenon of spreading environmental pollution and harming the quality of life of local residents as more tourists move in than the limit of social and environmental capacity acceptable to the tourist destination. As international tourists grow rapidly due to the growth of low-cost airline companies and the growing number of middle class people in the world, famous overseas tourist attractions such as Barcelona, Italy, Venice, and Paris are treating this over tourism as an important social issue. Professor Kang Seong-il, a tourism researcher, pointed out that Jeju already shows a harbinger of overthurrism by running out of water, traffic jams, waste generation, and land price hikes. In fact, Jeju Island has the highest number of cars per capita in the nation. Land prices were in second place. The height of groundwater on Jeju Island was the lowest it has ever been seen. Because of its nature as an island, Jeju relies 100 percent on underground water for all its water. "" Construction at Jeju Island 2 is meant to add to the number of tourists even more than it is now, and given the current situation, it will deepen overthurrism, "" he argued. As the construction project of Jeju Airport has recently grown at a low cost, and with the implementation of the entry into the country in 2012, it is predicted that the existing airport will be saturated in 2018. Predictions of Jeju Airport demand is 3.11 million in 2020, 3.39 million in 2025, 4.24 million in 2030 and 4.49 million in 2035. Considering that the demand for the airport as of 2015 is 23.09 million, it will almost double in 20 years. We need to review the construction of Jeju Island 2 from the ground up, not from the present level of reinvestigation, said Chang Ha-na, head of the Korean Federation for Environmental Movement, who asked Jeju residents to consider the current quantitative growth in their opinion. Dr. Kang Sung-il also said, Before building the new airport, a thorough examination of Jeju's social and environmental capacity should come first, which requires careful consideration by residents and residents of areas that would benefit from the results.Kim Seung-hwan, Reporter.correspondent hwan@segye.com"
"As the average household increased by just 1.5 percent from a year ago, [Yonhap News Agency] led by borrowing more and purchasing homes (Yonhap News Agency) [Seoul = Yonhap News Agency)], the lowest rate of low interest rates for households decreased. According to the results of a household financial welfare survey conducted by the National Statistical Office, the Financial Supervisory Service, and the Bank of Korea, the average household's financial asset increased by 1.5 percent at the end of March to 78.4 million won. The year-on-year growth rate was the lowest since the statistical organizations involved in 2012. Household financial assets rose 8.4 % from a year earlier and 2.1 % in 2014. The growth rate rose to 3.1 percent in 2015 and to 3.8 percent in 2016, but decreased this year. Financial assets consist of savings, installment savings, funds, stocks, and bonds, plus guaranteed deposits per month. Increased savings, a huge component of financial assets, has declined. The average household savings this year was 73.83 million won. Growth was 1.3 percent year-on-year, falling short of the growth rate of financial assets. The rate of savings was the lowest ever. The deposit for rent is 25.51 million won, up 2.0 percent from a year earlier. The slowdown in the rate of increase of financial assets is largely attributable to low interest rates. The Bank of Korea (BOK) base rate went down to 1.75 percent in March 2015 for the first time, and then broke the record low rate of 1.50 percent in June of that year and 1.25 percent in June of last year. The lowest rate ever recorded a steady state of interest until July 30 when the central bank raised the key rate by 0.25 percentage point. In other words, the interest on savings is chicken feed. It appears households have chosen to reduce their savings, which cost slightly. Instead, he took out a low-rate loan to buy his own home. In 2016, the volume of housing transactions totaled 105,300. Although it decreased from an all-time high of 199,400 in 2015 (2,114,000), it was not a small number given that the annual turnover was less than one million between 2007 and 2013. As they broke the savings they had for purchasing their home, the growth rate of their financial assets had to slow. Kim Wan-jung, head of the asset analysis team at Hana Financial Management Research Institute, said, It has become hard to add more financial assets to the loans and buy homes because of the low interest rate of the funds. porque@yna.co.kr and the news on the morning of July 24 (Click!).

The figure plummeted 52.8 percent from 89.9 percent in the same period last year.New licensees have also plummeted. Only 297,055 new licenses were granted in the first 10 months of the revision, which is only 34 percent of the same period last year (845,244).Instead, there were fewer beginning ' accident drivers. ' Since the implementation of the system, the number of traffic accidents per 10,000 new licensees has decreased by 8.7 to 20.2 (October as of) from the same period a year earlier. The total number of occurrences has also decreased to 591 from 2440.A National Police Agency official said the rise in test standards is leading to the prevention of traffic accidents, in a positive light. It is desirable to manage license acquisition more strictly, as in many developed countries, said Lim Jae-kyung, a researcher at the Korea Transport Institute.However, it is also pointed out that the expense of obtaining a license has increased too much due to the difficult exams. Students point out that the cost of car academies has increased by 30 percent since a year ago. It is because more evaluation items helped increase the cost of expanding facilities and provide mandatory education, said an official at the private education institute, which costs half the cost.Hwang Jeong-hwan / Jang Hyun-ju reporter jung@hankyung.com[ [Go to Hangyeong.com] [Apply for mobile subscription] ⑨ Korean Economy & hankyung.com, no reproduction or redistribution without permission"
"▽ Growth forecast for domestic and foreign organizations, Korea's growth rate forecast for next year = 3.6 % of the world's growth rate will fall below the level of the world for the seventh year. A new market to replace the old one is also likely to grow 3 percent this year, but the Korean economy is still labeled as low-growth. It is likely to continue its low growth rate for the seventh year. Some say that more growth engines should be expanded to continue the information technology sector, focusing on semiconductors.■ According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank of Korea (BOK) on July 24, growth in the global economy this year will reach 3.6 percent. Meanwhile, Korea grew 3 percent this year, falling short of the global economic growth rate.Korea`s economic growth rate has never exceeded the global growth rate since 2011. Until 2010, the Korean economy had grown 6.5 percent, higher than the world's economic growth rate of 5.4 percent. However, Korea grew 3.7 percent in 2011, but the global economy turned around with an 4.2 percent rise. Since then, the Korean economy has been maintaining a low-growth in comparison to the global economy.The same trend is expected to continue next year. The International Monetary Fund forecast for next year's global economic growth rate will be around 3.7 percent, a 0.1 percentage point higher than this year`s forecast. Our economy is the opposite. The Bank of Korea forecast growth to fall to 2.9 percent next year after the economy recorded a 3.0 percent growth rate this year.The reason why the Korean economy is falling into a "" low-growth "" relative to the global economy is attributable to the falling potential growth rate. Potential growth rates are generally the maximum input of production elements, such as capital and labor, to achieve without causing further price rises, which is meant to be the fundamental strength of a country.The Bank of Korea said in its report on economic outlook for the second half of 2017 that the potential growth rate of the nation was estimated to have dropped to 2.8 to 2.9 percent per annum. The decline continued from 4.8 to 5.2 percent in 2001-2005, 3.7 percent to 3.9 percent in 2006-2010 and 3.0 to 3.4 percent in 2011 and 2015 before finally falling below 3 percent. As the basic strength of the Korean economy falls, the strength to bounce back despite the global economic boom is getting weaker. In reality, the U.S. economy grew a mere 1.7 percent last year, a drop of 1.5 percent from the global economic growth rate. Japan also grew 1 percent last year, 2.2 percent below the world's growth rate.The problem is that although the Korean economy has reached the world`s 10th largest, it can not yet be seen as an advanced country. If we stay calm while emerging economies continue to grow rapidly, we may be pursued.Therefore, it is necessary to try to boost the potential growth rate, such as restructuring the economy or expanding the growth engine.With regard to the potential growth rate, the central bank`s vice president Jun Seung-chul said, "" There is a danger that the potential growth rate will fall more rapidly due to the drop in the number of potential people available to produce, "" and stressed a structural reform plan aimed at boosting growth potential.Exports of semiconductors are forecast to grow by 19.9 percent next year from 17.0 percent this year, but Korea`s total exports will fall by 1.8 percent next year, excluding semiconductor exports, according to the Korea Institute of Industrial Economics.If the semiconductor boom turns into a recession without finding new growth engines, the Korean economy will have to suffer greatly.Professor Kim Yong-ha of Soonchunhyang University said, "" It is natural that the growth rate should be decreased because of our growing economy. "" He said, "" It is not yet the first time that we have adjusted our semiconductor industry structure.coddy@fnnews.com ▶ yebyeongjeong news story hitting all the world's goal, ▶ '` Pas ` fn' ※ copyright © 5 Kits combine a star that can be seen in the entertainment news fn unauthorized war damage, The Financial News - redistribution.Won Hee-ryong and Nam Kyung-pil, move the ban on Yoo Seung-min of attention ""a party identity is conservative"" party general meeting (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) remarks with the Red Sea, news, Yoo Seung-min's internal consolidation.Yoo Seung-min = a party leader early on February 22, the leader of the National Assembly, and remarks at a general meeting held in the conference room.

As the discussion on unification has become a topic that has been confined to the people's party and the free party has been excluded, some are skeptical that they will choose the party. The leadership has concentrated on harmony within the party, considering internal unity as a top priority, as leaving the party may not only weaken the party's bargaining power, but also lead to an air decomposition crisis depending on its size.

It is a repair of the proper party identity, Yoo said at a general meeting of lawmakers on July 22. There can be no unity that would damage our identity, the statement is also seen as a message to establish internal unity. Thanks to such efforts, most of the five or six lawmakers who were initially rumored to have been eliminated from the party were quickly restored to their original positions a month ago. There are only one or two lawmakers who are now mentioned as having a second party. We don`t have any more than 11 people left the party, a party source said in a telephone interview on July 24.

The possibility of leaving the party has been greatly reduced. Though outside the party, the actions of Gyeonggi Governor Nam Kyung-pil and Jeju Governor Won Hee-ryong, who are influential within the party, are also drawing keen attention.

"[Hankyoreh] [Toyopan] If you tap into Shin's chart-reading man's ③ political views, the old buzzword is "" Washington's Hollywood with ugly characters. "" Politicians are as popular as entertainers and therefore the entertainment industry is in general uproar. Politicians shouldn't be so noisy ; they shouldn't be so much about beauty ; they should be so obsessed with wisdom and bicyclist that they shouldn't be so much about beauty. But, as the term "" ulzzang "" also implies, the general public is very interested in the politician's appearance, and the politician's appearance is often very controversial. Recently, local media reports of fishermen a week alone, deobul sonhyewon that celebrity class president's appearance that politics will help to be members.There is a matter of praise. Na Kyung-won (the Free Korea Party), who is considered to be an "" original figure "" politician, even argued, "" I benefited from her appearance in the early stage of politics, but I didn't get to be a politician when I was around. "" Gyeonggi Governor Nam Kyung-pil and Chungnam Governor Ahn Hee-jung also appeared on the program and admitted they were good-looking. What is the truth? Will good looks help politicians? Or would it be, as some say, disturbing? Or would that have any effect? Today, we're going to take a look at this problem.Appearance is universal, so Alex Todorov, a psychologist at Princeton University in the United States, recently published a book titled [The Value of Face], published by the journal Appearance and Appropriations Assessment (2005). He used the election data from the Senate to the U.S. from 2000 to 2004 to proceed with the analysis. We hired 843 Princeton residents to show us photos of the winner and the runner-up, respectively, in each of the districts and ask who looked competent. We excluded widely known elections (Hillary's or McCain's or Princeton election) to avoid impacting non-looking elements in the assessment. Let's see what happens. [Figure 1] shows the relative merits of the picture of the two candidates being judged by their students in 95 Senate elections, and how many were shown in the picture on the right (relative to the figures in the left) As you can see by the fact that the trend lines move upwards as you move to the right, the more you look at people, the more votes they're likely to get. Next in terms of election forecast, (I) is where the better-looking candidate is elected ; (III) is where the low-looking candidate is defeated. So these are two areas that demonstrate the myth that politics is the better looking. On the contrary, (II) and (IV) will be a return case. Among the 95 elections, the percentage of looks appraisals and predictions were the same, with the hit rate of 73 %. If an election was held entirely outside of appearances, the figures should be around 50 percent, and this difference was not an accident in the statistical sense. Similar results were found for the 600 parliamentary elections, with a 67 percent hit rate. * Image Touch to Expand Todorov's research has become popular and has since gone on to make similar studies in many countries. It was mainly in the United States and European countries, and, as with most of the previous studies, good people have found good elections. Let me tell you one more interesting example. Businessman John Antonakis of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland and Olmert Dalgas had 2,841 people show a picture of a candidate from the 2002 French general election and evaluate him in a similar way to the previous study. Again, the hit rate was about 70 percent. (election forecast, children's play, [Science >, 2009) What was unusual was that among the evaluators in Switzerland included 681 children between the ages of five and 13, [Figure 2]. A child in Switzerland shocked many when he saw the photograph of a French politician and saw a substantial agreement between what he saw as a leader and what was actually the result of the French election. That's how much I found out that physical evaluation has a universal personality. So far, we've looked at the effect of faces on the part of the politicians by assessing photographs. However, not only your face but also your height and weight are important factors for your looks. Aren't you curious to see if you can analyze this effect separately? Let's start with an interesting study by political scientists Greg Murray of the University of Texas and David Schmitz. (Hematology : the development and development of an evolutionary preference for leadership, "" [Quarterly Social Sciences >, 2011) Their study was conducted in two directions, public consciousness and leadership consciousness. First of all, to gauge voter consciousness, in 2008, he invited 467 American university students from the Midwest to paint "" the picture of the general public and the ideal leader. "" When surveyed, the average leader was more than twice as tall as the people (64 percent), and the average leader was more than twice as tall as the average person in the picture was 6.6 percent. And this tendency was generally observed regardless of where the students came from (America, Europe, Africa, Asia, South America). In fact, in a wide range of animal populations, from apes, such as chimpanzees and gorillas, to African elephants, to red deer, to some birds and fish, the bigger they are, the higher their status within the pack. So the researchers said the public mind has this notion of a leader as big as the public, and that these leaders ' prizes were created from the earliest days of their lives in caves.The results of the U.S. Senate and Senate elections showed the tendency to draw leaders bigger than the public by judging them on their appearances. Students answered questions about their physical characteristics, their abilities as leaders, and their willingness to run, as well as illustrations. As a result, the taller you are, the more positive you are about your leadership skills, and the higher you are, the more you intend to run. But there was a big difference between the men and women. For example, a tall man (184.5 cm) was twice as tall as a short man (169.7 cm) to claim leadership. But in the women's responses, there was no correlation between being tall and self conscious, and height did not directly or indirectly affect her intention to run. In total, tall keys act as a premium for politicians, but the effects were concentrated on men.* Touch the image to expand [Figure 3], which compares the heights of the 20 major countries (G20) leaders with the average height of their respective populations, where male and female leaders compare with average height for males and females. Donald Trump of 15 people, analyzed 10 other American president was greater than national average height of your country, and with German Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.Jacob Zuma of South Africa national average height is president of Korea, Brazil, Russia, like normal people less than the average height. In the case of Korea, however, a young age groups, average height has become so big, considering that Moon Jae-in, president of similar age, not small key. Health Insurance Corp.'s latest measurement data, Moon Jae-in body president was born male average height is born between 1952 and 1953 166.7 centimeters. Does this picture make you think that leaders are tall, too? This is just a small example, and I think we can get a better idea of it after extensive research and research. Let's take a look at your weight this time. Both Hope University psychologists Patricia Rowling and business scientist Mark Rowling of Michigan State University analyzed the results of U.S. Senate elections and intraparty primaries in 2008 and 2012. (' US presidential and electoral weight bias ', [equality, diversity and inclusion >, 2014) When 60 students participate, they can see their upper body photos, see that their bodies are checked and health care professionals can correct their results, starting with very clearly. First of all, if you look at the obesity levels, 34 percent of the U.S.'s population was overweight, 38 percent of the U.S.'s women were obese, but only one percent of the Senate's candidates were male and none were female. Men were about 45 percent overweight, with a similar distribution of candidates, while women were 27 percent and candidates 16 percent. You can see that the heavy weight had an adverse effect on the initial candidacy, unlike tall stature, and was particularly harsher for female politicians.(Figure 4) * From a series of studies that we saw earlier, we have seen that physical characteristics, such as face, height, weight, and so on, have a significant influence on politics. In fact, it's been known for a long time. Ancient philosopher Plato cautioned in a reverse book at : ' Imagine a captain who is tall but has little navigation knowledge. ' But is there a particular class of people who pay more attention to their appearances than to the wisdom of politicians when voting? The problem was analyzed by Gabliel Lenson and Chapeloson, scientists at MIT (who say that the bigger the election, the bigger the election information a person gets, the more information they voted according to the candidate's appearance. So, are the appearances swayed by the voting unique to the less informed and informed? Not necessarily so"
"It's same. Professor Daniel Hampmesh of the University of Austin, Texas, who is considered the founder of the economics of appearance, says, ' The change in appearance is even higher than anything else in the economics election 2006. ' The candidate with the highest 15 % chance of seeing a change in appearance is likely to be the next year. Professor Na Jin-kyung at Sogang University analyzed Korea recently. We asked the University of Texas and 131 students at Seoul National University to show photographs of U.S. senators and governors elections and candidates running for Congress to assess their abilities in appearance. But the results were very interesting : Korea and America were different.Looking at Figure 5, the U.S. election results showed that the evaluation of appearances by American university students and by Korean students did not match that of actual elections by more than 60 percent, and the difference occurred statistically. On the other hand, in the case of Korean elections, there was no evidence that the actual election forecast hit rates of Korean students or American students ' faces had a significant influence on the election, with about 50 percent of the hits expected. Why? I don't think I can get the exact answer yet. Studies show that the characteristics of individuals tend to be less important in the latter case, when compared to more independent and interdependent cultures. So the research team first of all, since the interdependent Korean voters values the social context, they are likely to have more information politically than their American counterparts. Next, the ability assessment by appearances is similar to that of the United States, but I also think it may have been the case that local referendums due to an interdependent culture have less affected the election results.In Korea, besides the importance of looking good, Professor Na Jin-kyung gave us interesting points. So far, I have mostly judged ' capable looking ' as a question of candidate's personal inclination, but I also mentioned ' good looking in nature ' or ' warm looking in Korea ' as social attitudes toward local appearances. Given this fact, it is important to assess one's appearance in Korea, but it may be possible that this is achieved not through an impression of one's ability but of one's social skills. I have worked in the National Assembly for the past few years. Although I don't have an eye for beauty, I can see that most of our lawmakers were handsome, good-looking, and also had a really surprising beautifulness politicians. In Korea, it feels like the effect of appearances is working from the stage when people want to run for politics before an election and choose candidates. I hope more research will be done in the nation in the future. Finally, I would like to emphasize today that it is not up to our constituents to read whether they are striving to combine knowledge and morality with the improvement of their appearances. ▶ Shin Hyun-ho She has been working on figures and charts for 20 years.

[Sign Up for the People and Animals] [KakaoTalk] [Security Council for UN nuclear disarmament and re-distribution of nuclear deterrence in North Korea]So far, the Korean Peninsula has shown a vicious cycle of provocation → sanctions by the international community, including the United Nations Security Council, → resistance by North Korea and additional provocations by the U.N. Security Council → additional sanctions by the international community. North Korea went over Japan's nuclear test on September 12 and went to the North Pacific by a medium range ballistic missile on September 15.Considering the fact that the level of provocation is proportional to the severity of sanctions, it can be regarded as a reason why North Korea can resume its strong provocations such as the launch of a ballistic missile to highlight its backlash and strengthen its internal unity. If North Korea resumes its provocations, the government's plan to adopt a military option is likely to regain momentum, as it will inevitably deal a blow to the two Koreas by delaying the training of the CFC before the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. Unification Minister Cho Myung-kyoon told a special lecture on the standing committee of the Unification Advisory Council on April 20, "" If North Korea makes provocations such as the missile launch, we can only say that the Korea-U.S. joint drill is at an unprecedented time. ""North Korea`s new project plan for the people The North`s state-run Korean Central News Agency reported on July 24 that Kim Jong-un, the North`s ruling Workers ` Party chairman, delivered a closing speech at the fifth largest party cell committee meeting that ended on Monday. Pyongyang : It is uncertain whether North Korea will go into further military action. The resolution adopted includes a clause that triggers or triggers an additional oil trigger to automatically invoke sanctions on North Korea if it makes further provocations. A trigger clause could suspend imports of petroleum products or cut off crude oil supply. If the supply of crude oil is stopped, along with the supply of oil, North Korea's export and import activities will be severely hampered. North Korea, which needs to continue acquiring foreign currency to sustain its regime, may try to turn the situation around with more time to worry about its future moves than the military provocations that trigger the clause. Variables is the New Year message of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who will be announced next week on January 1. Kim`s New Year message is significant in that it determines the direction of North Korea's policies. Experts say that the new message to be announced after the adoption of the U.N. Security Council resolution will serve as a significant gauge of North Korea's future steps.Nam Kwang-kyu, director of the Center for Unification Studies, said, "" North Korea's strong reaction to sanctions and taking provocative actions when they are adopted is the pattern in which we can not stress the current stance of North Korea's nuclear program.In his New Year's speech, Chairman Kim might launch a dialogue and peace offensive rather than a provocation. It is worth noting that Chairman Kim has said in his closing speech at the 5th largest party cell committee on July 23 that he is planning many new projects for the people. Since taking office, Chairman Kim has been strongly pursuing a para-translational route to build nuclear weapons and economics. The declaration of the completion of the national nuclear weapons program can not rule out the possibility of making a major declaration to install the tires of another axis, the construction of an economy, with one tire on the North's car.If the United Nations Security Council resolution on North Korea was adopted before the New Year's announcement, it is possible that the international community has reached its last chance to give North Korea a try, said Kim On-soo, director of the security strategy at the Korea Institute for Military Affairs.Park Soo-chan, reporter of the press at psc@segye.com"

Incheon International Airport Corp. has been pushing for a quick security check and a fast-track that enables exit inspections since 2007. The ministry, on the other hand, only encouraged the use of transportation underdogs and some social contributors for creating a sense of incompatibility. Incheon International Airport Corporation said, "" In time for the opening of the second passenger terminal, we need to expand the number of fast track users to meet the expectation of strengthening the distribution efficiency and international competitiveness of the airport users. "" An official at Incheon Airport said, "" When the fast track is operated, some airport users have the effect of distributing passengers out into the fast track route. "" "" The utility bill could be used for the purpose of increasing convenience, "" and "" as a result, it would have to pay for that facility. "" Airline's management boards and airlines agree that fast track is a global trend and is necessary to provide differentiated service to passengers with business class and higher. In fact, major foreign airlines are operating fast tracks. U.S. passengers are allowed to fast track through the seat system at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York, Narita International Airport in Japan and Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia. Hong Kong International Airport has implemented fast track on its search-only lines since Oct. 16. The amount of use will be paid by Airline. "" Creating a low-ride, more frequent travellers ' entry and exit environment is the trend in the global airport industry, "" said the airline's steering committee, "" to provide fast track and track travel for foreigners and talented customers. "" "" Because of the nature of air services, the service is divided according to the price paid by the passengers, and I don`t know if allowing fast track is creating a sense of incompatibility, "" an airline official said. The stance of the ministry is different. "" There are industry demands that have been around for more than 10 years, but some say they create a sense of incompatibility, "" said an official at the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs. In fact, allowing fast track can cause complaints from passengers. Last year, I saw fast track at LA Airport, Lee said, Some of the group members who went on a group tour felt discriminated against when they checked in. I oppose the introduction here. ■ In everyday life, private companies increase their profits by price discrimination. For example, movie theaters pay different prices depending on the hours used, class of seat, and age. Economics describes this as price differentiation (the different pricing of the same product at different times and in different markets). The movie theater chain "" Cho Jo-cho "" is one of the time-constrained price differentiation strategies aimed at attracting customers with lower prices and earning more profits. Representative amusement park Lotte World and Everland show different situations about price discrimination strategies. Since last year, Lotte World has been selling "" Magic Pass Premium Ticket "" that enables you to ride the ride without waiting. If you pay 30,000 to 100,000 won for admission and receive a premium ticket (selling only 200 tickets per day), you can ride five games fast. Lotte World officials said, There are not many foreigners or time consuming passengers who would make a magic pass premium ticket, explaining that the wait time has decreased slightly when using popular rides. Everland, on the other hand, has a cuface that allows you to ride the ride right away, but it is not for sale. The product is distributed on a first-come-first-served basis, whether as a gift or in the morning or afternoon. "" We considered selling, but the concept of ' buy time with money ' is not familiar in Korea and can cause a backlash, so we don`t sell it, "" an Everland official said. In some cases, the effects of the increase in sales are modest. SijibeI, a CGV official who introduced a seat-ranking system in March last year, said, We have increased consumer choice between seats that are not easy to watch and good to buy. The revenue growth is small. A business fastrack only exit installed at Incheon International Airport's second passenger terminal. Photographer`s offer of the Incheon International Airport Corp. is sharply divided over allowing fast track on `` respect for individual options '' - increased costs of social conflict. Especially because airports are public goods. Some argue that the nation should respect the choice of consumers and receive services that are differentiated as a result of the payment, while others argue that the immigration examination is a national policy, and that it pays the airline seat rate should be respected by the passengers. People who have paid high prices chose to make things easier, such as saving time, said Min Jae-hyung, an economist at Sogang University. It is not a problem to get a corresponding service. "" "" The opportunity (to purchase plane tickets) was given the same, and in the end it is seen as an issue of consumer choice and not a violation of equality. "" Professor Sung Tae-yoon of Yonsei University said, "" Fast Track also falls into some sort of price discrimination category. "" And he said, "" There are some areas in Korea that do not need to be discounted or use the public relations that are not uncomfortable with equality in terms of Korean society. "" On the other hand, there are concerns that it will lose its publicity if it is operated according to the wishes of private airlines. "" Airports are not private facilities for the privileged and the private sector, "" said Joo Eun-woo, a professor of sociology at the central university. Opportunities for airport use and rights should be guaranteed equally to all citizens who pay their taxes. Jeon Seong-in, an economics professor at Hongik University, also explained, "" Providing convenience to non-Japanese passengers with seats over is just an airline level loyalty strategy, "" adding, "" Fast-track is more open to passengers.

Knives and guns are not good or bad by themselves but are meant to be used in what context. Technology is used differently according to context and purpose, but developers who are new to strong technology are also concerned about their role. Developers are responsible for developing them with neutral intent or with good intent, but can not avoid their responsibility in the face of the reality they have developed as a ' destructive ' tool in society. American physicist Robert Offenheimer was the father of the Manhattan Project, which led the Ros Allarmos Research Center in the United States at the end of World War II to develop atomic bombs. When he saw the atomic bomb he had made, which was actually dropped into Japan, killing an incredible number of people, he was shocked and began to repent and reflect. "" I have become a deathtrap, a god of death, "" he said, adding, adding, "" I was in a lot of trouble and spent a lot of time in opposition to the U.S. government's calls for hydrogen bomb development. Alfred Nobel, a Swedish scientist who invented powerful and stable explosives and made a fortune in 1867 to build dynamite, was used as a weapons of mass destruction by calling his invention the ' merchant of death ' and entering the reality of peace. Joseph Weizenbaum, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1966, is an early developer of artificial intelligence who received great popularity and expectations for creating an automatic psychological counseling program. Seeing people indulge in communication with the machine, Eliza argues that the machine can trick people and later turns into a critic of information technology and artificial intelligence. Facebook, the world`s largest social media, was also recently named on the list of developers who were shocked and subsequently repented by the actual use of technology. Chamart Falihapithiya (41) is the first leader to join Facebook in 2007, resign in 2011, and is said to have ' enormous guilt ' about Facebook's recent growth. Facebook's role in the information technology sector, including Silicon Valley, was revealed by online media < VerlI Harpitiya last month. Falihapithia defined Facebook as a "" short-term feedback loop, "" in which a dopamine-operated, dopamine-drive loop operated. He said, Social discourse and cooperation have vanished, leaving distorted information and lies behind. It is not just a problem for the United States, but also for Russian ads (which affected the 2016 U.S. presidential elections), and it is a problem for the world. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter released in the brain when it is stimulated and thrilled, while alcohol, gambling, and drugs are poisoned by structures that promote the release of dopamine. Falihapithiya told the students, I don`t recognize but your actions are being programmed. Unintentional, but you decide how intellectually independent you are and how willing you are to give up something. "" Stop depending on the social media that you are recommending. He himself added that he has posted on Facebook only a few times in the past few years and never let his children use it. He is not the only whistleblower on Facebook. Sean Parker, Facebook's early investor, co-founder and music sharing site Napster, said last month that "" I have become a conscientious opponent in social media, and with Facebook and social media coverage, I have been able to identify and exploit weaknesses in humans. "" Antonio Garcia Martinez, former product manager at Facebook, also wrote a book titled "" Chaos Monkey > "" and accused Facebook of lying about its ability to collect data and affect individuals. Facebook has repeatedly said that "" making the world more open and connected "" is its corporate goal, but it is a major source of disgust and disgust on the stage after the fake news and Russian ads were left unattended in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. As accusations and criticism grew, Facebook acknowledged its partial responsibility. Facebook posted a public blog on its 15th, ' Difficult Questions : Is It Bad to Spend Time Using Social Media? 'Ran the article Facebook reported in its article published in the Journal of the American Dynamics, that the physical and mental health of those who "" liked it "" more than typical Facebook users. "" Manual consumption patterns of scrolling down to make updates without deep interaction with others can be more unhealthy, "" he said. Facebook's comments were seen as a direct affront to the reason for its existence, according to The New York Times. "" No Privacy "" - Facebook's fake news did not affect the actual presidential election, "" said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who recently acknowledged Facebook's justification and looked down on a series of criticisms. In a quarterly earnings statement last month, Zuckerberg apologized for Facebook's impact in the presidential election and said that although the profits were falling, healthy communities would be put first.

"Q : Unlike China's status as the world's largest manufacturer of Christmas trees, many regions have recently banned the Christmas festival, and many regions have reportedly been busy with the "" Battle of Christmas "" news on July 24. The newspaper quoted an article posted on the Chinese version of Twitter, Weibo, and told students at the University of Southern China's University's University of Hong Kong, "" Communist Youth League of the Communist Party of China. "" "" Communist Party members should be role models in following the Communist faith, "" the panel said in a statement, "" We can not accept the blind adherence to Western principles such as superstitions and opium. "" The panel also added a warning that it would face sanctions if it is confirmed that members or their immediate family attended religious events on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. In addition, he also asked us to actively participate in events that promote patriotic and traditional Chinese culture. A university in Jiangsu, China banned it and provoked controversy. President Xi Jinping, who was appointed as head of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, began an event aimed at preventing Western culture from re-fusioning China at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in October. Earlier, China's official Global Times reported that the University of Shenyang University in Liaoning Province banned Christmas and other Christian-related events to inspire cultural pride. The second town of Huanyang banned members from holding religious events, while the general public from gathering on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, according to reports. However, the situation is quite different as merchants are starting to show off Christmas trees and decorations to open their wallets on Christmas presents despite government regulations. Market research group China Skinny said more than 600,000 Christmas trees and 3 million decorations were sold at T Mall in Alibaba this year alone. The T Mall is known to still display 20,000 Christmas products. An expert at southern Guangdong province's Castle Shenzhen said, ' It is ironic that frontline institutions called Christmas events a "" Western festival, "" and stressed a re-political view of Chinese culture. He then attributed the revision to the Chinese State Council Act, which goes into effect next February, to have encouraged regulations on religion-related events.Beijing Avenue [AP = Yonhap News] kky@yna.co.kr with a brilliant flash in the eye.

Lee Ho-won (28) and Lee Chang-soo (62), acting as agents, run the streets at night to endure the last words of drunken men and the cold. They have a dream of becoming an actress and aim to feed their families. The year-end gathering was closely followed by the two most active stations in Gangnam and Hapjeong. ■ Even on days of low - 13 degrees, or maybe even dying, "" the hiking boots dug deeply as I walked through the snow in my boots. Lee Ho-won (28) lost his claw while working on the stage. He is an aspiring actress and an acting engineer. My toes were sore, but I walked like a run. "" Yes, I expect to arrive seven minutes from now. Please wait a minute. "" He is afraid that the client will cancel as a substitute in the middle. I sold my electric wheels secondhand to pay for acting lessons. Now I have to run. When carols blared out at 11:00 p.m. at Kangnam station in Seoul, the drunken man staggered. Between the man who fell down and the policeman who raises him up, he focused on the tip of his hand. To ensure you don't miss the call of an agent called Cole. When the call comes up, it is the man who presses the call quickly. For a year's end, one second is a dollar for a proxy engineer. Anyone who wears fadding and gloves on one hand at Gangnam Station is a substitute, said Howon, but he is a bare hand despite the biting wind. If you press the smartphone with your gloves on, you will experience a slower recognition. `` It's 0.2 seconds. This is not something you can think about complicated people. It should be simple. Calls to the town centre are popular. This is because the waiting time is running out due to the large number of requests made by proxy. The key to catching a good call is to be able to tell the neighborhood and the fare by making fun of your fingers. `` We need to identify areas with many calls.

"▽ Mail to Mail immediately after the payment account transfer = Most of the items purchased for re-approving, self-defeating, and fake official documents are accepted as fake report cards. For only 10,000 won, it was possible to create a report card with the academic records of the Korean curriculum. Dozens of articles on the Internet, such as used trading cafes and mobile applications, have been posted to sell SAT or mock tests. Other blogs say that if you send a pin number that enables you to write a cultural gift certificate online, you can send a form in the report card of middle and high school.View of the sales of CSAT report card form in mobile second-hand transaction application. When actual transaction occurs, I contacted the seller by text message and sent money via account transfer and only received the report card in Korean (. hwp) Although the prices of the dishes differ slightly from seller to seller, they were 10,000 to 30,000 won per day. The reporter could buy the form of the CSAT for 10,000 won and the National Evaluation Institute of Education for the combined academic performance by 30,000 won. It was hard to distinguish fake CSAT scores from actual ones unless they were carefully screened using purchased forms. The curriculum evaluation institute's logo and the principal's seal were inserted into an image file in the same location, and the description of the standard scores and percentiles were written in minute letters. The academic performance test results were indistinguishable from the fake one. The fake CSAT results could have been fake because the academic curriculum evaluation ledger was subtly awkward, but the academic records without the seals were nowhere to be found. It is estimated that fake report card deals are mostly intended to show the results to parents. Although not satisfactory in the CSAT or mock tests, parents are said to have cheated and were allowed to repeat the exam because of their higher grades. In some cases, they even make fake reports to show off their social networking sites. You can easily think of forgery on your CSAT and pay dearly. This is because they can be apologized for forgery of official documents and the provision of official documents to the committee. In fact, he wanted to go to Seoul National University in 2015, and when he spread false information that a large number of high school scorers would support him, he was suspected of posting a fake report card on the online community.

"Missing from the time of death - latest analysis on records … no sign of deletion. According to North Jeolla Province police on July 24, a car was confiscated by aunt Junhee Yang (36) and her aunt (35 and female), and her mother Kim (61 and 12). The police are investigating the three computers and cellular phones with digital forensics (Analysis of the information on the digital storage medium). Police recently checked her cell phone records, text messages and Internet searches between July 18, when she was presumed missing, but found no clues. Police explained that during this time, Ko, Yi and Kim did not contact each other for any strange reason.Ko and Yi had contacted each other once on July 4 as a matter of separation and no further contact. Police also added that no trace of the call or the deletion of text messages was found. Police will review the digital media from late last month to July 18th, and look at previous records. It is hard to say whether she has any clues missing, as she is still analyzing her cell phone and computer, said Kim Yeon-keun, head of the prosecutor`s investigation team. Junhee Lee's mother disappeared from a house in Deokjin-dong, Jeonju while her mother Kim was absent from her home on July 18. Lee said, I did not report it to the police because I felt my separated father had taken it with me, and requested an investigation on July 8. doo@yna.co.kr and inquiry by the press (Click!). Han Moo-seon (Click!)

About 200 people, including 2017.12.24mshan@yna.co.kr bereaved family members and Daegu Police Agency chief Lee Joon-seop, Public Administration and Security Minister Kim Bu-kyeum, National Assembly Member of Joo Ho-young and Yoon Jae-ok, and Daegu Mayor Kwon Young-jin attended. After issuing a silent prayer and a report on her life, Minister Kim received a posthumous award of the Okjo Geunjeong. Lee instinctively realizes that the situation is dangerous at the moment, but his body responds to the call of the public before his head. I love police, "" Jeong said in a farewell speech. I will remember you forever in front of the mountain and history. Jeong's mother, wife, and mother's crying look made the funeral attendants feel more engrossing. After the ceremony, the Ungu vehicle went to Daegu Hamyang Park before heading to the National Cemetery in Daejeon. Jeong Yeon-ho, a sergeant at the Daegu Police Agency, reported on July 21 in a report to a colleague who had bought a bonfire for his son and tried to kill him, but later reported to a fellow police officer, "" Please block me. "" Police believed Jeong sacrificed himself to save a civilian's life and gave him a first-class reward. mshan@yna.co.krBereaved families of sports center victims briefed Monday afternoon an inspection tour at the Jecheon-che gym in North Chungcheong Province. According to news1 of news, July 23, 2001, the bereaved families of the victims conducted a joint investigation at the Jecheonchee National Briefing Center to commemorate the souls of the victims of the tragedy.At 3:00 p.m., police, the National Institute of Scientific Investigation, and the Jecheon City Hall took a look at the scene for an hour. After examining the ceiling of the first floor, which was designated as the source of ignition, the bereaved first followed the entire sports center building with a staircase and a bath for women on the second floor.After the visit, the bereaved family bowed and left the building with a heavy look on their heads. Since then, I have been puzzled over whether the inside of the building has been properly investigated (the cause of the fire, etc.), saying the official.At the briefing, the bereaved family claimed, "" The second floor of the building with the highest number of deaths (20) was almost completely unburned, and many more would have been saved if the exit had been secured. ""They also complained that the exit doors were hidden by washrooms, and the sliding doors on the main entrance door were not working properly.The sauna on the second floor, where the bodies of 20 of the 29 victims were found, was the closest to the firing point on the first floor of the pilotis structure (an open structure with only pillars installed). When the fire broke out on July 21, 15 cars were parked on the first floor of the building, and entrance to the sauna was provided. The fire department also explained that the gate was the inlet for smoke and toxic gas from vehicles.The bereaved also repeated their previous argument, saying, "" If we broke into the second floor quicker, we could have reduced the damage by breaking through windows. "" However, he pointed out the problems of the disaster response system.One family member said, We don`t want to punish anyone. No matter how much I talk, I don`t think (my loved ones) will come back alive, said the message is, I ask you to make a good manual to make sure it doesn't happen again."" I don't want to punish many firefighters or police officers who have really struggled, "" he said.""

"② As small investors repeatedly showed signs of "" Whales, "" frequent panic over the lack of safety devices in the exchange market and high price fluctuations occurred. As a result, four cipher, money investment risks were reintroduced due to the fear of investors. Experts point out that the underlying instability in the cryptocracker market, such as the lack of exact information and the overwhelming influence of minority holders, has boosted the price range.It is impossible to judge whether the money market is high or low, and it is difficult to determine whether it is high or low. Lee Dae-ki, an economist at the Korea Institute of Finance, diagnosed that, "" Bit-coins are not bubbles because they can not calculate the appropriate value, and their price is being determined by variables that can not be identified. "" `` Any time demand turns off, whether it be the national regulations or the advent of a new cipher suite, it can crash, '' he warned. In reality, many in the cryptophony market forecast that the "" Santa Rally "" would start on the last day of regular trading on the Christmas Eve. The Santa Rally is a stock-market rally that starts before Christmas and lasts until January. This is the phenomenon of domestic demand picking up in the process of exchanging Christmas gifts and year-end bonuses in the stock market. This year, it seemed that the main character would not be a stock but would be an encryption device such as Bitcone. But the reality was the exact opposite. According to the coin Market Cab, a cipher firm, the market capitalization of the cipher currency decreased to $ 426.4 billion from $ 614.3 billion on July 22. In other words, one third of the money disappeared from the market in one day. The main reason for the repeat of such a sudden registration is the lack of information. Investors can hardly determine which currency to invest in with clear information. Companies can identify strong companies through disclosure, but they are not even identified by their developers in cipher. There are 1378 encrypted units on the market on July 24, and dozens of coins are generated and disappear each day. A high school student, identified as "" A, "" posted a fake article as a developer of the new encryption loser, Bitcone platinum, collecting investors and earning a profit. The actual profit from the market was only 3 million won, but the ensuing storm was huge. It is because there is room for someone to imitate the similar scheme. We will disclose evaluation information and data in the coming months on the listing of the market for the new password coins, said Kim Jin-hwa, head of the Korean Association of Block Chain`s Information and Communication, as many times as possible.Another problem is that the market is controlled by a small number of forces. In the cryptomoney industry, large investors are referred to as ' whales. ' Mathematically, 1000 whales massage about 100 trillion won in stock. Most whales either went into the early days of Bitcone mining or started their initial investment. They have so much stuff in store that they could face a sharp decline in prices if they sell it for a few. "" Beatcoin is not a securities, so we can not stop some powers from colluding and making huge profits, "" said Gary Ross, a finance lawyer. "" Because the blind investor can only tell what is plan and intention. ""The fact that there is no safety device to prevent a sudden fall in the price range increases. In the stock market, circuit breaker is activated when stock prices go up or down. It is to temporarily suspend the market in case of sudden price fluctuations and to allow time for rational judgment. However, the encrypted currency market can not stop. When the drop rapidly increases, a distress cell causes dumping, causing massive losses. "" We need to establish sound market order through institutional arrangements, and at the moment we have no basis for setting up other alternatives, and we have no one to deal with them, "" Kim said.Frequent computer disruptions and hacking on the stock exchange are also adding to investor anxiety. The Cryptocode Exchange's website announced on July 19 that it would suspend all crypto-money and cash-based payments and begin bankruptcy because of hacking. Prior to this, Bitshomb's personal information leakage occurred in June and Yapizone hacking happened in April. Amid the growing gap between the Korean and overseas exchanges, the price gap between the Korean and overseas exchanges is growing, creating jitters in the market. When the BitTechnett exchange sold the bill for $ 14,433 (about 14,520,000 won), it was trading at a higher price than the Bit-Pinex exchange at 3:00 p.m. on July 24. (Classroom) I don't even remember what I saw when I saw the stories in my head because I played different videos for every teacher I came in for. "" "" Even for parents of Seoul B Middle School, I feel frustrated. I saw that it would be nice to go to the play park as a group to study in the field. So I would like to go to the classroom on a cold day, attend, and go to the karaoke room or PC room during the winter vacation. Teachers complain that it is difficult to conduct the curriculum after finishing the final exams in early December, but it is hard to shorten the semester to fill the number of classes.Parents of H High School (Gangseo District) said on July 13, I don`t know if it is the third year of high school I took, and I don`t know why the remaining first or second grade students have to take such a long class.One junior high school student (Gimje, North Jeolla Province) said, "" If I play a movie during class, I only watch one or two people. The rest of the students sleep on their stomach. "" But, "" Even the teacher has to take regular classes on their back. "" Teachers are also dissatisfied with the management of such schools. One teacher in S-drught, Incheon, said, "" After the final exams, the students don't seem to be paying attention at all. "" "" I don't think it's going to mean I should release some stressed students, but it doesn't mean I should have any grades. ""Some schools have adopted separate programs that allow students to participate freely, such as theatrical performances and discussion classes, but the programs have not been widely distributed. As a result, some say, "" We should reduce the number of school days compared to other countries.""The OECD's Education Indicators show that the average number of school days for elementary, middle and high schools in Korea was 181 days on average as of early 2015. "" I have to fill the class days set by the current elementary, middle, and high school seniors during the spring semester, "" said a teacher. "" If I want to get into school and take the final exams before the end of November or December, I have to complete the final exams. ""Another middle school teacher (Seongdong-gu, Seoul) said, "" Referring the final exam and speeding up the commencement ceremony as much as possible is not going to minimize the meaningless number of days to go to school, but change the law entirely to reflect it. "" Good teacher, campaign policy director Kim Young-sik, said, As I can`t get out of the academic curriculum that aims to test, I felt that after the tests were over, neither students nor teachers had anything to do.Cho In-kyung, reporter of Yang-Nak Gyu's "" Military Story "" ikjo@asiae.co.kr"
"The international community goes to North Korea every time North Korea invalids, not China, to be attacked, but it is useless if China does not actively participate in the smuggling. China can not deviate from the international community's concerted actions because it has the dignity of being a great power, but China's role of pressuring the North is just that long. North Korea is also aware of this reality. We have closely watched China's sanctions against North Korea, which are not on the outside.The sun rises above the Aprok River bridge and the Sinuiju factory seen from nearby China on March 6, 2016. [Nusis] After being quiet for some time early in the morning on November 29, 2017, North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICP-15). The missile is more than 50 minutes flight after Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone (eez) dropped to my donghae. This is the 11th after the launch of Moon Jae-in government missile provocation and an intermediate-range ballistic missile on September 15 (irbm) ‘Mars - Type 12’ 75 days since launch. North Korea insisted on completing its nuclear weapons program, saying it could install a very large, heavyweight nuclear warhead that could strike the entire U.S. mainland after launching ICBMs. U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said, We have reached an altitude higher than any other missile in the past, concerned North Korea that it is trying to build a missile that could threaten anywhere in the world. NIS Director Seo Hoon also commented, We are the most advanced missile North Korea has ever launched. The ' Hwasong-15 ' caused the United States to overrun. United States president is Donald Trump, Xi Jinping (習近平) Kim Jong Un, and demanded ‘North Korea halt oil supplies’ to Chinese ‘a sick dog (sick puppy)’ ‘, Little.Rokenmaen ’ and his anger. The U.S. leadership is often referred to as a possible preemptive strike against the North again. 2017 was a time when the international community's sanctions on North Korea were concentrated than ever. The U.N. Security Council has adopted a resolution to impose sanctions on North Korea three times, and the Chinese government has responded to it and has strongly supported the sanctions. However, North Korea launched its sixth nuclear test in September 2017 and then went to the highest level of ICBMs ever. The international community's move to stop North Korea's armed provocation by sanctions has not been achieved.North Korean cargo is moving into China after customs clearance was placed in Dandong, China on March 2, 2016. [Nusis] That does not mean that sanctions against North Korea are not effective. The North Korean project, which has been under way for some time, was hit hard. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on December 8 that the joint venture of North Korea and Swiss companies, Fance Pharmaceutical Company, was forced to close in the aftermath of U.N. Security Council sanctions. Pyeongs Pharmaceutical Company, created over 10 years ago by a joint venture between a Swiss company and Pyongyang Pharmaceutical Company under the Ministry of Health and Welfare, produces and sells basic medicines such as painkillers and antibiotics in North Korea. As the Security Council banned joint projects with North Korea in its Security Council Resolution 2375 adopted in September, the commission said the restriction would have to be closed unless the Security Council approves of exceptions. China, dubbed as the "" post-North Korea's spy country, "" has a much easier way to detect the fallout of sanctions on North Korea. In Jilin Province, the most active trading destination for North Korea, North Korean businessmen could complain about the return parade of illegally employed North Korean workers, while they were called on the verge of collapse. Furthermore, demands have been continuously transmitted to Chinese businessmen to use North Korean laborers, who are playing on sanctions. The influence of sanctions has also affected the clandestine North Korean hackers in China. Sources say that North Korean hackers in Liaoning Province quickly withdrew from China in October while pressure was on all sides. North Korean hackers reportedly withdrew because they received many reports of suspicious acts after China's sanctions were shown. In the past, officials of the Dalian Public Security Bureau, which had ties with hacker teams, would have been able to make a quick escape before the crackdown, but Beijing officially explained the sanctions to Beijing. However, others say that sanctions against the North are a matter of national concern. As time goes by, sanctions are becoming nominal. For business owners who are so called ' energetic ' and ' rich ', sanctions on North Korea are rather an opportunity to make money. Among them, the North Korean business is always called ' Palace is the King's ransom '. Chinese news sources have reported on various ways to avoid sanctions.A train loaded with containers is running on the Trans-Siberian Railway (TSR) connecting Vladivostok to Moscow in the washed, Russian city of Hassan, where it was originally born as a "" label plowing. "" [Park Young-dae, a reporter at Donga Ilbo] W is a Chinese assistant who runs a large-scale sewing factory in Sinuiju. It owns a 20-ton small fishing boat and is accompanied by a marine products business. However, the sanctions that began in 2017 were enough to make W thrilled. That is because the fishing boats are making handsome profits by converting their uses to smuggling. As China joined in imposing sanctions on North Korea and blocked the entry of goods from Dandong, business owners began searching for smuggled fishing boats. After seeing the incident, W actively exploited her fishing boat to smuggle it. In Sinuiju, not only his own sewing factories, but also nearby factories ' products are being shipped to China. As the smuggling costs were calculated by the price of each suit, it would be like making money sitting down. As businessmen cried out for the best delivery date, W tore off the boat's roofs to put on more luggage. The sanctions against North Korea against W was once a crisis, but were soon an opportunity. As such, most of the owners of smuggled fishing boats from North Korea to China are reportedly in debt. As a way to avoid sanctions against North Korea, smuggling of sea water is not the only way. There is also a normal way of getting through customs. I told The Weekly Dong-A 1102 in August 2017 that China refused to approve customs clearance of Bukhansan products labeled ` Made in China ` on July 30, a few days before it adopted a resolution to impose sanctions on North Korea. Meanwhile, the North Korea and China Border Customs did not impose a crackdown on products that came out with the label "" Made in China, "" but they suddenly started to stop using the Security Council resolution. But, again, the palace is called Gung-il-gal. After labeling North Korea's factory products "" Made in North Korea, "" the products pass through the Chinese customs office and then change their labels to "" Made in China "" in a bonded warehouse. As such, the ' label plowing ' Bukhansan that is made in China is sold to South Korea, Japan, the United States and Europe. Many of them are brand names. In the past, ' labels gratting ' was not necessary. If the truck loaded with boxes filled with complete North Korean products and put them down at Dandong Customs, the boxes would go to the export port by truck. That is, the Chinese government blocked the export of Bukhansan products by blocking the cars, and one more troublesome process was added to this process called "" label replacement. "" As a result, the products of Bukhansan are sold around the world in the same way.As part of a measure to reinforce sanctions against North Korea, the Chinese government ordered Chinese military to replace its customs officials by saying it would eradicate illegal trade with China beginning in mid-September 2017. The armed forces of the armed forces of the armed forces of the armed forces of the armed forces against the North were required to take charge of customs in the border area of North Korea and China, including Hunchun Qianhe Customs. The immediate effect has stopped the trading of products subject to sanctions. But it was just ' for a while '. As time went by, the old, illicit and illicit transactions began again. The competent businessmen successfully cleaned out the Bukhansan products. Instead, the cost of giving a back shot is higher than in the past. Local sources say the products of Bukhansan continue to flow to China. Hunchun avoids sanctions against North Korea by taking advantage of the geographical features that North Korea, China and Russia encounter. North Korea's special spiral region, Russia's Hassan and China's Hunchun Route are examples. Goods were shipped to and from the special zone in the past, but were shipped via Russia's Hassan to avoid sanctions. Sources say that it is not hard to witness a large Russian truck parade loaded with Bukhansan products near the river. The Russian acts more illegally than the Chinese, sources say. You can pass anything you can to the border customs officer. If we open up the cargo compartment for the North, we will see a flood of surprises, including various weapons. Foreign news reports are being reported to support the source's message. AFP reported on December 4, 2017 that North Korea avoided sanctions on its coal exports by the United Nations Security Council via RasonConTrans, a joint venture between North Korea and Russia. The train, carrying two million tons of Russian coal, arrives at the dock at Rajin Port, operated by Naseonkon Trans, and then transmits the coal to China, which includes Bukhansan coal. AFP reported that after China announced that it would suspend North Korea's import of coal, Naseonkon Trans's business is booming. German broadcaster Deutsche Belle said on Dec. 5, The price of North Korean oil products began to fall in November after months of price fluctuations. Citing a report by a civic journalist in North Korea that Japan's Asia Press International (API) has secured, the network said there is a huge fuel flow through the Russian border, prompting an U.S.-led international arms embargo. Earlier, CNBC in the United States said on November 26, 2017, "" The United States has redistributed North Korea as a sponsor of terrorism and the international community strengthened sanctions against the North, but North Korea still has a significant presence in the hands of many other foreign exchange channels. ""North Korea launched its intercontinental ballistic missile, the Hwasung-15, on November 29, 2017. North Korea in the midst of this"
"Russia and Korea are closely watching each other. Russia's Vice Foreign Minister Lia NovostI told a forum in Berlin on December 5 that Russia's foreign minister, Igor Morgulov, said, Pyongyang wants U.S. guarantees, not Russian or Chinese guarantees. North Korea wants to have direct talks with the United States, the report said.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also reiterated, "" North Korea has repeatedly told Russia that it needs to guarantee U.S. security. ""Morgulov said in early December, referring to massive combined air drills between Korea and the United States, It is aggravating the situation in the region and it is not inviting the North to dialogue. Regarding the North Korea`s bid to launch Hwasong-15, it also openly sided with the communist state, saying it was only in response to the U.S.-backed militant actions on the Korean Peninsula. Morgulov also said North Korea showed an interest in the roadmap, a peaceful and step-by-step approach proposed by Russia and China to solve the Korean Peninsula. The China-Russia Roadmap includes three phases of implementation. In the first stage, the two countries also reduce or stop joint drills when North Korea announces a halt to further tests of its nuclear and pledges to dismantle its nuclear and ballistic missiles. In the second phase, the armistice agreement on the Korean Peninsula will be replaced by a peace treaty. In the third stage, they will discuss denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia's security system through multilateral agreements.  North Korea`s state-run Korean Central News Agency reported on December 6 that North Korea and Russia signed a treaty on free rein delivery in Moscow on Dec. 5. It is interpreted that the treaty would transfer prisoners who are serving time in the other country to their home countries. This is November 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructs the Russian president will sign a ‘Convention on Transfer of Sentenced Persons’ with North Korea seems to have to.Without China's participation, Beijing might not know that useless North Korean businessmen avoid sanctions in various ways, including by "" plowing the label. "" I know well, but I think I'm being a stranger. China is known to support sanctions but actually give the North a break. Actually, it is no business to root out illegal North Korean and Chinese deals if Beijing wants to. That is because there is a huge amount of public power available. The contraband fishing boats should be kept on every point of entry, and more Chinese soldiers should be sent to customs officials to search the vessel's products. The Russian government should also use its government power to check trucks traveling to and from Hassan, Russia, in an indirect transaction. "" Label grinding "" is easily resolved by a raid on the work site. There are many cases in which the Chinese government has made relentless efforts to mobilize governmental power to achieve its goals when it intends to raise a number of basic issues. However, China will never go so far when it comes to North Korea. They believe the North Korean blockade is only good for the United States, which shakes its stability greatly and dreams of keeping its supremacy in the Asia-Pacific region. It is to be taken into consideration. Whenever North Korea invalids, the international community decides to take sanctions. But international sanctions on North Korea are virtually useless without China's active support. China can not deviate from the international community's concerted actions because it is a face-saving power of the world's Big 2. However, this is the role of pressuring China toward North Korea. Not anymore. North Korea is also aware of this reality. China picks up knives at crucial moments, so sanctions against North Korea and North Korea's armed provocation go round and round and round. Whether or not China knows about this, the United States has continued to emphasize China's role in North Korea.It is South Korea that is the first to be attacked, but now more and more people in the United States are skeptical of China`s role in North Korea. `` China has lied for 25 years in an Associated Press interview saying China wants North Korea to remove its nuclear weapons program, '' Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican, who is considered the next CIA director. `` Actually, China is benefiting from North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons, '' Cotton`s Rep. Cotton said, `` but has done nothing to stop the North's efforts to possess nuclear weapons while publicly saying anything to the West. '' Amid this, news reports on China's stance on the North Korean nuclear issue appeared. `` If there is a war on the Korean Peninsula, it is the first time for North Korea to take an attack, '' the Chinese daily People's Daily, the Communist Party's Daily, said on December 6, 2017. The interview was made possible by an article titled "" Nuclear Weapons Generalizes and Response Methods, "" in which the Jilin Ilbo, the official news agency of China's Jilin Province, featured one page. The Jilin Ilbo, which introduced nuclear weapons in detail, detailed descriptions of responses to the exposed nuclear weapons along with illustrations. The North Korean border area of the Jilin province is the most sensitive to North Korea`s nuclear test, about 100 kilometers from Punggye-ri nuclear test site. Fears grew among Chinese Internet users over whether the government's official news agency might publish such articles because of the possible war on the Korean Peninsula. As people are agitated, Chinese authorities are evolving, and the Chinese government will join us.He posted an urgent editorial under the theme of '. The China Times stressed that the Jilin Ilbo special news report introduces general drills in other countries. It is more likely that China would be directly affected by the war than that. We can not rule out the possibility of nuclear contamination due to the Korean Peninsula war, but now it is winter in the northwest, which gives us an advantage over northeastern China, he said. Though the Chinese official is highly criticized by foreign media in provocative and suggestive terms, there are cases when Chinese authorities freely disclose their inner thoughts on behalf of China, which they can not publicly disclose. As the controversy grew, the Times finally deleted the editorial in question the following day.Shortly after the scandal erupted over the return of workers to China, reports showed that the Chinese government is planning to build a refugee camp near North Korea. China`s state-run news agency, China Central News Agency, and others, reported that the Chinese government is pushing to build five refugee camps in Jilin Province. We don`t have any plans to build refugee camps, and we have never heard of such documents, the RFA said. The documents were distributed on the Chinese Internet, but all of them were deleted. It is a clear evidence that the recent state of the Korean Peninsula's initial state of tension is clearly affecting neighboring China as well. No North Korean workers were allowed to return home until the end of 2017. North Korea`s special media in late October and early November and the Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun reported that North Korea ordered its workers in China to return home by the end of 2017. In a December 2017 issue, I said in a statement to Shindongah that although North Korea`s directive has been directed to Chinese employers, I don`t think it will be fulfilled locally. Local expectations were correct. After visiting Pyongyang in late November, a Chinese businessman said, There is no reason for North Korean workers working in China to return home. It is not like that at all, '' he said. As of mid-December, many North Korean workers were confirmed to have continued their work in Dandong, Truman, Hunchun and Dalian without preparations to return. North Korea, like China, has a gap between its tough talk on China and actual actions.Kim Seung-jae, YTN correspondent and former Beijing correspondent, sjkim@ytn.co.kr Magazine Donga"
