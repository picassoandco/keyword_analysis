After their children played the fool, their parents apologized and compensated for their losses.Parents will pay a huge sum of money for their teenagers ' immature pranks.According to a Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun report on July 18, two 19-year-old teenagers who threw bath bubbles in the hot springs were arrested by police for interfering with their work.The two teenagers allegedly blocked business by putting eight bath utensils in a spa while using the hot spring in Wakayama Prefecture, Japan.Students admitted all of the charges in a police investigation, calling it a "" fun game. ""Meanwhile, it is reported that parents will compensate for losses due to big damages, such as a three-day suspension of hot spring business due to childish mischief by students.Lee Dong-jun, a reporter at blondie@segye.com captured by the Asahi Shimbun, and found that during the design process of the Global Media World Daily, the result of the collapse of the construction method … and restoration of the construction method was carried out by temporary workers at less than 80 percent in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province last August. In particular, design flaws were discovered to have existed in the first place. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport explains that this requires the construction of a new method using a different method.The International High History Committee of Construction in Pyeongtaek, Ministry of Land, Transport and Transportation (Accident Investigation Committee Chairman and Professor Kim Sang-hyo of Yonsei University) announced on August 17 the results of an investigation into the collapse of Pyongtaek International Bridge on August 26 last year. The accident occurred when four pagodas (240 meters long) installed at the foot of the international bridge were collapsed and lowered to the floor 20 meters below. Pyeongtaek-dong International Bridge is 1.3 kilometers long and four lanes long, which is part of the transaxial road between Pyeongtaekho Lake and Poseung-eup, Pyeongtaek-si. With all the bridges installed, the top of the bridge was being placed on. There were no casualties besides the bridge collapse.The bridge was built on land in advance and applied an ‘ ILM and Incremental Launching Method ’, which uses hydraulic jacks to push the upper part over the piers and fix it. It is a common method used by contractors to construct bridges in Korea. It is the first time that a collapse accident has occurred in a bridge construction with ILM method applied.The accident committee first pointed out the design flaws. "" We had no problem when reviewing the strength of the upper girder (upper plate) against the type of force intended to be cut off. "" It is also difficult to construct reinforcing bars because the wall is thin where the steel lines are placed, he added. Construction specifications were omitted from the extrusion process that is the core process of umbrella construction. And construction was not properly reviewed before such design defect entered the construction.Construction work was also problematic. Processing the upper wall joints and mating faces was insufficient, and reinforcing bars were used that did not satisfy the specifications provided by the company that made and delivered the settlements, the committee explained. In some cases, different types of wall reinforcement were built than the construction detail drawings. "" There were also many repair work, such as the area around the anchorage being broken and steel wires pulled out during construction, and it was estimated to have been partially damaged by an accident committee that was not clearly identified during this process. "" Various problems occurred during the construction due to faulty design, which meant that the construction was carried out by fixing it.The accident committee pointed out that the supervision process was also problematic. "" Most construction and quality staff, including site agents, were on-site rather than full-time, "" explained the site manager, "" and it was the responsibility of the site administration to be vulnerable. "" Only 76 percent of subcontractors paid out of the bid amount, but they pretended to have paid the amount of overhead out of the calculations and made it look like 84 percent.The accident committee estimated that a chain reaction occurred, such as the adjacent tops bending or collapsing after the top of the P16 site was broken.Because of the design flaws, we will have to construct them using other construction methods, said an official at the ministry. They have to rebuild the building entirely, starting with the design. The progress rate of road two on the road across Pyongtaek was 58.7 % and was scheduled to be completed by the end of 2018. Construction of Pyongtaek International Bridge at the base will also delay the completion drastically.[Jo GwI-dong, a reporter, cao@chosunbiz.com]chosunbiz.com tried to get on the plane and bundled up against anything that did not fit into the carrier when baggage standards were exceeded.The British daily Telegraph arrived on two separate reports on its flight Thursday when Ryan Hawaii flew to Britain from Keplavik Airport in Iceland.On July 10, Ryan found that not all of her clothes were in the carrier before her flight to Britain.In order to comply with the baggage weight rule, he tried to board the plane with all 18 of the remaining pants, top 10 shirts and suits in full.However, the airline warned Ryan that she could not get on the plane with the clothes bundled up.

""" When I woke up from work, my return was minus 50 percent. "" "" All my loans and investments went out of bed in the morning, "" said an economist. Since the night before, the price of virtual currency, including Bitcone, has decreased en masse. These deplorable articles appeared in the virtual call-related Internet community and Kakao Talk chat room. Most of all, I was curious to know why it fell so much. Analysts say the expiration date of the U.S. Bitcone futures market is the reason, and many say it is due to the "" fear transfer. "" Last night, the reason for the virtual currency crash was that virtual currencies crashed en masse. Bitcone plunged from 569,000 won per line to 6:129,000 won the following day. At the same time, the ripple of other virtual currencies dropped from 2,475 to 1,120 won. Bitcone started to fall on July 16 and has flattened the virtual currency market. Industry watchers said, We led the decline in the United States. With the collapse of $ 10,000 in Bitcone, investor sentiment has been at a loss, said Kang Jae-kyung, an economist at Samsung Securities Co. Investors chose China as the main reason for the decline, along with the U.S. futures market. Analysts say the Chinese government has shocked the market by tightening regulations on mining and blocking P2P transactions. Chinese investors are now trading with P2P platforms with their exchanges closed. As the investment method disappeared, some mining companies and investors who were dealing with outside of the market threw coins and led the decline. Some analyze that it is because the U.S. Bitcone futures expire. The expiration dates for the Bitcone futures listed on the Chicago Options Exchange (CBOE) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CME) are 17 and 26, respectively, local time. As investors poured out their sales to pay their bills before the due date, futures prices plummeted, which led to lower spot prices. A futures investment is a selection of products that promises to be purchased and sold at predetermined prices on a specific date (due date). Trading at CBOE was suspended the other day when the price of Bitcone dropped 20 percent.● Experts say, "" Slow recovery "", but they agree that it is difficult to find a clear cause. Investors ' sentiment has collapsed. Korean investors sold their products in the morning of July 17 after the U.S. market led the plunge on July 16. They say that if they exchange fears, they can lead to a collapse without any clear reason. Choi Chang-kyu, an economist at NH Investment & Securities Co., said, We should collect the actual amount of cash in a month by buying and selling Bitcons and trading profits simultaneously. The impact on the maturity of futures may not be significant because of the lack of supplies, said Kim Jae-kyung, director of the state-run Korea Investment and Securities Co. As of 2:00 p.m. July 17, most virtual currencies remain 20 to 30 percent lower than the previous day. Experts note that the rebound is taking longer than in the past. Choi said, Some investors have left the government's restriction, and the market pie has shrunk due to the new inflow of investors. As a result, it may take a long time to recover the market. Some analyze that the process will allow healthy markets to form when bubbles disappear. With only long-term investors remaining, the fluctuations in virtual currencies should be reduced, said an official at the Korea Stock Exchange, in a comment that was negative in the past, even in U.S. financial circles, agreeing on the importance of block chains and virtual currencies. I regret last year`s comments to buy Bitcone, said Jamie Dieman, chairman of JP Morgan recently. Kim Seong-mo, reporter of The Dong-A Ilbo, official Facebook and Dong-A Ilbo, and the "" Hot Economic Issues "" and "" Retech Method are all set up "" (clicked), and the "" Dong-A Ilbo & Donga.com, Unauthorized and Redistributions. "" According to CNBC, the price of Bitcone dropped to $ 969.9 in the morning (Korean Time) of July 17 at Coinbase, one of the largest virtual currency exchanges in the world. The CNBC analyzed that the drop of 28 percent in just one day was due to the increase in sales when the Korean government announced that it would tighten regulations on virtual currency transactions. But he soon recovers $ 10,000 and as of 9:10, he is showing up at $ 11,790. Bloomberg's price of Bitcoin also decreased to $ 10,500 at 7:20 a.m. on July 17, down 27 percent from the previous day. Other virtual currencies also joined in. The bag plunged 30 percent to under $ 1,000, and this year's sparkly rising ripple plunged below $ 1, falling 46 percent. Neal Wilson, analyst at ETX Capital in Britain, said, It is clear that the Korean government is looking into banning virtual currency transactions, adding to this the overlapping news on China`s ban on virtual currency transactions, the price of news said directly. In the U.S., pressure on the stock exchange was felt. BitConnect announced yesterday that it would suspend virtual currency transactions because it received a warning from Texas and North Carolina authorities that it sold unapproved currency. Meanwhile, some research suggests that the increase in the price of Bitchin may have been manipulated by one person. Researchers at the University of Tel Aviv and the University of California at New York have published a report in the recent edition of the Journal of Monetary Economics that said that a single person could have raised the cost of a coin to $ 150 a possible fixed price in the Bitcone ecosystem.▶ newglass@yna.co.kr article 1:1 ▶ Pyeongchang Winter Olympics video contest to a news conference and report and your reporter Lee Myung-bak, the former president (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) hanjongchan the press.Lee Myung-bak, former president is 17, Samsung-dong, Gangnam-gu, said that the money of the prosecution in the office announce its position with regard to investigation, you touch your nose and looking at the hoegyeonmun. saba@yna.co.kr"" conservatives routed targeting political maneuvering and no political retaliation for the death former president ""Seoul (= = Lee Myung-bak (mb) former president has 17 press, Yonhap News Agency) ianseung"" with me.Cheong Wa Dae and the Lee Myung-bak administration officials who worked for the prosecution investigation began the first time, it is clear, said targeting me.

"I'll meet the Fair Trade Commission Chairman. In fact, last year, I started to stabilize chicken prices, pizza prices, and so on, but what are I paying attention to this year? In particular, the minimum wage increase is giving us complaining about the users. We will hear directly what the FTC sees. Let's connect with Kim Sang-jo, Fair Trade Commission Chairman. Good morning, Chairman Kim Sang-jo. How are you? ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > You have been in office for 6 months. It is seven months old. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > is also accurate, Director of Fair Trade Commission. How are you getting more fair in the eyes of Fair Trade Commission Chairman? Mr. Kim : Some expectations and demands of the people have become very high. We work hard to match that, but we are not yet satisfied with the people's sense of humor. Indeed, we will do our best to help the Fair Trade Commission achieve better results for the people's lives. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Actually, when I think of last year's Fair Trade Commission, I think of chicken first, chicken. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Really? Mr Kim : Our FTC does not serve as the government agency to determine the price of food or chicken. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : No, it is not. Mr Kim : But the prices were cut by the affiliated companies while investigating unfair business practices of the franchise business. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. So, you know, the price of chicken, the price of pizza, the fairness of the people's everyday lives last year, I think you paid attention to that.Mr Kim : I focused on the eradication of duplex. Chairman of Fair Trade Commission Kim Sang-jo (Photo = Data Photography) ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > So, what areas of fairness does this year's FTC notice? You can split it into three categories. The first was the president of New Year's but large business groups said in a news conference, improving governance of conglomerates and should make more efforts and results. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : The chaebol`s fairness. ◆m : Secondly, the relationship of these packs with sub-subsidiary distribution agencies will bear fruit in the measures already announced in the four major areas. Third, the FTC is actually the competition authority and is the competition recommendation body. In particular, I intend to focus on reforming our regulations and boosting the market competition to respond to the fourth industrial revolution in this field. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Among them, I would like to ask you a few questions about the biggest economic issue during the new year. As the minimum wage was 7530 won, it actually went up considerably compared to last year. Your total cost has risen by 7.4 %. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Small Business Partners, vendors, subcontractors, and self-employed people all make complaints now. It is difficult because of labor costs."" We interviewed one of the freighters a while ago, and he said, ' If you pay the piecework employees, you'll have to pay less for the work you don't have to pay the franchise store. ' What kind of measures, and what kind of measures, does the FTC see? The minimum wage. In particular, the minimum wage increase is a key policy to boost the incomes of the most difficult people in our society, and that's the key to revenue-led growth, going further to consumption. Of course, this will cost you. But it would be too much to handle if you let small businesses and small businessmen who hire those workers or part-time workers pay for that minimum wage increase. As a result, our FTC is now preparing measures to allow large companies, our franchise headquarters, and our distributors who do business with small businesses or small businesses to share the costs. Actually, we newly enacted and revised all our standard contracts through the revision of statutes in the area of franchise, distribution, and sub-contractor. The main idea is that when costs went up with a minimum wage increase, these contractors or retailers had the right to ask for and request for a rise in such a price, whether it's a delivery payment or some kind of price. When applying like this, the company or the affiliated company has established a policy to consult within a certain time frame. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Then, owners of store owners or subcontractors said, "" It is very difficult to pay for part-time jobs. Could you sign again at the office? Please lower the fees, raise the delivery price even more. ' If the franchise headquarters or big business asks ... ^ Kim Sang-jo > The headquarters of the member company or a large company made it mandatory to respond to the consultation. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > does not have to comply with all of them, but it must be agreed to first. Mr Kim : Yes, it is. Of course, this is a adjustment. The outcome depends on the negotiation, but if you apply, you must agree to the consultation. And individual small businesses or owners of stores can apply, but you can also apply through a cooperative or a business group. I hope that using these systems by many people this year will have a positive effect. ◇ What happens if you do not consult with Kim Hyun-jung >? Is there any disadvantage? It is a violation of the law. Our FTC has no choice but to step up. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > can not help accusing him?Although it may go to the prosecution, sanctions are applied. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > But what worries consumers is : ' If so, businesses will raise consumer prices. Maybe they will end up paying their customers the cost of a sub-contracting increase with higher wages. The price of the whole thing is also rising.' I've noticed such a movement recently in some restaurants. What do you think? Although the cost has gone up, it is difficult to keep the price. To make matters worse, it is not in line with the order of the market economy for a government ministry like the commission to push the price. As I mentioned earlier, I don't think employers or business stakeholders can afford to share the wage increase to the fullest and that shouldn't be reflected in our prices. However, through consultation with the stakeholders, we need to establish a system in which all costs can be shared. What I really want to make clear at this point is that the FTC doesn't go to any lengths to stabilize these prices. Let me make it clear that there are no such plans at the moment. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Then, consumers must be concerned. ' So you're saying that inflation is not involved after all? This is going up. Aren't we going up to the things we use right now?' I'm afraid I have these worries. Mr Kim : The government ministries have prepared comprehensive price policies. While macroeconomic prices are especially concerned by the Bank of Korea, various government agencies are working on ways to coordinate prices at micro-price. I would say earlier that no specific agency, such as the FTC, would intervene to control prices. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > FTC can not intervene in such matters, and I will correct the order. Although the arbitration award will be regulated, it should be decided in the market. "" ◇ By the way, Kim Hyun-jung > Chairman of the Committee, as the minimum wage increases, businesses with less than 30 employees receive support. Companies with a little higher than this standard, between 30 and 50 people, were having a hard time. If there is a complaint like this, is this still a minimum wage of 10,000 won?As for that point, I do not think it is an issue for the Fair Commissioner to officially answer. This part when it comes to pledges by the president, obviously. In this context, the Ministry of Employment and Labor, including the government in terms of the minimum wage hikes when it comes to the schedule.I think it will judge carefully. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Okay. Project Committee Chairman Kim Sang-jo said, ' The government is not going to be keeping a watchful eye on the virtual and encrypted currency boom these days. ' Do you agree with Chairman Kim Sang-jo on this direction? The Kim Sang-jo > Block Chain is perhaps an innovative technology with the potential to change the industrial map. However, in order for it to be used as a virtual currency or payment method, it must go through a process of earning public trust. Since the current investment in virtual currencies is actually unstable enough to be called speculation, I think the government should take action to regulate on such activities. These virtual currency exchanges are reporting to our commission, the telecommunications seller under the E-Commerce Act, and in connection with that, the FTC will investigate what obligations these exchanges are under and what obligations they have to meet. We have already gone further and investigated whether they violated the Terms and Conditions laws, such as limiting the withdrawal of customers or imposing excessive exemptions. We are going to make it as soon as possible. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > You are already investigating, have you violated any conditions? Then, is there anything you can catch? We have already investigated the problem of violation of the e-commerce law and the terms and conditions law. Violations of e-commerce laws are likely to result relatively quickly. As for the violation of the Terms and Conditions Act, I would like to get results by at least March. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Does the result control you? It would be more appropriate to call it sanctions than sanctions. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > In such a case, it would be a terrible idea to be here. I want to go to the closing."
"Can you do that? Mr Kim : Actually, we do not have the authority under our e-Commerce law to close the Virtual Money Exchange, but if it is through the various indicia of illegal actions that we have discovered during the investigation, ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I don't know well, but if I give a notice to the related department, can I get rid of it or close it like this? Mr Kim : It is certainly a reality that there is not a proper legal provision relating to it. Because virtual money is a recent phenomenon. We don't have the proper laws. That is not to say that the government can let go of anything. We intend to establish appropriate regulations, sanctions measures, through existing laws, or, if necessary, in accordance with the appropriate market economy principles. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > You have a belief in the part where it is clear that a new law should be created and properly regulated, if it is not possible to become law. Although there have been some wild talk among government agencies recently on this point, I will raise the possibility of a coordinated market with sufficient consultation between government ministries. ◇ Do you think Kim Hyun-jung is gambling, too? The justice minister is gambling, you said. From the economist's point of view, it is his position that he can hardly distinguish investment from speculation. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : As a riddle ... You can not tell the difference between investment and speculation, the lines are ambiguous. Economists understand that it is such a difference between ' I do it, I romance, and other people do it. ' ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > ` It is a gamble that can not be blamed, and you must regulate it properly `. I do not think it is very reasonable for an economist to go in such a direction as to ban the market from doing business. As long as it is to some extent Especially when it comes to violations of the law, there should be some kind of punishment. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > must follow. So you're investigating now, and you can see some places, and the problem is. (Photo : Data photo) ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Okay. I heard about virtual money. The biggest story, about the chaebol reform, remains to be told, Chairman Kim Sang-jo, submit a self-reform bill to the conglomerates. I'll give you a chance to improve your governance structure, make a plan last year. The first deadline was the end of last year, and it's the biggest. Samsung and Hyundai did not submit. The second deadline is March. What if you don't do it by then? Whose son gimsangjo > In fact, just before that Moon Jae-in not a roundabout expression of big businesses, while the president had news conference and the word ‘chaebol’.You have written. It shows chaebol reform will in the entire administration, including the president that you can do. However, the means already our ministries, including the FTC from pledges by the president last year's work plan that contains the details. What this means is that, without retreat, they are going to reform the chaebol with a will that is consistent and predictable. And although I had proposed a deadline like this in December or March, I was at least here in the first half of this year calling for voluntary reform. If there is anything to be said to be unsatisfactory, I plan to make some efforts to ask for a more direct reform by revising the law in the National Assembly from the second half. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Second Dead Line is March. That is when the final deadline ends in the first half. And I say again that in March, I will wait until the end of the shareholders ' meeting because we have to go through a shareholders ' meeting to improve the governance structure. If we don't see any signs of commitment, then at the same level as any of these other departments ' planning, we have a reasonable amendment to our Fair Trade Commission's law to make. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Okay. You said earlier that it is difficult for economists to share investment and speculation. I didn't quite get it right before. The listeners are ready to give us an interpretation. One listener said, ' Doesn't Director Fair Trade Commission say it's ultimately gambling?' Is this the right interpretation for you? Mr Kim : Not necessarily. But the obvious answer, whether it's investment or speculation, is the investor himself. Now, I think it's important for you to keep in mind if you invest that in virtual currencies. Now the price of virtual currency is very volatile. You can make a lot of profit, but I hope you won't forget that you can get into big trouble. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Okay. Let's hear what you have to say. Take the lead in creating a fair society this year. I will do my best. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Thank you. Thank you very much. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung was Chairman of the Fair Trade Commission, Kim Sang-jo.

"Korea University Community Center is also setting up a coin bulletin board … "" Can you get out of Hantanism? "" The book of concern, "" Uldae University, "" and the virtual currency message board of Korea University student community, Choi Pyeong-cheon, a virtual currency bulletin board of the university student community, appeared in the center. "" Until now, no one can go to the Han River, "" said Choi Pyung-cheon, "" until the end of the Internet. They were recently posted on the Internet community "" Snoorife, "" a dedicated Internet community for SNU students who can sign up only after they have confirmed their real names. Seoul National University students said yesterday that they have created a new bulletin board for students on July 11. About 200 virtual money-related articles sprang up when the bulletin board was placed. The message on the message board was divided into four categories _ real estate, derivatives of stock bonds, cipher money and general. In fact, it is a bulletin board dedicated to virtual money. The article asked for advice or information on changing virtual currencies, such as the distribution of the world transactions by interesting lines, and the additions of the Korea Exchange. When the price of virtual currency plummeted, negative articles such as ' I won't show the chart till July 20, ' ' Long time no see you go down, ' and ' Sohoe, who lost the virtual currency. ' Recently, we have asked many people to create a bulletin board that enables them to collect articles on investment, stocks and real estate, said Knuthell's, who posted the bulletin. The exclusive Internet community of Korea University students, Gopas, also recently added a bulletin board on virtual money. Gopas reorganized the "" Stockrechteck Board "" into "" CoinRetalk Board, "" but made the new coin board on the 16th of the sixth day with the focus on the articles on virtual currency. We restructured the message board after users commented that the excessive number of coin-related postings on the anonymous message board was inconvenient, Gopas said. The message board also had the most information on the situation in the virtual currency market, such as whether the coin would go out of business like this, or not buy it now, and about how to invest it. The Korean community, which has been used to freely discuss school or social issues anonymously and share information on university lives, has become a "" virtual currency occupation "" in its words.However, some worry that it is inappropriate to have a separate bulletin board set in a private community, saying, Virtual money is speculation, not investment. Professor of sociology at Kyung Hee University Kang Sub says, "" If you frequently read about virtual currency in the community, you could find it hard to fall into the trap of Han Dong-sik's idea of creating small amounts of money.

"The failure of the deal in Fanixelle has also sent investors reeling from an overnight plunge in virtual currency prices to nearly seven million won. Some people said that the government would make a positive prediction that virtual currency prices would rebound again on July 20 when it was allowed to re-finance the won, but there are pessimism that it would not work.According to the Korea Virtual and Monetary Exchange (KOMSCO) on July 17, the price of Bitcone, which stood at 7 a.m. on August 16, plummeted overnight to 2.87 million won. That means it has dropped more than 30 percent in one day. It is estimated that the amount of bit coins traded in the rain amounted to 378.6 billion won. As domestic and international issues clashed over the virtual currency market, the price of virtual currency plummeted on July 17. A citizen passes by an electronic bulletin board set in front of a virtual currency exchange in downtown Seoul. In addition to Bit-coin, Ripple, the representative virtual currency is trading at around 1200 won per unit, down 49 percent from the previous day, and the rate is down nearly 600,000 won to 12.4 million won. Other coins were also in decline, mostly 30 to 40 %.Investors were immediately shocked. The plunge was so surprising that it led to the sudden selling of virtual currency, called Faniksel, that major Korean exchanges were briefly disrupted by the influx of investors. A 29-year-old virtual currency investor said, "" The ripple coin purchase price went down to 1,033 won per day, down from 2,600 won per unit.Even the virtual currency plunge on this day, Korea`s major virtual currency trading community says, There is a possibility that virtual currency prices will recover with the government's new inflow on July 20, and should start purchasing more now.

"" "" If the new inflow was hit, there was a possibility of a rebound ""However, experts say that the current situation can not be viewed with optimism. "" It looks as if many investors who are currently hurting from the stock market will have to wait for the new inflow on the 20th to come, "" an official at the virtual currency market forecast, "" because it is not likely that they would be able to pull out of the market any further. ""The government is also allowing the Korean won to be deposited again on condition of the real-name on 20th, but investment should be cautious. Financial authorities say, Since virtual currencies such as Bitcone are not legal bills, it is entirely up to investors to make the investment, which is virtually impossible to predict the fluctuations.Everyday items, press /osyoo@heraldcorp.com ▶ yuosang and failed?▶ The Herald Business Channel to set up and glancing over at a time and not to go Mart ▶ fnc hanseongho a representative, unauthorized copyrights © 5 Kits combine the Herald Business! - for a writer and unauthorized war damage and, heraldbiz com.Grill intelligence 'indicated mb' taking money ... summoned the first afternoon, after restraint from redistribution - gimbaekjjun 檢, capturing funds had known circumstances … 金 mb on charges of ""I don't you ever received money"".Lee Myung-bak, former president with the planning for women former presidential gimbaekjjun [Yonhap News Agency db] (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) ijieon godonguk of Journalist : A senior South Korean official Lee Myung-bak administration.National Intelligence Service recorded special activity costs for prosecutors investigating the allegations of illegal fees ""Depending on the progress of investigation as soon as transparent investigation."" revealed the principle that.

"[Donga Ilbo] First North-East Northeast Asian History Foundation, Analysis of the Northeast Asian Castle Museum, China's Northeast Project of the Korean Goguryeo Analysts ' Analysis … The first time the Chosun Dynasty Iljin was explained to be corrupt in Gojoseon … The China's ancient history system of distorted pictures is 70 million people … Buyeo - Goguryeo - Okjeo is a history of Yemak, and the Chosun Ilbo is classified as Han, and a document featuring Gojoseon is displayed. As China rapidly expands its museum to develop its cultural industry, many local exhibitions have confirmed that the history of Goguryeo is being translated into Chinese history. The Northeast Asian History Foundation announced in its recent paper, "" China's Recognition of Koguryo History Through Exhibition, "" that the China Jianan Museum, Tieling Museum and the Northeast Asian Castle Museum were officially discovered, and that Liaoning Province's three major museums were closed.○ The ethnic Koreans in China's precincts are immigrants from the late 19th century. Among the 56 Chinese people, it is the shortest in history and has no connection with the Goguryeo clan. "" It is the Tieling Museum, which is located in Tieling Province, Liaoning Province, China. ' The logic of the fact that Goguryeo was not the ancestor of the Korean people makes it a master of Korean history. This is a municipal museum designated as a ' patriot educational base. ' It is often used as a site for history education for Chinese teenagers. Other descriptions that deny Gojoseon's history were discovered. In an exhibition showing the ancient clan of the northeastern region, Dangun did not even mention it. The reporter classified Chosun as Han, and Bu-Kyungbo - Okjeo, a history of Yemak. An official at the foundation said, We do not recognize the system itself that leads to Gojoseon, Buyeo, the Three Kingdoms, Goryeo and Joseon. The situation was also serious in Jianyi Museum, in Jianyi City, where King Gwanggaeto the Great's tombstone was placed. Jianyi is the home of Gungnaeseong, the capital of Goguryeo. The Jianyi Museum has more than 1,000 pieces of Goguryeo relics and writes them on its own as the center of display of Goguryeo culture. However, this museum described the process of founding Goguryeo as "" When Han Dynasty Unites established Hansagun in 108 B.C., Goguryeon was installed in an area where Goguryeo people lived. Jumong founded the kingdom of Goguryeo in the precincts of Goguryeong, he stated. Jumong and the other people who were operating near the Aprok River conflict with the prevailing theory in our academic world that the military had ousted the powers of Hyundo and founded Goguryeo. After the collapse of Goguryeo, the peoples merged into Han, or other peoples, and the history of the Revival and Balhae and Goryeo of the people was confirmed to have been completely ignored.○ The Chinese government's involvement in the history scandal is the backdrop for Chinese scholars ' perception of history. In October 2015, the Chinese Communist Party disclosed its plan to enact its 13th annual plan for the Chinese central economy and social development at its 18th general meeting of the Central Committee. The development plan includes development of the service industry, including cultural industries, among the five major developmental ideologies. The detailed policies include, We will utilize the National Museum of Korea as a patriotism base for Chinese civilization. It is estimated that around 5,000 national and public museums are currently operating throughout China. It is intended to actively utilize the argument of the Northeast Project to boost national patriotism. The problem is that if similar claims to the logic of the Northeast Project are displayed without any restriction, it could trigger a rift between the two countries. It is not easy for us to ignore historical information that many overseas tourists will face. An official at the Northeast Asian History Foundation said, "" The role and importance of Chinese museums in China are growing to have statistics suggesting that they have more than 700 million visitors per year.

A similar situation was also suspected when Justice Minister Park Sang-kee told a news conference on Tuesday that he was preparing legislation to ban the trading of virtual currency through the exchange. After the news release of Park's news conference, the virtual currency price plummeted, but within a day, the market price recovered. However, many point out that with such a situation, since there are no laws to regulate it, there is no way to regulate virtual currency market price manipulation as if it were punishing operational forces in the stock market. The current law, Capital Markets and Financial Investment Business (Capital Markets Act), directs stock sellers and buyers to falsely trade stocks or to spread false rumors related to the stock market. If this applies to virtual currencies such as Bit-Coins, the Capital Markets Act should be amended to recognize the virtual currency transaction as identical or similar to the stock exchange. However, the legislative direction that the government is reviewing is different. The Ministry of Justice and others are reviewing a measure to ban speculative virtual currency transactions, and when the measures are materialized, it will be harder to apply the asset market law banning the sale of virtual currency. It is because it is difficult to identify virtual currency that prohibits transactions with stocks that guarantee legitimate transactions. As a result, the argument is attracting public attention that virtual currency transactions should be allowed entirely through the exchange and various regulations should be adopted under the Capital Markets Act. The logic goes against the fact that the virtual currency transaction is not a business solution to prohibit domestic transactions because it is possible to trade it not only through the domestic exchange but also through the overseas exchange. In particular, virtual currency transactions are available anytime, unlike stock transactions. Furthermore, some point out that more regulations are needed because safety measures such as the suspension of transactions (brake system) are not in place due to a sharp rise in the market price or a fall. The National Assembly, on the other hand, has been sitting back on legislation. Currently, not a single revision bill has been proposed to regulate virtual currency. Prosecutors have also failed to respond to their attempts to manipulate virtual currency quotation. Even if the capital market law is indicted by analogy, it is unlikely that it will be found guilty. Instead, the government is focusing on cracking down on crimes of circulating currency, crimes of similar receiving and fraud. An official of the prosecution said, The worst crime involving the nature of virtual currency is the manipulation of the market, resulting in crime returns that would have to be multiplied by the tens or even hundreds of times by simple exchange or similar exchanges. hyun@yna.co.kr"
"Bitcone's crash ... "" I deleted the exchange's apps to stay out of the market.

At the same time, the price of the dollar is sold for 1,240,000 won and the ripple price is sold for 1,471 won. Investors who usually believe that a sharp decline will lead to a rebound are also anxious as the bearish market grows longer.

According to the National Statistical Office on July 14, 17 to 17 million fathers took childcare or housework among the economically inactive population last year, the highest number since 2003 when standards were set. In detail, the number of males who focus on housework is 166,000, and the number of males who try to raise their children is 4,000. Starting with 106,000 persons in 2003, the number of full-time childcare and family members rose to 161,000 in 2010, followed by 147,000 in 2011 and 2012, 144,000 in 2013 and 130,000 in 2014. However, the number of students who went on to increase to 150,000 in 2015, and it reached its highest level last year with 161,000 in 2016 and 170,000 last year.The increase is being led by a stay-at-home mom. The NSO will classify the person at home as ' childcare ' to care for preschoolers before entering elementary school, and the other people who do household chores as ' household '. The number of full-time childcare mothers decreased slightly to 8,000 in 2015, 7,000 in 2016 and 4,000 last year. The number of male households with only family ties increased to 142,000 in 2015, 154,000 in 2016, and 166,000 last year. However, the number of women who only carry on childcare and housework stood at 6.94 million last year, showing the opposite tendency. The number of such women decreased to 7.14 million in 2014, the first time it decreased from the previous year, and has decreased for the fourth straight year. It dropped to 708,500 in 2015, 704,000 in 2016 and 6,845,000 last year. It was the first time in eight years that the number of childcare and family members returned to the 6 million mark in 2009 (6.69 million). The number of men devoted to childcare and home care is on the rise, while the reason why the number of women is on the decline is due first to the increasing age of age. NSO explained that men who do not work after retirement and stay at home exclusively take care of household duties. Another reason is that the employment rate is rising, mostly among women in their 30s. Sexual stereotypes about the role of gender are collapsing. The employment rate of women in their 30s last year was 59.2 percent, the highest semi-annual figure since 1999, when statistics were compiled. As the trend continues, women in their thirties entering the labor market due to the trend of marrying and married couples, can not afford to ignore the fact that the gender equality of the retired generation has become a factor in the job market.[Table] Population without childcare or family care (Unit : 1,000) ※ Data : National Statistical Office (NSO) Summaring.communication and inquiry) ▶ News and one-on-one chatting with the reporter < Pyeongchang Winter Olympics Video Contest"
"▽ The year 2018 = Many busy houses face the challenge of hiring people and the poor economy, so I feel uneasy about my ` answer ` and ` answer to my question ` with some kind of fear. As the long unemployment crisis and the sluggish economy continue to make a dent in the future, a growing number of teenagers are looking for the ' right answer. ' Q : Hong Seon-ju, journalist # 2018 Early years of martial arts training. There is a tearoom crowded with people. It is not just a car that is brought in, but a saju café that is visited by people who are lucky to buy rice. It is so popular that you have to wait for about two hours before you can enter. Visitors to the area are young and in their 20s to mid 30s. Kim Yoon-hee, 29, a office worker who has been coming to pay tribute for the past two years, said, I have always admired seeing tarot cards as a way to get past the hard times. ■ Employment Buckles, Depression ... Many young people are turning their eyes to the new year with spots that will soothe future uncertainties. Expectations for the new year and fear of its unknown causes are causing huge demand for good luck. Alvar heaven, a portal specializing in job searching and job placement services, surveyed 1,608 members in their teens and thirties from Dec. 21-29 last year and found that 90 percent of respondents had a fortune report. The stars of interest varied by age. Among teenagers and 20s, "" Love Woon "" ranked first with 46.5 % and 41.5 % respectively, while "" Re-lined "" (69.7 %) was the highest among those in their 30s. The reason for fortunetelling was curiosity or anxiety about the future. 42.7 percent of the respondents said they saw it out of vague curiosity, and 22.9 percent said they looked for comfort in the future. As more and more people pay attention to the store, there are many ways to see the store. In the past, there was only a direct way to visit a fortune teller, but recently, you can easily get a fortune using a smartphone application. When you look for a place to stay in feng shui, you can check it by looking at Google maps and road views. The Sangsan-Taro Cafe is also expanding to target the younger generation who are interested in tarot points or saju puzzles but are unable to find a store easily. You can easily see Cafe and Street vendors lined up in single file at Hongik University, Konkuk University and Gangnam stations. The saju pool costs 50,000 won per student, and tarot card points cost 30,000 won per student, which is a little burden, but has already secured regular customers. As the long unemployment crisis and the sluggish economy continue to make a dent in the future, a growing number of teenagers are looking for the right answer. Last year, the jobless rate among young people aged 15 to 29 was the lowest ever. According to the National Statistical Office, the jobless rate among young people stood at 9.9 percent last year, the highest since 2000. Unemployment among young people has worsened every year with 8.0 percent in 2013, 9.0 percent in 2014 and 9.2 percent in 2015. Cho Min-young, a college student who goes to the saju café three to four times a month, said, "" I usually worry about my job, but I feel much better when I get a job. "" ■ Materialist increase in people depending on dots.Some people want to depend on fatalistic factors in front of the tasks they face in their lives, such as entrance into a house, getting a job, dating and marrying, doing business, and being healthy. Hagwon lecturer Ahn Joo-young said, "" I feel more uneasy about my friends marrying one by one. "" And of course, I know what I want to do with my life. There are numerous postings calling for recommendations on good results, including "" Good job opportunities, "" "" Good luck with your work, "" and "" Good luck with entrance exams. "" If a store is recommended, leave a review and assess whether the fortune was correct or not. It takes two or three months to get to the store, where people are rumored to have good fortune telling. Some say that you can express your worries even when a sign does not agree with you, and are comforted by the fact that some people listen to you. A house acts as a kind of counseling center. While psychological centers are under the burden of having to pay an average of 100,000 won per hour and pay less per visit per day, discounters are relatively inexpensive because their contents are not documented and their prices are relatively low. "" There are a lot of teenagers who ask for counseling due to the intense pressure on jobs these days, "" said an official at the psychological counseling center. "" Unlike the underlying healing process, "" the limitations of understanding the client's condition are not helping. sjh321@fnnews.com correspondent Shin Ji-hye (2005).

"【 Nusis-Go Beomjun : When the Seoul Micro-Spread Reduction Act was announced on July 17, a notice on the ice rink in Seoul said, "" We will be discontinued due to fine dust.

The decision on whether or not to issue an emergency reduction measure shall be made at 5 p.m. on the same day and announced and disseminated at 5:15 p.m. The application time is from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. the following day. The first Seoul type of micro-dust emergency reduction measure was carried out on July 14. Since its implementation in July last year, the emergency reduction measures have been announced for the first time. As of July 15, the public transportation agencies including ▲ / Citizen Participation Vehicle Sub-Passenger &amp; amp ; Run-building agencies and their businesses ' parking lots were closed for free. However, from the first day on, the storm was violent, including controversy over its effectiveness. The biggest problem was the changeable weather. As the wind shifted on July 15, the dust moved to the south of the peninsula, and as it rained, the fine dust remained moderate. In addition, the concentration of fine dust rose suddenly after 9:00 p.m. when emergency reduction measures were broken, and no emergency reduction measures were implemented on July 16. The free transportation to and from work hours, which was a form of incentive for the second subtitle of the citizen-participated car, has become embroiled in a populist argument. Gyeonggi Province Governor Nam Kyung-pil, who has opposed free transportation to the capital area, said, We need to come up with a fundamental fine dust measures, not a populist but a radical one. The Seoul Metropolitan Government faced more criticism as the reduction in road traffic volume and the increase in public transportation passengers were found to be modest. The Seoul Metropolitan Government started to fire back. Mayor Park stressed, "" The lives and safety of citizens are more important than the five billion won (which is spent on free transportation), "" and stepped up to the point of emergency reduction. We have also set off a day by not cooperating with the governor, although the problem of fine dust in Gyeonggi is more serious than in Seoul. ▽ New Seoul = People use the subway free of charge at Gwanghwamun Station in the morning of July 17 when the Seoul Metropolitan Government announced its second micro-dust emergency reduction measure.

"" Amid heated debates, the second Seoul type micro-dust emergency reduction measure was announced due to the worsening fine dust on July 16, and detailed measures are being implemented again on July 17. The Seoul government predicted that a series of disputes over emergency reduction measures would rather raise public awareness of fine dust. As emergency reduction measures are repeatedly announced and the dust becomes more serious, more and more citizens will join the second wave of citizen-participated cars, creating a virtuous cycle in which more and more people can use public transportation. Seoul city officials said, In the end, it is a task to reduce the number of fine dust particles by reducing the number of cars or traffic, adding, We will also promote public relations and expand the autonomy area needed to encourage the reduction of traffic. "" We expect that any effort to increase the rate of traffic reduction (emergency reduction) will have some effect, "" he said, adding, "" in terms of the small amount of lives saved from the dust reduction, it will be a healthy measure for citizens. "" Meanwhile, the Seoul Micro-Spread Emergency Control System is based on the Environmental Protection Act, which defines fine dust as a natural disaster rather than just a weather problem.

The Japanese government's plan to delay the opening age of public pension to 67 % two years after 2020 revision. The later the pension is paid, the more the pension is paid. Although Japan already has many elderly people working in it, it intends to overcome the problems of an aging society, including a lack of workers, by encouraging them to work harder through pension reform. According to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the Japanese government's recent plan on an aging society will review the system that enables the start of pension supply after the age of 70. Although it was discussed that the current pension age limit is 65 and allow people to choose between 60 and 70 years of age, it is the first time that the government has chosen ' over 70 ' as the choice. The central photo pension fund, which is being consulted in the support section of Hatoyama's Newtown in Saitama Prefecture, Japan, receives an additional 0.7 % increase in pension provision for every month earlier at the age of 65. For example, starting at 66, an increase in monthly income by 8.4 percent from the age of 65. If you are 70, you will get 42 percent more. The Japanese government plans to add more than 0.7 percent interest rates if the pension starts to pay later than 70. The upper limit of age at which a person enters the age of supply is discussed between 70 and 75 and 80. The ministry will discuss the details at the social security committee of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare before submitting a revision to the National Assembly by 2020 at the latest. The Japanese government is considering extending the starting age of pension to create an environment for healthy elderly people to work more aggressively to keep pace with the advancement of aging. As the number of elderly people who can be produced decreases sharply due to the aging population and the decline in the population, it is urgent to utilize the old population. Under the plan, the government plans to provide Hello Work to job seekers who want to apply for reemployment at job support agencies operated by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and the elderly who want to start businesses. Other companies are seeking support for extending the retirement age or hiring people. Older job seekers look at the recruitment information at the "" 60 + Senior Workers ' Party "" held at Bexco, Haeundae, Busan yesterday. The Japanese government is set to increase the employment rate of workers aged between 60 and 64 from 63.6 percent as of 2016 to 67 percent by 2020. The plan points out that the general trend of seeing people aged 65 or older as ` the elderly ` in general does not reflect the phenomenon and is not realistic. "" We will also review standardized policies to make our society ageless, where people of all ages can act with the will and ability to live up to their wishes. "" Until the first implementation of the pension system in Japan, the age of pension was 55 when it was first introduced. As the Japanese government grows older, it has slowly raised the age of supply and demand. ▽ Tokyo correspondent Yoon Sul-young Snow0 @ Joongang.co.crt = Facebook [Facebook], the online logistics company's owner, [Morbeil Plus Co.], and J.T.C.BC Content AgencyDongbu Police Station in Yong-in, Gyeonggi Province, investigating the accident, announced yesterday that it booked three construction workers, two auditors at the site, and one construction subcontractor for dismantling construction site.

It was painted by Van Gogh in 1886 when he lived in Paris, France with Antwerp, Belgium. Van Gogh worked at a studio in Pernand Cormont, a famous French artist. The Quarrying of the Montmartre Hill was unknown to the public because it was privately owned, and was then checked at the Van Gogh Museum in 2013 to determine if it was genuine.

"[CBS [Cisazaro : Chung Kwan-Chang's Office] - Warren Buffett's ' The End of Cryptosystems won't Be Good ' - Guardian : France's Case Studies Show : 20 % Possible Park-dodging System : No Government Can Be Ahead - Welcome, Director Im Sang-hoon of the International Center for Critic and Arts. How are you? ◇ Government use > What news shall we listen to first? I can almost say for sure that the end of encrypted money is not good. Of course, I don't have a position to say that. And it's not my word, it's Warren Buffett. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong : Warren Buffett : A genius of investing. And I don't mean to defend Warren Buffett's comment. And I don't mean to argue that, but I do think the active debate about virtual money in the country recently, the foreign media, is starting to get interested in it again. The Guardian newspaper in Britain reported on last week 11 on the virtual currency boom in Korea. And I mentioned it at the beginning, because I now quoted Warren Buffett at the end of the article. The Guardian says he will never sit back and avoid tax evasion when it comes to cryptoking money from anywhere in the world. ◇ Government service > Don't you think our country is more boisterous now? So the foreign press is reporting the virtual currency controversy in Korea. Mr Im Sang-hoon > Yes. So when you look at the foreign news media coverage of the virtual currency controversy in this country, you can imagine that. Do you feel like you're seeing things first in Korea? I feel like I am watching various responses among investors, the government and the people in Korea. The Guardian in Britain, as I just introduced, has two sides to the story about the virtual currency crisis in Korea, and I think that's what I'm saying. First of all, the Korean government said that increasing sanctions would prove that it is worth investing in encrypted currency. ◇ Government sanctions, government sanctions, government sanctions -- you can think, well, there is something here. Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. So, you can think in reverse. Now, if you're talking about reverse logic, and you do it safely and safely, then this paper says, you'd better look for something else to invest in. So, real supporters of Bitcone can buy it now and try to get on a roller coaster and wait until it recovers, but no government would be able to do anything to keep their hands off the Korean government. Every government wants to keep the monetary system intact and act on encrypted currency if it becomes a problem. ◇ Government service > ` It is all being used as a dispossession `, ` this is a problem `, all of which agree? But when you reprimand this, you actually deprecate technology. Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. But I'm starting to wonder if there's any logical confusion in the argument that's going on over this virtual currency. If you look at the logic of the people who are protesting against these virtual monetary sanctions, do they think they're resisting the advances of technology, or do they think they're going to deal with the threat of an excessive speculative force? For example, when we talk about government involvement, we often see people refuting block chains and encrypted money by going down like this. If they say so, I understand, but it is hard for even the eating generation to understand why they are simply disobeying government intervention and sanctions as resistance to technology. Now, I'm going to show you a little bit earlier, from this point of view, the Guardian newspaper, right? Bitcoin (Photo : Data photo) ◇ Straint you wrote about it? Wouldn't it be that the price of an Imsanghoon > Bitcone can vary significantly depending on the number of stores it takes to mine its limited supply? And I think, in that sense, you could compare it with minerals like jewelry, but the government didn't just let it go, did it? So when something becomes a social scale phenomenon, governments have no choice but to intervene in some form because even if there is a technological evolution, overheated speculation is also evolved. As the Guardian pointed out in a Korean case, ◇ Government intervention is needed in dealing with overheated speculation. Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. What the foreign press keeps saying is, the most important thing is overheating. They say that the virtual currency transaction amount currently being made in our country is higher than that in the U.S., that is, at the highest price in the world. Jung Kwan-yong : Isn't it true that there is a saying that goes, "" Kimchi premium? "" Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. So the idea is that it's paying more than 30 percent of the premium price to trade, which is not sustainable in terms of a country's economic standards, is that if it doesn't, it's going to create an ideal fire pollution. In the French newspaper Le Figaro, today. Currently, 20 % of the world market's Bitcone exchange is in Korea. This is 10 times larger than the size of the Korean economy. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > South Korea does not represent 20 % of the global economy. ; It is not ; it is not. Eventually, Bitcone may have benefited some investors significantly, but the Korean newspaper says it is too dangerous for the general public, and therefore the Korean government is trying to control Figaro. So, I'm going to fight against the money that's going to be sold exclusively by the central bank, but if it's virtual, and it only adds to the confusion of the monopoly, why should people want it? ◇ Government policy > Guardian or Le Figaro, the British and French influential, and that's why the government can't sit still. Now that the government has made such a comment on the matter, it says that more than 200,000 people have applied for sanctions against the presidential office, especially young people. But the do was Moon Jae-in and the government's support base is young people? Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. Japan's Nikkei has just reported on this. It's Moon Jae-in government's brewing dilemma and introduce so. This is a dilemma. The Nikkei newspaper reported on July 13, but most of the investors in the virtual currency market are in their 20s and 30s. That is why they overlap with the main support groups of the current administration. If they dream of making a fortune at once and are speculative enough to shake the common sense of the labor-based economy, the regulations will be tightened, but resistance by them is more than expected. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > Didn't the foreign press analyze why the younger generation was especially angry? Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. So, these are the words of the petitions posted in Cheong Wa Dae. Have you ever had the government make people dream? Investment is the individual responsibility, whether an individual succeed or fails, in a petition now posted on the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae, and if an individual becomes a group, wouldn't it matter if that failure were a social problem? ◇ Government use > That's the problem. Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. As the Nikkei newspaper focuses on this point, it explains, "" The Korean people's dream is to make a fortune at one time, so they are going to escape from the earth. "" However, is this really the dream of the working class that a society should encourage and promote? The problem is that we have to ask ourselves questions that society might be misinting indicators. It is this that requires the eyes of foreign media outside, so why not question the younger generation and make them feel like they are being unclean? So when you read this article in the Nikkei newspaper, you can see that these guys have a huge dissatisfaction with the older generation, this great dissatisfaction, that they have, they can hide together. ◇ Government service > The young generation is based on the great dissatisfaction of the older generation, and the older generation is not claiming virtual currency restrictions. So you are against the regulation of virtual currency? Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. So, the younger generation is dreaming of making a fortune off virtual currency, as the Nikkei newspaper said earlier. So now, when you're a grown-up, you have found in this speculation that you have an abnormal profit structure that's not virtual money, but you can't compare it to real estate. ◇ Government use. While they are safely inside, the younger generation looks to a giant adult apartment that can never get inside while working outside. They go in there."
