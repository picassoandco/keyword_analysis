U.S. News 1 : Oh Jang-hwan (Suwon = News 1), a reporter of the North Korean Central Hospital in the South Korean War, was shot down by North Korean soldiers during an operation to recover from the South Korean National University Hospital.The district trauma center moved a 24-year-old defector to a hospital in Seoul on July 24.According to multiple officials, Oh is recovering quickly. Oh will eat clear porridge and receive treatment from the department of mental health and orthopedics there.Oh was unconscious after her second operation on July 15, but regained consciousness five to 20.Until July 20, he had complained of pain from the operation caused by a bullet wound, but now he is stable and can communicate with doctors in a basic manner.However, the medical team is closely watching the situation as inactive tuberculosis and type B infection were detected in the upper and lower parts of the right lung.At the same time, they are closely watching for symptoms of intestinal obstruction, which prevents the minister from passing through the intestine due to various reasons.The medical team will monitor Oh further and discuss the condition with the authorities before moving to the military hospital.Lee Guk-jong, a professor at the Out-of-Seoul Center in South Gyeongsang Province, said, We expect many patients to recover in about a month, adding, We are recovering fast because we are young patients, but we are still cautious about drug reactions.hm0712@news1.kr Now operating hundreds of machines around Seoul, he said, "" When I first started my own vending machine business, I couldn't afford to get a coffee machine in five years, "" adding, "" If I could get a coffee machine out of my highway rest area, I couldn't afford one. ""As Korean coffee makers have drastically changed their tastes, coffee vending machines are collapsing rapidly. According to the Korea Association of vending machines manufacturers, production of coffee machines fell from 30,000 units in 1990 to 836 last year. More than 3,700 cars were made in 2008 alone, but the volume decreased by 200-500 units per year during the decade.The company's coffee vending machine has dropped sharply to less than 20 percent of what it was ten years ago. The number of coffee machines operating as well as Sung Hyung-joo's journalist output is decreasing sharply. Coffee vending machines manage the FDA, but the number of food vending machines dropped to 25,000 in 2015 from 72,200 in 2008, according to the Food and Drug Administration statistical report released by the FDA. It was in the mid 1990s that the coffee machines began to suffer when it was pushed out by coffee beans, said Park Young-soon, head of the Coffee Critics ` Association. Hallis Coffee, Korea`s first franchise coffee store, opened in 1998 and Starbucks Coffee opened here in 1999.The popular brand of coffee machine operators has also changed its so-called "" one-quality "" brand, which is popular. In the 1990s, it was an office building, university, and amusement park with a lot of companies. Coffee vending machines, installed at the office of 500 office workers, sold coffee 1,500 times a day. When you fill your coffee machine with ingredients, you can make an average of 600 cups. Because they sold so much, they hired university students as their part-time jobs for vending machines managers at universities and security guards at their office buildings so that they could quickly fill the machines when they ran out of materials.Kim, 55, who runs dozens of coffee machines in Suwon, said, We refilled two or three times a day until 10 years ago, but now we don`t have enough customers to fill it once or twice a week. According to industry watchers, the top three districts these days are Bob's House, a production plant, and a news restaurant. Autoseller sales partners say, "" In the past, coffee lovers were always present or were willing to go to places where coffee was cheap, ranging from 200 to 300 won ""It has been more than 10 years since coffee beans with sugar and creamer in them were brewed. However, industry watchers say there is another reason why the vending machine coffee was forced out."" When I went to the motorway service, I couldn't tell if I wanted to drink coffee from a vending machine, "" said CEO Kang Sung-hyo, "" and I rarely saw anyone sitting next to the machine while handling the old or ugly coffee machine. As franchise coffee restaurants opened in the rest area, vending machines were forced out of sight, and therefore no more to drink.Some blame it on the free coffee of paper cups. The restaurant serves free mixed-mixes with coffee, and we don`t understand why we should pay to drink, said Park Young-soon, head of the association. In fact, unlike vending machine coffee, the coffee mix market has grown to 1.3 trillion won by 2012. As of 2015, the coffee mix market was 970 billion won, which is weaker than the vending machine market. [Kim Soo-kyung : Comprisions are now on the rise. The National Tax Service (NTS) reported on July 25 that the number of people who died last year exceeded 3 billion won in the amount of assets including property under the bullet, according to the National Tax Service (NTS). Compared to 10 years ago, 399 students in 2006, the number increased by 2.6 times.The amount of property in the bullet wounds of the person who leaves behind a large sum of money in the child [donation ; Cho Hae-in] is the total value of the property in the bullet wounds of the person during the commencement of inheritance (the date of death) and at the time of death. It serves as the basic data for determining inheritance tax rates. Pensions with more than 5 billion won in total bullet wounds were also more than doubled from 195 in 2006 to 449 in 2016, while those with more than 10 billion won in assets were affected by the same period.As more and more people pass on their large sums of money, the total inheritance has grown. The total size of property in the bullet wounds was 5.94 trillion won in 2006, almost tripled to 16.3.92 trillion won last year. The inheritance tax rate will be classified into five levels. The maximum tax rate is applied when the standard of assessment for inherited or donated assets exceeds 3 billion won, excluding non-taxable items or deductions. The increase in the amount of assets handed down is presumed to have been caused by a number of complicated factors, including price hikes. Some worry that the increase in the amount of money could reduce the possibility of a shift in class as parents ' wealth (Kao) is more likely to determine their children's economic status. Economics professor Kim Nak-nyeon at Dongguk University said, As a society with a high growth rate has high income growth rates, we can overcome differences with our ability even if we don`t inherit our parent assets, and thus have a low starting point. He estimated that "" the larger asset sizes have already taken various "" tax relief "" measures and that the more undisciplined assets have been acquired, "" much larger than the wealth. sewonlee@yna.co.kr"
"Economics and second-grade actors spent 18 minutes solving the exchange rate theory's "" you need to know the broad economy's story "", or six passages to answer. It is a problem that needs to be understood in general terms : "" It is an overshooting of Korean language workers who have dropped test takers for the 2018 College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) into the "" Menbung "" section. The Bank of Korea leads the nation's monetary policy. Employees are considered elite in the financial world. He majored in economics and business administration. Many students also say that they are good at university. The central bank officials also shook their heads. The Korean language fingerprint (odd type) of 2018 grades that addressed the theory of overshooting of exchange rates, and the question that also embarrassed Han's employees was the questions 27 to 32 on the CSAT (odd type) Korean language. The fingerprint, which explained the relationship between government policy means and price rigidity and exchange rates, addressed the American economist Rudiger Dornbush's "" Over Shooting Theory. "" He explained that the exchange rate would fluctuate too much in the short term due to the inflexibility of prices. One of the representative theories of exchange rate variability is that the economics department at universities usually covers it after the second grade. Over Shooting ' is when you pass the place you originally intended to go and go farther. Any impact on the economy would mean that it would significantly deviate from the average level of the long term but gradually converge toward the long-term equilibrium level over time. When asked what they thought, employees replied, "" I have a high level of difficulty. "" One official, who requested anonymity, spent 13 minutes solving the problem, but said he missed two of the six questions. The seven-year-long senior official said, The most complicated question for test-takers was like the number 30 problem, which is a graph of the overshoot theory. If you know this theory, you can choose the answer without difficulty, but it would have been difficult to find the answer with your fingerprints. The 29 questions on currency fluctuations due to the inflow of funds were also pointed out as difficult to answer. Meanwhile, another BOK official said, The 27 questions confirming the understanding of the fingerprints and 31 questions asking about ways to adjust the details of overshooting could have found the answers if you had read the fingerprints carefully. The Han bank employees, whose children were recently tested for the CSAT, also solved the problem. One official, who said, "" If I had enough time, I could get my answers right, "" adding, "" If I had enough time, I could get my answers carefully, but when I saw the answers, I should have the general price and money rates. "" Although the CSAT seems to develop into a test of depth in thinking and reasoning, it seems rather difficult for high school students to solve it, he said. It is not the first time that an economic question has been asked in the Korean language section of the CSAT. Insurances on insurance in the national language section of the March 1st CSAT are also considered to be tough questions. At the time, the related question consisted of six questions and dealt with the economic principles covered by insurance and the obligation to notify the public of business law. Ha Hyun-ok, reporter of Joongang.co.crk, http://joongang.co.kr Analysts say that the retired baby boomer (born from 1955-1936) is experiencing excessive competition as he enters the low-restricted accommodation and restaurant business market. According to the National Statistical Office on July 25, the index of accommodation and restaurant service output in the third quarter of this year was 95.0. The index is based on sales, etc., and is the index of the current production levels of the affected industries based on 2010 as 100. That means the output of the accommodation and restaurants sector in the third quarter fell 5 percent from the 2010 average. On a quarterly basis, the index of accommodation and restaurant production often surpassed 100 from 2007 to 2010, but the index remained sluggish thereafter. From 2011 to the third quarter, the number of passes over 100 was only two times between the second quarter of 2011 (101.6) and the third quarter of 2014 (100.7). The speed of decline has become faster in recent years. It dropped from 99.0 in the first quarter of 2015 to 98.3 in the first quarter of 2016 and then to 94.7 in the fourth quarter of 2016. It continued to fall to 94.5 in the first and second quarters of this year. Meanwhile, the amount of money that individual businesses or restaurants borrowed from deposit handling institutions such as banks, mutual savings banks, and mutual financing has increased sharply. According to the Bank of Korea, the amount of loans to the accommodation and restaurants amounted to 49.365 trillion won at the end of September this year, approaching 50 trillion won. Compared to the end of 2010 (26.31 trillion won), seven years ago, the figure rose 87.2 percent. As the size of the economy or the market itself grows, the amount of loans should increase. The problem is that the increase is too fast. The quarterly loan increase (compared to the previous year) of the accommodation and restaurant industries was 50 billion to 300 billion won, but the growth has increased sharply since then. The total increase in the fourth quarter of last year was 1.72 trillion won, the largest increase ever, with the first and second quarters of this year (933.3 billion won) and the third quarters (1.17 trillion won) continuing. As the loan growth and production decline of the accommodation and restaurants businesses began to show signs of a slowdown, it was the year the baby boomer retired. Analysts say that the baby-boomers who could not prepare for their retirement were forced to open accommodations or restaurants to make ends meet, and the market was saturated and production slowed. Another reason for the reduction in the number of Chinese who took up a large proportion of foreign tourists during China's retaliation against the deployment of the THAAD (High Level Missile Defense) early this year is due to an increase in the amount of room and restaurant businesses. As the wholesale and retail business, accommodation and restaurant business generally appears to be dominated by self-employed business, said a central bank official, many of whom are starting businesses that are more open to retired baby boomers and youths. porque@yna.co.kr"
"Professor Lee Kyung-il, who complained bitterly during a weekly briefing about the treatment of North Korean soldiers, wrote to the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae, "" Professor of Public Administration and Medical Center for the Health, Jungchungwa University of Seoul, and SNU's call center for the attention on which to be made. The whole engine is in trouble. "" I don't get full and can't accept the room … "" "" I'm just a terminal worker, not a policy maker. As a policy tool, you can only work on the above. "" It is often a shame that the government failed to produce results on the trauma center that was injected with taxpayers ' money. We have no specialist. She says she's a doctor who hits and tries to catch me, but she has to be a doctor to hit me. Severe trauma center is not sustainable in Korea. "" "" I heard you say, ' If you were one of the Big Five hospitals, you wouldn't have told. ' "" And one of them was loyal to the organization. I'm not loyal to the organisation and I'm going to go and look at just people. "" I don't want to hear anything bad about government policy from a rural doctor, "" he said. "" I'll tell you what, I'll hear it. "" That's why I said I was a university town. Good university. Major hospitals didn't have to brief me like this. As such, this is the only time Korea's ' Korean University, Korea University and Yonsei University ' has set up a serious trauma center. "" - ' Welcome to the second round of the Korean Army Resident-General Lee Jae-Jong's Presidence Center, ' on November 22. Speaking at the second round of briefings at Aju University in Suwon, Sunday, Lee Guk-jong, chief of the hospital's regional trauma center, sounded determined and expressed strong. The head of the public relations team urged me to "" make it fast "" during the briefing, and Lee Guk-jong, the director of the Center for Public Relations, said, "" Sir, can you please delete me ... from my hospital? Should I put all of the stereotypic papers I received from the hospital? "" Although not all of these remarks and processes were made public in the media, I think Lee's appeal was enough to win over the public. The petition has been posted at the Presidential Office of Cheong Wa Dae, and has already been posted at the "" Cheong Wa Dae's New Forest and Environmental Support Center. "" It was the second most entrusted-generated petition since Cho Doo-soon's "" No Coming Out "" (540,000) visit as of Friday afternoon. In addition, more than 500 petitions were pouring in to support Professor Lee and increase support for local trauma centers and treatment for serious patients. As things stand, it is very likely that Cheong Wa Dae will answer the so-called petition of Lee Gook-jong. The presidential office has set up a policy that says the government and presidential office officials will prepare a related answer if the petition is approved by more than 200,000 within 30 days. As they say in the petition, "" We are the world's most vulnerable truce nation, but how many doctors in this country are able to treat severe trauma, including bullet wounds, fractures? After questioning whether the system is adequate enough to respond, they are sacrificing their health (they) to save others ` lives. Other regions ' trauma centers are also known to watch their hospitals. As patients are treated, the hospital's deficits increase. Now the nation needs to protect them. "" So how, what, can the state keep them? How should Cheong Wa Dae answer these requests? Today, we will learn about this in The Chingi. Support for the Regional trauma center is pouring into the home of Cheong Wa Dae. Cheong Wa Dae Nurisae GalmurI : What is a regional trauma center?May we first find out what a local trauma center is? You don't think you're on credit as a way to get a product or service first and pay for it later, right? The dictionary definition of trauma involves a full set of external injuries. Specifically, the trauma classification guidelines set forth above. At a height of more than 3 m (3 floor) for adults who fall at a height of 6 m (3 floor) for children, break down at a speed of more than 32 km/h for motor vehicles and two roller coaster vehicles for injury or injury. So a trauma center can be defined as a specialized center with facilities, equipment and staff to provide emergency surgery to patients who have had their serious injuries in a car accident, crash or other accidents. It's called the Regional trauma center because it's been established locally. The Health and Welfare Ministry planned to reduce the preventable death rate by 2020 from 35.2 % (as of 2010) to less than 20 % (levels of developed countries), and has launched the Community Credit Center Project since 2012. There are currently 16 local trauma centers designated throughout the country and they are currently operated in nine hospitals (Gachundae Hospital, Dankook University Hospital, Dankook University Hospital, Wonju Hospital, and Catholic University Hospital).■ Number of operations in the first half of 2017 at the local trauma center. Did you all agree on the purpose of establishing the graphics Lee Jae-ho press district trauma center? How reassuring it is to know that there are places where we can be treated when we are badly injured. But there is a problem. It has a good intention, but it is not well run. It is known as the "" Light and Good killer. "" The issue is underscored by the data provided by Congressman Kim Sang-hee (Dubul Minjoo Party), who raised doubts about the local trauma center during the National Assembly audit in 2017. The Ajou University Regional trauma Center, led by Lee Guk-jong, conducted a total of 1173 operations in the first half of this year. That's equivalent to the surgeries performed by trauma centers in nearly five lower regions. Rep. Kim Sang-hee of the National Assembly's audit said, "" Local trauma centers exist to prepare for emergencies that may occur at any time, but they have to be fully utilized by minor hospital doctors because of their long wait time, "" and added, "" The medical authorities have to deal with minor medical problems with these cases "" So the local trauma center, which has to treat trauma patients, is doing this out of its responsibility. Some say it is premature to assess the effectiveness of the local trauma center solely on the number of surgeries performed. So I turned around a little bit and looked at the doctors at the local trauma center. No one in the nine local trauma centers filled the staff standards of the local trauma center's specialist workforce. There were 18 patients left at Gacheon-dae Hospital, Mokpo Korean Hospital, and Pusan National University Hospital, and less than 10 patients at EuljI Hospital and Regional trauma center. It is hard to accept that these already deficient doctors are seeing minor patients, not trauma patients. Because the government gives 120 million won a year to the whole local trauma center. Besides the local trauma center, the government has designated two separate trauma clinics in Seoul to train credit specialists, and there are many problems here. The government gives 70 million won to one resident every year, and 900 to one billion won to the hospital respectively, and it is considered to be a nominal payment. Last Chuseok, a three-year-old girl was bitten by a dog and asked for a full supply to a trauma clinic here, but she was denied treatment. An official with one of these hospitals said, "" We've applied for an increase in the operating room, but if we actually have a sufficient number of doctors, we can only treat it. "" ■ The damages are directed at the people while the emergency medical system is carelessly administered. Do you remember the cancellation of last September's Regional trauma center? (Video) Narrator : Everyone dies from a rejection of the incident. Kim arrived at Jeonbuk University's Emergency Medical Center with a fractured pelvis and damaged an internal organ. However, the Jeonbuk University Hospital did not call the orthopedist in the emergency room, and had no coordination with the medical team responsible for image testing, so it failed to assess the severity of the injury to the patient. Jeonbuk University Hospital delayed treating Kim to a nearby local trauma center, Chonnam National University Hospital. However, Chonnam National University Hospital refused to see Kim, and after seven hours of injury, he was transferred to Azu University Hospital, where he died during the surgery. The Health and Welfare Ministry later decided to cancel the designation of the Regional Emergency Medical Center for Jeonbuk National University Hospital by establishing a Central Emergency Medical Committee (emergency committee) to investigate the incident and designate an emergency medical center at Chonnam National University Hospital. Without listing these cases one by one, the adverse health effects of poor emergency care systems on the people are too obvious. As the Health and Welfare Ministry explained in its data, Korea's preventable death rate stood at 35.2 %, two to three times higher than that of the U.S., Germany and Japan. So, when you can live, you can see two to three times more patients dying. We were covering for an article, and an anonymous local trauma center posted it on an online community. Let me tell you a little bit about it here. First, the government promised to inject 400 billion won in the establishment of the trauma center after the opening of the trauma center in the wake of the captain's case of Seokhae-kyun (2011), but the public's interest has declined over time."
"It has become a branch office. The initial plan was to open three or four large trauma centers around the country, concentrate the medical team to 1.7 billion patients, and then half the initial reduction to local areas, but each was decided by local logic. Very few trauma surgeon majors at the time, requiring the training of the medical staff, which requires a great deal of surgery and experience. This is absolutely critical when concentration of severe trauma patients is critical and 17 places from the start are too busy and fire department is still unable to cooperate, resulting in the transfer of serious injuries to local emergency rooms and death. (Medium-sized) There are different numbers of patients in each center, but there are also regional differences, and we can not falsely say that the numbers of surgeries left are enough to avoid or power the rest of the centers down without reason. Most of the reasons for this are burn patients (no burns at the university hospital), joint surgeries such as finger surgery, or power requests from guardians. One of your misconceptions is the fact that the hospital requested the center to collect the funding, which is also incorrect. If designated as a center, the government will provide 8 billion won in facility expenses and the hospital will have to invest the same amount of money in facilities. The country also provides support for specialist labor and education, but nurses in the intensive care unit, ward, and trauma center resuscitation rooms are provided by hospitals. We're actually investing quite a bit in hospitals. Most of the trauma doctors at the center I've seen have lost patients who didn't have to die. Each of them had their own beliefs and beliefs and went into a trauma that no one would do. The Korean trauma system is now in its infancy. Professor Lee Guk-jong tries to keep the developed system in Korea, but it seems that the system is very difficult because it is not built soon. Ultimately, the evolution of the system and the deployment of the system will require your ongoing attention, surveillance and support. ■ Reduction in the budget of the serious trauma suspect…The national health system is being compromised in the blind spot of the emergency medical system, and next year, the national trauma center's budget will be significantly decreased. Looking at the 2018 budget proposal submitted to the National Assembly, the nation's major trauma care system budget was 40.04 billion won, down 3.9 billion won from 43.6 billion won this year. Media reports and data indicate that the 2016 trauma center budgets were cut off during a budget consultation process. Among the 2016 budget, the amount of unused money reached 101 billion won. I had set aside 4 billion won for the installation of the Gyeong-Nam trauma center, but I couldn't afford it because I didn't have an applicant, and I had no intention to provide 120 million won for a payroll surgeon. "" Even if you pay hundreds of millions of won to get a trauma surgeon to the hospital, you won't see any volunteers, "" a university hospital specialist said. But could it be different this time? As Lee Guk-jong, head of the Center for Health and Welfare, spoke with hundreds of petitions from the public, the ministry also took a stand. Kwon Deok-cheol, vice minister of welfare, told the National Assembly on July 24, "" As the issues concerning serious trauma are being raised every day, the local trauma center and the pay system will be reviewed thoroughly. "" If we summarize them, I think this is where we need to start discussing how we can hire more people. Now can you see what we should ask of the government, and what kind of answer should Cheong Wa Dae have? Lee Jae-ho, journalist, please be my best friend in the Hankyoreh!

It is a sleeping cafe. Park said, I usually went to sauna during my lunch break. But since I saw her in the sauna not long ago, I have made an alternative to her because I have no idea. He said, It is so quiet and pleasant that I can take a nap and go to work. Office worker Kim (28, female) should visit a nearby sleeping cafe at lunch time at least once a week. There is nothing I can do about getting sleepy in the morning. I often go to the sleeping cafe during lunch time. I know it's a stupe consumption, but I can't help it. If you sit in a massage chair, drink a cup of tea and close your eyes, you will feel refreshed the rest of the day. Sleep cafes, also referred to as healing cafes, are popular among office workers in their 20s and 30s recently. Use the lunch time around an hour to relieve the fatigue of working late the previous day and dining together. Most curtain guarantees private space. There is little risk of meeting superiors and juniors. Sleep cafes are thriving around the areas of Jongno and Gangnam in Seoul, where offices are concentrated. Some places even have 24-hour systems. Some people visit during late night hours to catch up on sleep, not to mention during lunchtime. A sleeping cafe in Gangnam visited last Tuesday at 1:00 p.m. When I turned to slippers in at the entrance, I found a dark and cozy atmosphere in the room. The ground floor was like a cave in the city. In front of the counter is a witty remark, "" All you are saved is sleep. "" When I said hello and asked for the bill, the front desk clerk took her index finger to her mouth and "" hissed "" it. As if to whisper, "" You can pay later, and I'll show you around. "" The walkway following the guide is equipped with curtains to divide the individual spaces. There is a wide beige leather bed. The clerk briefly explained how to operate the bed with the remote control, then closed the curtain and went back. To the right and left, they could hear the loud, small breath of nap. A hammock to replace a bed. For 15,000 won, you can get an 11-hour night ticket. Most sleeping cafes charge around 10,000 won. Some restaurants serve beverages based on the standard. Sleep cafes in Jongno are available for one hour at 6,000 won and offer one drink. You can take a nap on the couch or in a hammock instead of a bed. Some businesses even give people sleeping pants. You don't have to worry about sleeping in. If you say check-out time in advance, employees wake you up like an alarm. Roh Ung-hyun (45), co-representative of the G Sleep Cafe in Gangnam, said, We get 50 to 60 visitors a day on weekdays. Lunch time is mostly for office workers in their 20s and 30s. Recently, I am in my 40s and 50s. Because of 24-hour operation, I have many office workers who come from late hours to sleep, and teenagers who come from rural areas to see concerts and go back and forth. We plan to open our second store soon because sales were not bad after we opened last September, Roh added. According to the Shinhan Card Research Institute, as of June 2016, most people in the healing café were in their 20s, or 63 percent, when analyzing the data on Shinhan Card's use. The number of people in their 30s (199 percent) and 40s (209 percent) also increased sharply during the year. As the demand for lunchtime naps rises, multiplex theaters are also creating a new culture. CGV Yeouido in Seoul runs a siesta program every March to Thursday from noon to 1:00 p.m. Classical music, blankets, herbal tea, and slippers are provided for recliners that tilt 180 degrees. Cinema Turns into a Rest Space during Weekdays Lunch. [Photo Yeouido CGV] Because of the long work hours and corporate culture, experts point to the growing number of workers seeking ' happiness with 10,000 won ' at sleep cafes and cinemas. According to figures from the OECD last year, the average Korean slept 7 hours and 41 minutes a day, and 40 minutes less than the OECD average. Labor is the second longest working time in OECD countries after Mexico as of 2016. Compared to the overall average, she works 305 hours more than Japan, and 44 more days per year. The lives of "" working and sleeping "" Koreans also appear in coffee consumption. The annual coffee consumption per Korean adult is over 400 cups. The coffee market has also grown 9.3 percent per year since 2014. In Korea, we have a corporate culture that encourages us to hire at least a few people to do the best we can, said Kwon Soon-won, a professor of business administration at Sookmyung University in Seoul. In addition, it is difficult to say "" go out "" with the boss's hints and dinners are long. We can not afford to be productive, work long hours and sleep short. In Europe, we need to guarantee a regular break for the time being recently, said Kwon. It is designed to guarantee rest by setting consecutive breaks from work to work the next day. We need to discuss this as well as discuss ways to shorten the working hours. The sleep-deprived workers are heading for the sleeping cafe again today. As the ancient Greek poet Homeros sings, "" Sleeping is to cover up one's eyelids, to be good, to be evil, to forget everything, "" Korean employers accidentally wake up from stress by taking a nap. "" You know, sometimes people eat with you too much trouble. Sometimes even Bob is tired, "" said Aunt (29, Yeon-yi), a office worker who was at the entrance of a sleeping cafe and was getting ready to return to work in black shoes. "" When I do, I go to sleep in a sleeping cafe without thinking. "" Because I'm tired. Because I need to rest. Because I have to forget. Women's Daily Newspapers yu.sungkuk@joongang.co.kr [S BOX] bed mattresses alone are worth 1 trillion won, and the sleeponomics market place where sleeping is the latest word in synch and economics. As income increases, so does the amount and quality of sleep. The size of the sleep market analyzed by the distribution industry is also growing. According to the Korea Sleep Industry Association, the domestic sleep market, which has just begun growing, is about 2 trillion won. Industry analysts say Japan is worth 6 trillion won and the U.S. is worth 20 trillion won. In the past, simple sleep aids were mostly made by sleeping socks, scented candles and diffuser. Recently, beddings, food, and IT are also available to help people sleep better. According to the Korean Furniture Industry Association, the size of the Korean bed mattress market nearly doubled last year to more than 1 trillion won in more than a decade. Furniture industry officials say, Recently, a bed with a remote control to adjust the angle and even massage function is becoming popular. There is a growing interest in getting a good night's sleep. One manufacturer even launched a sleep experience consulting store. The store analyzes the customer's sleep patterns and posture and recommends products tailored to the sleep habit.

"# 1 European Thermal Efficiency House, moved to Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province, where 3 children live on a solar powered house with solar energy After witnessing an accident at Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan, it is hard to maintain trust in nuclear plants. However, can we eliminate nuclear plants that are responsible for one-third of our electricity production and use energy more cheaply? Alternative energy is still not economically viable, and the idea of increasing the proportion of fossil fuels is only a setback. The way out of this dilemma is actually simple and fundamental. We should abandon the idea that it is natural to use energy recklessly like it is now. If you laugh at the only energy saving campaign of the 1960s and 70s as the answer, let's introduce some of the people who would be ashamed to laugh at. Energy independence activists who produce their own energy, light their own, heat their own, and use their computers, are already not necessary and present in these energy communities, both large power generation industries and national transmission systems. Choi Woo-seok (left) and Choi Min-kyung, two brothers who live next to each other in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province, sat down with Min-kyung's second child, Ha Min-gun, in the living room of Woo-seok's brother Woo`s house. Outside temperatures were zero degrees, but inside temperatures were 26 degrees without heating. Yangpyeong : It is the first snow fall in the Seoul metropolitan area, which lasts 26 degrees without the use of heat, and at 4:00 p.m. on July 20, Hoehyeon-ri, Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do. I visited two two-story wooden houses where Choi Woo-seok (46) and Choi Min-kyung (40) live each. The temperature was zero degrees. However, Choi and her brother, who welcomed the reporter inside the Woo-seok house, were dressed in thin, short-sleeved clothes. The temperature inside the room is 26 degrees. But there was no bite when heated. I was surprised to hear that "" I didn't have any heating. "" What is more surprising is that they do not have any electricity meters at home. to have none Since Woo Suk first built and lived in a house in March 2013, he has never signed an electricity contract with KEPCO. It is an "" energy independent house "" that is maintained entirely by its own generated electricity. Two energy independent houses produce electricity with solar generators (5.5 ㎾, 5.3 ㎾) on walls and roofs and on the roof of the facility room. "" In general, when you have solar power at home, you send it to KEPCO's power grid, and you can use it to directly connect it to KEPCO's other electricity. "" But we don't need an inverter or an inverter.The Energy Independence House Overview of Choi Woo-seok and Choi Min-kyung's Brother's Energy Independence House and Photovoltaic Power Generation do not allow all houses to be self-sufficient. The energy efficiency of the house should be excellent. This is the secret of the house of my brother and sister. It is built with residential houses distributed in Europe, that is, houses complying with architectural standards regarding heat performance of buildings. If the average indoor temperature in winter is 20 ℃ and the annual demand for heating energy is less than or equal to 15 pyeongbangmiteoh per square meter (㎡), it is recognized as a residential house. Given that the heating energy requirement of a typical house is between 150 and 250 ㎾h per ㎡, consumption energy is only one tenth of that of a house. Insulation and confidentiality prevents heat from leaking in the room, and insulation is superior and sunlight is easily transmitted through three high-performance windows that are carried to the south to obtain the heat needed for heating. Also, add a ▦ heat recovery ventilation device designed to allow cold air entering from the air to take enough heat from the warm air exiting the room to minimize heat loss. The design stage excludes ▦ fever bridges, which is the spot where heat flows out from the interior, such as an apartment balcony or a broken area. This way, you can wear a shirt with only November sun without heating. Choi Woo-seok, the energy independent family member who has lived with solar energy for five years. "" When I lived in Seoul, I used to stay in my room and living room to save on heating costs. But you don't have to worry about that here. I don't have any problems with using all kinds of household appliances, including refrigerators, washing machines, TVs, and computers. I get very hot, but I can turn on only a small air conditioner in my room to cool the air down a little bit in the summer. Even in the summer, the temperature is not higher than 26 degrees Celsius. "" At first, they were able to live off of their own homes, but with their battery capacity decreasing little by little, they started using KEPCO's backup system in January 2015. Because there is no meter, KEPCO staff reads separately and pays several thousand won each. Still, the average energy self-sufficiency rate is 88 percent. Fassive House was not the answer to the massive power plant, said Fassive House in the early 1990s after architecture physicists such as Wolfgang Fiist of Germany raised the question of whether they would be able to cut back on energy consumption and enjoy comfortable lives. Real construction was carried out by those who participated in the energy conversion movement in the 2000s, and the German, British, and European councils implemented a system that requires the construction of new homes to be built in a Pacive House. In Korea, the first Zero Energy Housing Park entered Nowon-gu, Seoul, and 121 homes began to move in on July 20. The advantage of energy independence is not just that the electricity bill has gone away. Under the current centralized energy system, large power plants concentrated in a particular area produce electricity, send it via the high voltage power tower to the metropolitan area, and inevitably consume electricity during this process and the reverse. Energy anarchists question the order, which they believed was an optimised system for its size of economics and productivity. Choi Woo-seok explains the solar inverter (yellow box) and the battery inverter (red box), which handles electricity made from solar energy. Yangpyeong : How about making energy and storing it in batteries in every town and then sharing the remaining electricity with your neighbors or creating a micro grid? Choi Woo-seok, Choi Woo-seok, director of the Department of Energy, said, "" As we save money for maintaining the gigantic grid system nationwide, the citizens will be able to use the new and cheaper renewable energy sources of Seoul National University's independent schools in 2009. "" I was also tired of traveling around Seoul looking for cheap rental places. It is impossible to make a living at home on a salary basis in Seoul, and even though it is difficult to find a house, I live in hot and cold weather, worrying about the gas bill. Rather, I found Yangpyeong where I could commute to Seoul, "" Min-kyung, who was serving as a food expert, was persuaded by his brother to come to Yangpyeong. "" I wanted to let my children live in the house in the yard, but I didn't know how, and I was moved by your suggestion. It also means that it helps protect the environment. "" They bought 156 pyeong of land (about 515 ㎡) for 130 million won. The first energy independence house, the home of his brother, cost 140 million won in construction. Instead of investing in insulation, three-windows, batteries, and inverters, they saved on floor insulation or exterior materials. Heo Kyung-ja, CEO of Daekyeong Engineering, explains his Seoguipo home, E-House, which is designed to only live on solar powered electricity. Behind the scenes, they are charging the electric car's motor pool with electricity saved from solar power. Heo Gyeong-ja, the CEO of Daekyeong Engineering, a smart grid company, completed an energy independent house named "" e-house "" in Gangjeong-dong, Seogwipo, Jeju last May. The two-story house with 128 pyeong (approximately 423 ㎡) has been equipped with Pacive House technology and uses 13- ㎾ solar generator to provide basic energy. The name e-house is an expression of willingness to live solely on electricity made from solar power. The roof itself of the e-house is a huge solar panel. "" When you install a solar generator on the roof, you can see people who do not like the look of a solar panel because it sticks out onto the roof. There is no problem with the building integrated PV panel because it has no roof at all, so it says, "" We installed three solar powered solar powered solar powered solar cars into the Samsung Electro-Character. The electric car chargers that are often available in the evenings mostly use electricity generated from fossil energy. A charger with a capacity of 7 ㎾ can be charged for five to six hours, and an electric car can be charged for 10 hours. When I returned from my old Seogwipo house by gasoline truck from my office in Jeju Island, it cost 500,000 won per month, but now I have to use my home charged electric car to drive home. I wanted to show people that new and renewable energy can support themselves. Building materials including solar panels, ESS, windows, windscreens and insulation were all domestic small and medium sized businesses. "" The energy conversion zone in Seoul's Jongdong district is comprised of three or four energy bars. We should look for ways to live away from nuclear plants since the Fukushima nuclear crisis began in 2011, "" adding, "" As residents informed of the various energy conversion activities including the ' energy saving station ' and the ' energy supermarket, ' they said. Founded in 2015, the Jongdaegol Village Energy Research Center (Living Lab) features 49 residents who work as researchers. Use less fossil energy."
"While studying every method to make higher use of renewable energy, one of the main themes of the study was why solar was neglected in central Seoul. Researchers at Ribinglab, a town in Seoul's Chongdong-gol district, install a mini-hot-solar generator on the rooftop of an energy supermarket Monday. The key was the cost of installing the solar panels, said Shin Sang-soon, a senior reporter at Kyung-kyung's Valley Village President. Even with subsidies from the Seoul Metropolitan Government and the Dongjak-gu Office, 90,000 to 100,000 won to 100,000 won needed to be covered by mercy, but many were reluctant to do so. So I went to the Chairman of Motion Sinhoi Association and persuaded him to make a financial product for installing solar panels. Our family Solaron was born when researchers and Shin put their heads together and raised money to close the fund at 10 million won. The 300-watt mini-solar can be installed for 22 months without interest, but the electricity bill can be cut by more than 5,000 won if the house pays 30,000 won per month.The theme that we have been focusing on lately is the DIY Mini-Hyund project. It often costs more to install the panels than the panel price (25,000 won), and it will be reduced by reducing the panel size and using a picture-oriented manual, allowing non-specialists to install them themselves. A solar panel maker, Micro-Power Power Plant (CEO, Lee Ki-kwan), developed a DIY panel in early July that reflects researcher's suggestion to connect panels and home wires without breaking through walls. About 20 households have already installed the panels themselves. Housewives or elderly citizens in their 70s learn at a workshop at the Energy Research Institute and can easily get to school in one or two hours. After installation, maintenance order out the team researchers to solve the energy researchers. One of the reasons why subsidized solar panels are not used later is that they lack an AS system to cope with major and minor failures or replacement of parts, and this is why Bangdaegol Village is a success. About 20 people started an energy independence movement in Jindanggol Village seven years ago. Now more than 4,000 people are joining. "" With one mini-solar generation in the city, you can't get energy independence. But many agree to reduce fossil energy in the future. And you can bring together these individuals to create a big flow. Someday, it will be a force to move the local governments or the government. "" Who said, "" Repealing nuclear plants is naive, we don't have enough renewable energy, and energy independence is impossible. "" Energy independence activists are already pioneering an energy world. Young-kyodo : Park Sang-jun, a reporter at buttonpr@hankookilbo.com Police said Monday that they received a 112 notice that a man had broken into the M building in the residential area of Jeong, a Gangnam district, Seoul, at 3:05 p.m. The police immediately went to the scene, received the suspects seized the parent (44), under investigation. Lee allegedly pretended to be a delivery engineer, climbed to the floor where Jeong lived, and stabbed the man who was with Chung. A is being transferred to hospital for treatment. Lee reportedly stated to the police that he had a financial relationship with Chung. Police are investigating Lee for the exact cause of the crime. As a beneficiary of the corruption scandal surrounding the entrance examination to Ewha Womans University, Chung helped independent counsel and prosecution to avoid arrest. pulse@yna.co.kr ▶ Information and inquiry (Click!) ▶ At the China Tech [China's Passing Over Korea's Consumer Electronics Show], we're shooting Starbucks Coffee [China Tech].

"Why? What is Pyeongchang Long padding? Is it just a coincidence? I think it would be great if you buy the clothes you want to buy and bundle up. Is the idea of ' wanting to buy ' purely consumer? It contains such worries."" Pyeongchang Longpadding "" is a dawn-drawn, fluffy, and "" Super Waste … Reducing Profit-taking. "" SNS is saying, "" Please, you can't afford to buy back the short list. "" Mr. A, who was sitting on the top of ticket 11, said, "" I've been sitting down since nine-thirty last night. "" `` The first minute arrived at 8 in the evening, '' he said. It was the last day that 500 extra units of "" Pyeongchang Long Padding "" were sold at Lotte Department Store in Yeongdeungpo. As the first major ticket was distributed to 200 buyers after standing in line on July 18, the company had the opportunity to purchase only 300 more Pyeongchang Longpadds. Barricads were taped around people sitting or standing on the number tags from one to 300. It was nearly 10:30 a.m. One or two people who were sitting at the entrance of Lotte Department Store in Yeongdeungpo Station on Subway Line No. 1 for at least 6 hours and at least 14 hours got up. Some people took their cell phones out and listened. He took a photo with a number on the floor. There was a sense of achievement saying that he had done something that nobody could do. Lotte Department Store's Yeongdeungpo branch announced three days ago that it would distribute the number of tickets to the first 300 on a first-come-first-served basis starting at 10:30 a.m. About 300 people were "" closed "" at 4:30 a.m., 6 hours before the tickets were distributed. The situation at Lotte Department Store in Jamsil, Gimpo Airport and Pyeongchon, which sold Pyeongchang long padding along with Yeongdeungpo Store, was similar. How can you kill the family? PyeongChang Long padding began selling at stores late last month by its official 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics partner Lotte Department Store. The full name of the product is the ‘ Guss Longdown ’, which means long padding (down) made of goose hair. It is manufactured by Korean companies Sinseong Trading Company, which manufactures clothing for global brands using OEM, only has a total of 30,000 units. There are no brand names that reveal manufacturers or retailers (Lotte Department Store) in padding. Pyeongchang's Olympic slogan, ' Passion.Connect. ' is only written on the left arm and back. PyeongChang Long padding, one of just a few Olympic souvenirs, began to soar in early November. The number of ' sunfluens ' left in the entertainment and community by the people who bought padding has increased. The stores were sold out and re-entered repeatedly. "" I didn't expect it because of the price, but last year it wasn't cheap or warm when I bought it early 100,000 won. (…) It's foolish not to buy at this price. "" "" (After leaving it online at the Pyeongchang Olympics), Lotte Department Store's "" Pyeongchang Long Padding "" advertising flyer was the main reason for the craze. "" Pyeongchang Longpadding costs 149,000 won. There are many long padding books with around 150,000 won. The difference in price is determined first by the filler (thermos), and using artificial fibers such as goose or duck, can significantly reduce the cost of production. Most long-padded children under 100,000 won use a wellon or polyester as a filling. The reason why Pyeongchang Long Padding is honored is because it kept the price at 100,000 won even though it used 80 percent of goose fuzz and 20 percent of feather as filler. In general, goose fur is more expensive because it is known to be more heatable than duck fur. Also, the wool on the chest is more heatable than the feather attached to the wings, so the higher the specific gravity of the wool, the higher the price. Other brands of long padding are sold for 300,000 to 500,000 won, such as Pyeongchang Longpadding. Usually, we can`t make the products that represent the Olympics cheaper than the ones that were cheaper, said Yeom Tae-soon, chairman of the Shinseong Trading Center in Pyeongchang.(November 21) The holy trade official said, "" Goose down, lining and exterior were used as premium material. We lowered the price by reducing the profit rather than cutting the unit price, explained Kang. The selling price consists of the ‘ unit price plus margin ’, which means that the margin has been reduced as much as possible. Of course, the same goose fur costs different depending on where it was made. "" I guess goose fur from cold areas is very expensive, "" said an official from an outdoor goods company. Polish or Hungarian duck-haired fur is more expensive than Chinese. Prices also vary depending on the type of feeling you make and how much manual it takes to finish it, it added. These are not included in the product description. The new trade deal is so big that it can be produced at a different level than other Korean brands, he said. The company can come up with various strategies to reduce unit prices and lower margins, the official explained. As word spread that the price of temporary gifts was good, the weather got colder when interest grew. According to figures from the Korea Meteorological Administration, the average temperature of Seoul has dropped from around 15 degrees by the end of October to 10 degrees Celsius for the first time since November 4, and has dropped below 5 degrees since November 15. Compared to last year, the warm weather in a short period of time has turned into winter. In the clothing industry, it is said that "" the weather is more important than the advertising model to sell winter clothes. "" Early cold weather, more effective than advertising, brought people together."" Pyeongchang Long Padding "" Letter, posted November 22 in front of Lotte Department Store's Yeongdeungpo branch. It started to spread in its teens and 20s, called "" bench parkas "". Gwajam, ' which is usually custom made and worn by university students, has also become a part of the trend, taking longer to make. Bench-packas, like their name, were commonly worn by athletes. It was for athletes who had to stay warm before and after their replacement while waiting on the bench. Because of the heavy workload, soccer and basketball players who sweat a lot compared to other sports. For those who need to wear thin uniforms but don't know when to get into the uniforms, the warm bench parka was useful. For the same reason, many performers with outdoor pictures or singers who were about to perform enjoyed wearing them. Longpadding has become more popular among teenagers and those in their 20s, among other things, with the "" role "" of celebrities, including idol groups. It is because they have begun posting long-padded photos of celebrities worn for practical purposes on their programs. Fans who saw the photo entered "" ○ ○ ○ padding "" in the portal windows. The process was not something that clothing companies could simply watch. An official at a clothing company said, Many times, they are sponsored by clothing that is put on the entertainment companies ` shelves or exposed by news pictures. Some conditions are even added to the contract, such as exposure to the system more than once a month. The Pyeongchang Long Padding craze has been completed with celebrities joining the fiery Long Padding fad (ultimately by businesses) and the "" High Proportions "" plus a "" limited edition. "" If you're overweight, you won't have to search the Internet for long-padding in a similar price range with similar specifications to Pyeongchang Long padding. But the padding doesn't sell like hot cakes. Event Store started in front of Lotte Department Store in Yeongdeungpo on July 22. It is a store where department store owners sell back merchandise or inventory on sale in front of entrance doors. There was also a long padding at the event's store. He used duck fur as a filling material and the price was 90,000 won. When it comes to obesity, it is not as bad as Pyeongchang Longpadding, but people showed little interest in it. A woman in her fifties, less than 300, took a picture and sent Katok to her daughter. "" Do you want some of this? "" "" No. "" said artist columnist Lee Dong-seop, "" For teenagers who wait in line all night in front of the department store, Pyeongchang Long Padding is a limited edition. In an age when money is everything to pay for, the limited edition of ' You Can't Buy Again ' is valuable. The value of the limited edition grows as it leads to the culture of placing such purchased items on one of their NSAs to certify them. If you look at the Pyeongchang Olympics ' official online store, you will see some products with a large emblem, hood tea, and many other items on them are also sold out. That is why columnist Lee Dong-seop said, The Pyeongchang Long Padding boom won`t prompt other brands to increase their sales. That is because the ready-made articles do not give the pleasure of limited edition. Still, some companies ' long padding is out of stock. It appears that the process has drawn more attention as the media has highlighted the process as an article, which has been repeatedly sold out and re-entered. This is also a characteristic of fast fashion - the clothing industry that produces and distributes trends quickly. Uniqlo and H&M are major fast fashion brands. Of course, as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) generalize, the distinction between fast fashion and non-faster fashion has become blurred. In his paper, ' Fast Fashion Studies Through the Understanding of Contemporary Consumption Society ' (Yoon TaI-young, Roh Ji-yeon, Goh Ae-ran, August 2014), which analyzes ' limitations ' not necessarily as the characteristic of fast fashion and says ' there are not many products left in the mind. ' It then stated, "" with the style icons of the day or in collaboration with famous designers, a limited number of restricted products were published, constantly highlighting individuality and the desire for social differentiation (differentiation) from others. "" This means that the fashion industry creates and encourages the value of limited edition. The ‘ vigil ’ disturbance is typical when Achen&M, the global spa brand (SPA), collaborated with the high-end brand ‘ Balmant ’ in November 2015. Humans and animals,"
"Fashion for the Environment While we are crazy about Pyeongchang Long Padding, we have many issues to ignore or hide. Before discussing the cost of padding, the problem of cruelty to animals in the process of producing padding equipment should be addressed. Each padding has between 15 and 20 geese and ducks. Starting from the tenth week of age, hair is extracted alive every six weeks. The Greenpeace report ' Timeout for fast fashion ' shows that global clothing sales increased from $ 1 trillion in 2002 to nearly $ 1.8 trillion in 2015 (approximately $ 2000 trillion). While the average clothing purchase has increased by 60 percent from 15 years ago, it has become twice as fast to abandon, the report said. Today's Trash of today is the trend. The "" Holy House of Trade, "" which is built in Pyeongchang's long padding, includes clothing company V.I.P., the parent company of the North Face, and the British low-cost spa brand PrIMARK. They are the leading fast fashion companies and global clothing chaebols who make their money by selling "" rubbish of tomorrow. "" Would humans be safe from cruelty to animals and destruction of the environment? Polyester production, used in 60 % of all fibres, releases three times as much carbon as cotton. Clothes made of synthetic fibers release invisible fine plastic during the wash. Citing research by a university research team in September 2016, Britain's < Guardian > reported that "" up to 700,000 plastic fibers are emitted when washing a suit. "" British activist and journalist Tansey Hoskins wrote in his book, Capitalism on Runway, about the "" Unforgettable Search for Profit "" that little respect for humans, animals, or the environment was found. Growing up, exploiting poor workers and their customers severely, the fashion industry has abused animals and destroyed the environment. And they are eventually threatening everyone's survival.

"As the number of people who need to get back on their feet when it is hard to make ends meet increased by shamanist or calendar holders during the year of recession, they can not afford to pay more job security for aging society. As a result, they have to pay millions of won per academy. The industry attributes the downturn to the biggest reason. When it is difficult to make ends meet, many women are working as shamans or retreats who have virtually no barriers to enter the country, including degrees or certificates. A similar phenomenon has occurred in the IMF financial crisis.According to the Association of Korean New Technicians and the Korea Post-Technician Association, the two groups have the highest number of members with approximately 500,000 and non-members, respectively. The number of shamans who joined the Korea Shinheon Federation 11 years ago was 140,000 in 2006 and that of reactionaries has doubled to 200,000 over the past 10 years. Add to the estimates of non-members by the associations, and you can guess that there are one million shamans and retreats.The purpose of the shaman and the counterparters is similar, but different. The shaman stands for ‘ a person who marks the road to God's service and, as a result, prophesies for the purpose of good and good. ’ It usually refers to women and men call it applause or applause shamans. In contrast, the retreationists use Oriental philosophies such as the leading role and the study of the Ming dynasty as a punchline, or a coronary outlook on the future.According to the 2011 Korean Cultural Center Miner, a one-million-year-old Buddhist academy, the number of clergy in Korea were 148,483 Protestants, 499,500 Buddhists and 10,508 Catholics. They are classified as religious workers, and shamans and possessors are included in the service. It is a job that provides future forecast services to religious people with "" Folklore Temple "" and "" Fortune Thoughters. ""Cho Seong-je, director of Mucheon Culture Institute, who has studied shamanism for 30 years, said, "" When the economy is bad, the number of restaurants often go into recession. "" But the number of ladybugs and retreats who retired increases as jobs increases. He also said, "" I often get kicked out when I'm injured. I can see my family going bankrupt, and I can see my family going bankrupt because it's hard to do that. ""The philosophy institute at the Korea Institute of Dynamics and Technology is offering a ' shortcut to being a mechanic '. ' It is a lifelong career PR and stability for the jobless and aging society. ' The school is divided into two classes at night and teaches four major subjects : nephrology, coronary science, and the leading. "" The number of students who attend each course is steady at around 20, and the number of office workers who prepare for work and home at home during the day, and those who are about to retire at night is also increasing, "" an official at the institute said.The Hanyang Arts and Sciences Conservation Society in Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul teaches the mentally challenged how to make a exorcism. It is divided into two classes : the beginner's and the second graders ' class, and the dance moves and lines of Janggu, which are celebrated in Seoul for 3-12 months. Professor Kang Young-im, who is the intangible cultural asset No. 104 ' Soulsaengnamgut, ' said, "" We received a lecture, but we still have 2,000 students who did not know the basics of good. "" Other places open to shamanism research institutes, shamanism institutes, and electric water stations, and teach local customs, some of which cost millions of won per month. One dance executive said, "" Even the undeclared enter the gutterboard on rumors of receiving millions to tens of millions of won at a time. "" "" Even the ones with poor work skills learn as assistants. ""The shaman who is still called Sunmudang is usually raised to be an apprenticeship. A senior shaman, called ' Father of God, Mother of God, ' teaches a shaman rite called Andonggut. The cost of receiving Naerimgut once varies from region to region, but tens of millions of won is basic. After naringgut, people often ask for money, saying, "" Good luck "" or, "" God did not come down properly due to lack of care, "" and therefore, it is often the case that Sin Bu-mo and Shin children separate.Busan Western Police arrested Seo (31) on July 17 on suspicion of beating up one of her colleagues Seo (27), who was staying at a tarot location, to death. Seo, who broke his leg after leaving the military for an unknown reason, paid 20 million won last October to visit a tarot store in Busan and did not pay anything, ' Shin said. Seok-ri, a colleague of mine, said, "" I don't exercise and I haven't got the will to do this. "" She was used to assault Seo repeatedly and kill him. "" My aunt, who was being charged with bridge recovery, "" she said. "" The idea of allowing people to come to God "" is something that is not clear in itself, "" Cho Sung-je said, adding, "" The rite of worship, including good deeds, must be taught for many years to come. ""As the problem was repeated, there was a book that suggested how to be represented as ' Do It Yourself '. Chae Seong-hun, author of Naerimgut's Treacher of Taoism and Shamanism, said, "" According to our folklore, it is clear that people who are destined to serve God are subject to fraud, and that they need good luck. ""Kim Yoo-jin (34), who started to take advantage of the party's fortune last July when he opened a lecture hall in Gangbuk-gu, Seoul, became a shaman by himself. Kim went to the bathroom to become a shaman after suffering from a three-year illness while working as a office worker, hairdresser and others. "" I paid several tens of millions of won to be accepted as a priest, but I have not recovered, and I have since been watching my memorial services as I pray and perform by myself, "" Kim said.Some are concerned that Shamans will not be succeeded by traditional folk culture but instead turn into money-hunting jobs.

"South Korean defector Lim Ji-hyun is reintroducing for the Korean National Security Council. Considering the North Korean authorities ' attitude toward defectors, it is widely expected that they will soon launch a series of harsh criticisms against Oh.First of all, North Korea has no choice but to monitor Oh's health through South Korean media. North Korea is very sensitive to the detractors slandering the North Korean regime, a South Korean official said, It is very disturbing when the news is revealed to the North Koreans. Furthermore, in the case of high-level and military defection, North Korea is striving desperately to undermine its credibility by talking about its regime.When former North Korean ambassador to Britain Taeyeongho defected last December, the North Korean media accused him of stealing state funds, and then threatened to punish the North for allegedly stealing money from the South, and even charged him with rape. Tae-young`s comments also discourage Tae`s criticism of the North Korean regime, Tae-young-ho said.The same is true of Lim Ji-hyeon (North Korean name Jeon Hye-seong), a former defector who allegedly entered North Korea last August. Through North Korea`s propaganda media, Lim said he chose to exaggerate lies that match with defectors ` groups and anti-Communist propaganda broadcasts. He even made a personal attack citing the names of the people who appeared on the show with him. As a result, North Korea is likely to show a similar attitude toward Oh, who defected through the middle of the border. He is already represented as a North Korean soldier, with all of our people`s attention, an unnamed South Korean official said, North Korean authorities will denigrate his defection and background. If Oh raises the blame on the poor North's economic situation, North Korea can distort the motives of his defection.On the other hand, North Korea can adjust its tone based on the overall inter-Korean relationship. Until recently, the North has not completely closed the door to improvement of inter-Korean relations, refusing to hold back any raw criticism of its regime. It is predicted that the slander against Oh will not expand enough to affect the relationship between the two Koreas.Jooyoungbin Correspondent peoplepeople@hankookilbo.com As the hunter disposed of the game and ate the rest of the meat, the wolf step by step approached the hunter. After a long time, the wolf and the hunter went on a deer and wild boar hunt. It has turned from a wolf to a dog.The oldest painting of a dog starting to live with a human was found. Dr. Maria Guagnin of the Max Planck Institute for Human History and History in Germany announced in the latest issue of the journal Anti-Archaeology Journal that humans have hunted dogs tied to a leash in the Saudi Arabian desert.Dr. Guagnin has spent the past three years investigating the status of Jubbah and Shuwaymis, two of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites along with the Saudi National Tourism Heritage Committee. It is presumed that this was a riverside. Around 1400 rock paintings depicting 7,000 animals were found on rock cliffs.Rock paintings found at the Shuweimis ruins in Saudi Arabia. They are drawn with bow hunters and dogs tied to strings./ The dog in Max Planck Institute for Cancer in Germany is expressing the white shape of the shoulder (Planck Institute for Human History in Germany), similar to the Caenan dog (upper) in today's Middle East. Archaeologists think hunters began living in the area 10,000 years ago. It was presumed that the plump woman at the foot of the rock painted it during this time. People began to raise livestock between 7,000 and 8000 years ago. Many of the livestock remains were recovered from the Juba ruins, and the animals painted on the upper part of the cliff were mainly cattle, sheep and goats.Dogs hunted with humans can be found among ancient women and livestock paintings. There are 156 dogs carved into the swaimie, and 193 dogs carved into the juba. Dogs are all about the size of middle ears, pointed up and their tails dried up. It is reminiscent of a Korean Jindo dog, which is the ancestor of a local Canaan dog. Ancient people even expressed the white fur on the shoulders and chest of Keenan dogs.The age of the production of the rock print painting is difficult to ascertain with accuracy. If you find a skeleton, you can measure its age with the carbon inside it, but it can not because it is a mineral. Instead, it was presumed to have been painted at a time when hunting and gathering changed to ranching, based on the order in which the paintings were painted. Dr. Guagnin said, "" It appears to have been made at least 8000 to 9000 years ago, "" which is way ahead of a dog drawing of a ceramic dog from 8,000 years ago in Iran.Some people have shown reservations, saying, "" We can not finalize the age of the rock paintings. "" However, there is no doubt that it is the first time that a dog has been strapped down. Until now, Egyptian murals were the oldest paintings of dogs tied to strings."" The picture of Mokjul tied to the hunter's waist shows that he had to use both hands to shoot an arrow, "" the researchers explained. Some argue that the leash is not a leash, as it is today, but a symbol of bond between humans and dogs. However, bonding is already a sign of homestead.Then when were wolves domesticated as dogs? Scientists analyze the DNA of existing dogs, wolves, and fossils, and believe that dogs appeared at least 15,000 to 40,000 years ago. The area where the dog first appeared is also divided. Scientists in the early 2000s chose Southeast Asian dogs as the source of their dogs because they have the least genetic diversity. However, since then, wolves in the Middle East had the most similar DNA to dogs today, creating the rumor of a Middle East origin. Recently, there was even a rumor that it originated in Siberia.There is also a theory of revenge. Last year, researchers at Oxford University in the United Kingdom extracted nuclear DNA from dogs ' remains 5,000 years ago. Compared to the 605 breeds of dogs today, the researchers drew a schematic diagram of how dogs evolved. Dogs were largely divided into European and Asian ones. The time of separation is estimated to be 64,000 to 14,000 years ago. The researchers said it was evidence that dogs were domesticated separately in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.Lee Young-wan, a scientific reporter at ywlee@chosun.com][ - Copyright ⓒ Chosun Ilbo & Chosun.com, No Uncommissioned copies and redistribution -"
"[China Tech [Dominance of Transliteration] : China's nuclear power shuttle that took the lead in the world science and technology field in 2040, developed nuclear facilities from asteroids to mineral mining, and created the world's largest radio telescope last year ... Nobel Prize winner of science prize is leading Britain (6.0 percent), the world's second largest and chasing the United States, the world's undisputed No.1. China is the only one among the top 10 countries to have increased its share of scientific papers in the past decade. Some say China has already caught up with the U.S. in the quality and influence of its papers. The journal Nature said in September that China's Academy of Sciences contributed the most to publishing an important research paper last year. Second place was at Harvard University in the U.S. China has become a scientific powerhouse that stands shoulder to shoulder with aggressive investment, its ambition to be the world`s best, and its constant innovations, Nature said.China, which had been busy catching up with advanced nations such as the U.S., Europe, and Japan, has now moved up to the leading edge in all fields of science and technology, from basic science such as physics and chemistry to applied science such as communication and computer.◇ Space, Quantum Communication, and SuperCom … China announced on July 18 that it planned to beat the U.S. into becoming the world's top space power by 2045. It is said that it plans to build a base on the moon by 2030 after the development of the space freighter in 2025. It also announced that it will build nuclear propulsion space shuttle and space and solar plant that can mine minerals from asteroids by 2040. China launched its space rocket 22 times last year, beating Russia 17 times and being the same as the U.S. Some analyze that the technology of producing space rockets and satellites is similar to or even more advanced than that of the U.S.China National Science and Technology Observatory completed Tianyan's, the largest radio telescope in Guizhou Castle in September last year with 30 super-sized soccer stadiums. It is more than twice the size of America's largest Arecibo Observatory telescope and has a detection capacity of 2.25 times higher. Tian Yan is catching many tiny cosmic signals that have not been detected before, said Lee Seo-koo, head of the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, adding that China is one step closer to identifying the mystery of the birth of the universe than the United States.China has also surpassed the U.S., the birthplace of computers. China took up 202 of the 500 supercomputers that were announced at the World Supercom Potting Conference on July 13, beating the U.S. (143) for the first time. China's Sunway Taihurite, the world's fastest calculating country, has more than five times the performance of America's top Titan. Last May, Southern China succeeded in mining for its own solid natural gas (methane hydrate) called the burning ice, and it is also doing well in future energy development. China is also rapidly expanding its influence on quantum communication, material science, and the development of new medicines. China is already leading the way so that Korea and Japan can not catch up, said Kim Young-duk, head of the underground science research team at Korea Basic Research Institute.◇ China is also concentrating on recruiting excellent scientists from its basic science field. The Chinese government has offered extra money (approximately 170 million won) and hundreds of millions of dollars in annual salary to world-class scientists since 2008. According to the OECD, the number of Ph.D.-level Park from the U.S. to China reached 39,977 from 2006, exceeding the number of Koreans going from China to the U.S.As a result of the Chinese government's policy to foster scientists, many international researchers are being produced. China (237) scored in the third round of the World's most influential 1 % scientist in 2017, recently announced by paper analyst Claverse Analitics, in the United States of America (1661). In particular, China showed a 34 percent rise, the fastest growing country in the world. There were only 28 South Koreans. As China has begun to actively recruit talented people, Chinese scientists abroad have begun to say that returning home is the top priority, especially in China.○ Comprications : Chosun Ilbo & Chosun.com, Transportee and Redistribution in Suwon Metropolitan Hospital Though the trauma center is overcrowded, the number of patients in the hospital is limited to hospital rooms and staff. The Regional trauma center at Aju University Hospital in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, was full of 40 beds at 8:40 a.m. yesterday. We can not receive more patients, the National Medical Center said. Nevertheless, patients were transferred from Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province. Since its official opening in June last year, the Aju University Center has been suffering from a sharp increase in trauma. The patient room is so full that it is not easy to miss. Kim Ji-young, manager of the trauma program, complains, It does not work even if I ask for more room. The Regional trauma center at Busan National University Hospital recently had two trauma surgeons stop. If you work on the watch every three days, your biological rhythms get broken and your physical strength declines, said Cho Hyun-min, who is left over from the rest of us because it is so hard to do so. Even if we start with a sense of duty, we will give up unless we get enough reward, Cho added. Lee Guk-jong, head of the Korea Center for Health and Human Resources Development, was sent to the helipad at a late hour. According to the 2018 budget proposal submitted to the National Assembly, the budget for establishing a serious trauma care system was 40 billion to 40 billion won, down 8.9 percent from 43.6 billion won this year. The budget decreased by 7.8 percent compared to last year, and this is the second year in a row. We have cut back due to the useless budget of the 2016 trauma center, said a ministry official. Of the 101 billion won in wasted budget, 5.6 billion won remained due to the inability of the center to hire doctors. The trauma center provides 8 billion won for initial installation, and 700-7.7 billion won (mostly doctors ' fees) for annual operating expenses. Each specialist in charge will receive up to 120 million won. It is not intended to support all physicians. If five doctors are applied for the national medical examination, hospitals will have to provide one with funds. Because of this, the hospital's trauma center has 18 doctors who are in charge, but only 12 receive state support. The work force of trauma center doctors is unimaginable. They are on night watch for 12 hours every three days. Do regular treatment instead of go home the next morning. Repeat this pattern. The same goes for nurses. Kim Ji-young, manager of Aju University Hospital said, I have never been home since I defected from North Korea on July 13. I sleep in a cot. "" I see two or three patients at a time, and it is hard for me to wake up when I hear an emergency signal, "" says a nurse at the intensive care unit. The turnover of hospital nurses at Azu University is 35 %. Lee Guk-jong, head of the Center for Korean Studies, holds a news conference at Aju University Hospital on July 22 to explain the status of North Korean soldiers who have defected from the DMZ. Park Jong-keun, a reporter at the Korea Media Center, is also in a terrible mood. Patients are always open to the public because they do not know where they were injured, said Lee Kook-jong, head of the Center. Find the bleeding and damaged area, wipe out, and sew it up. You should also touch the microangiomenia. "" Still, the government recognizes only one hundred percent of the treatment area and 70 percent of the cost in the other. The rest do not approve. As a result, they avoid the trauma center. That is why there are no trauma centers in Seoul and Gyeongnam. The hospital center of Ajudae University is packed with patients not only from Kyung-gi but also from Chungchong and Seoul. Cho Hyun-min, chairman of the Korean Credit Association (Busan National University Hospital's Regional trauma Center), told prosecutors on how to deal with the situation. Q : Is there a serious manpower shortage?A : It is difficult to secure expert manpower with experience and knowledge. There is a shortage of young doctors to support trauma surgery. There are six people in the hospital. When all 17 major trauma centers are opened, 391 trauma doctors are needed. There were only 228 people out in 2010 and 2016. Half of them stop because they are tired. Q : Is it a deficit?A : The hospital's trauma center in Busan University went into deficit of 2 billion won last year and was filled with government support. The government does not provide labor to support personnel (emergency rescue workers, nurses, etc.) other than doctors. Half of new nurses stop within a year. Surgical costs (in numbers) should be 5 to 10 times larger than normal patients. The number of people who have agreed to the Presidential petition to support the trauma center has exceeded 200,000 in a week. Meanwhile, more than 200,000 people have agreed to increase the support for the trauma center in a week. Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon instructed the ministry to identify the trauma center's problems and consider ways to improve them.

Sohn Dae-seong, a reporter at Pohang University of Science and Technology, will close next week. However, some parents are complaining that the restoration is not complete. According to the National Education Support Agency in Pohang, all schools in Pohang temporarily closed down after the earthquake on July 15, but are gradually rescheduling their academic schedules. There were 29 schools that closed on July 20, but the number of schools decreased to eight, including one middle school, six elementary schools, and one private kindergarten on July 24. Starting July 27, all schools except Jangseong Elementary School (including Byungseol Kindergarten) will normalize their academic schedules. Jangseong Elementary School is in the middle of repair work because of relatively high earthquake damage.▽ Maintenance marks (Pohang = Yonhap news) = Inside Jangseong Elementary School in Jangseong-dong, Buk-gu, Pohang-si, Gyeongbuk, Korea The school was damaged by the earthquake on July 15. Jangseong Elementary School in Jangseong-dong, Buk-gu, Pohang City, was divided into several areas by the earthquake. External bricks are cracked with an X, and many of them have damaged concrete pieces and finishes on walls and ceilings. One of the pillars in particular is such that some of the steel structures were revealed due to the concrete being dropped. Because of this, the school is currently repairing the cracked areas and reinforcing columns. It will also conduct a thorough examination for another month. The school said it found that when it was taken out of the box, the inside walls had small cracks, but there were no structural problems. Therefore, if the results of an intermediate safety diagnosis are found to be safe, he or she explained it to the parents ' representative on July 27 and decided to normalize the academic schedule from July 29. We received the results of an inspection that there were no structural problems except for a single pillar, a school official said, We will finally decide whether to normalize the program based on the announcement of interim results of the companies that gave precise diagnosis. However, some parents oppose the school's plan to close the doors, saying they can not trust building safety. One student mother said, "" I haven't got any healthy walls, and I don't have a lot of asbestos in my roof, and I don't want to rush to resume classes because I don't think about student safety.

Photo : Yonhap News Agency reporter Lee Nam-Nam-Nam is focusing on the Bank of Korea. The central bank`s Monetary Policy Committee will decide the key interest rate on July 30.The committee is especially paying keen attention this month on possible rate hikes. As a result of a recent survey of 10 economists and financial experts, seven expect the central bank to raise the key interest rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.50 percent. Most of all, the recovery is on the horizon. A possible rise in U.S. base rates next month is also a factor that makes people predict a rise this month. Household debt growth has decreased but remained flat.The rate has not risen by the central bank in the past six and a half years since June 2011 (3.00 % → 3.25 %). It is just as unusual. If the central bank makes a surprise move, it will also symbolize that it is the first step toward the normalization of monetary policies.As a result, the market is also likely to be unanimous. That means all seven members of the committee will vote for an increase.The financial market is in a tense mode. The bond market is already on the alert, reflecting the central bank's rise on the price. Interest rates have already risen to 2.169 percent for the past three years. The foreign exchange market is also paying keen attention. The recent pressure on the won`s super-increasion could be stronger by means of raising the benchmark rate. The won-dollar exchange rate has dropped to the mid-1800s.Chairman Lee Joo-yeol will also make comments at a news conference after deciding on the key interest rate.

"[Graphic] People who were just laid off from work status are not unemployed, but the citizens who are supposed to ask for the most unemployment benefits due to the rising number of elderly people due to the aging population (Seong-Dae Union) It is analyzed that the job market is still very little in order to revive the economy. According to the National Statistical Office yesterday, the number of economically inactive people who were classified as "" rested "" in October totaled 1,163,000, up 15.5 percent from the same month last year. It was the largest number since October 2003 when statistics were first compiled. October was also the biggest month in two and a half years since April 2015 when the nation saw its population grow by 16.7 percent. Rest is not people who are capable of working or suffering from a serious illness, but who simply do not want to "" relax "". Although they are not classified as statistical jobless because they are not included in the economically active population, they are more likely to fall into unemployment or abandon their jobs altogether. Such an increase in the number of "" idle "" people is attributable to a combination of factors such as an increase in the elderly population and worsening employment conditions for youths.The population was off by all ages in October, with the elderly aged 60 and older (21.4 %) and the young aged 15-29 (18.4 %) especially high. The jobless population in their 50s grew 11.6 percent, 8.7 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively, compared to the growth of the elderly and young. The employment situation did not seem to be good for young people, said an NSO official. Unemployment among young people was 8.6 percent in October, which is 0.1 percentage point (p) from the previous year, and employment support index 3, a jobless rate for young people, increased by 0.6 percent to 21.7 percent. pdhis959@yna.co.kr Nihongai Ji-KaI said, "" North Korea refused to respond to China's demands to ease economic sanctions by North Korea, and I have allowed Song Jae-dong, the special envoy to visit Beijing, to avoid having any political positions.

China, however, did not change its stance to demand North Korea halt its nuclear development and U.S. military drills at the same time, and showed a reluctance to allow the North to ease sanctions it claimed. North Korea also pointed out that the special envoy is excessively low. China's two former special envoy after the National Congress of the Communist Party of China was a member of the Communist Party's political bureau, but Songtao stressed that he is a member of a lower committee.
