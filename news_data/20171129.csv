"【 Seoul = New System=North Korea's Lineage M public information (Source = Lineage M Home page) 【 Seoul = New Sist 】ore M HomePager : In case of mobile game, probability item of 0.0001 is raised as a probability item. The game industry insists that it is only the choice of individual users as the information is disclosed through tightened regulations on its own, but the odds are high that the game industry is making fun of users by setting a Lotto rate. According to industry sources on July 29, the K-GAMES has been enforcing a more self-regulating, stochastic item system since July. Under the revised self-regulation regulation, the service operators shall provide the users with information on the pertinent items based on facts and figures (name, grade, number of supply, period of supply, composition). However, the chances of users choosing the higher-performing items and characters they want remain at at least 0.0001 percent. According to the stochastic product instruction, developed by NCsoft as July 5, "" Lineage M, "" a multI-connection role game, picking a rare item is as difficult as winning Lotto. In particular, only 0.001 percent of the equipment is considered to have a legend written by the author, which is essential to produce rare class equipment. You need 600 diamonds, the articles in the game to pick up this paid item. Lineage M sells 120 diamonds for 3300 won. It is 15,500 won in cash. Still, the probability is too low, creating a problem. Netmarble's mobile MMORPG (to the contrary, Lineage II Revolution) had the same chance of being a Lotto. According to the probability-type item information disclosed in the official cafe on July 6, only 0.0003 to 0.003 % of the items with the highest level of SR-class items in games were found. Even for lower-grade items with an R rating, the figure was very low with 0.028 to 0.364 percent. As an SR-class item is the highest rating, it can increase the character's combat power and shorten the time needed to catch monsters in a game. Users want to equip their computers with SR-class items because they can solve difficult areas to play in one sitting. To obtain this, the Advanced Equipment Developement Box can be purchased with 120 units of the game's merchandise. Netmarble sells a total of 160 diamonds at 5,500 won per diamond, adding 10 if purchased at 93,000 won and 150 others at 150 won. Nexon's MMORPG to the draw has similar odds. The paid stochastic item information released into the game showed that 0.0018 to 0.008 % of items of the ' final ' rating. Since the last-rated items also enhance characters and help the game to play smoothly, users are purchasing items with a paid probability in order to equip them. To do this, purchase 10 boxes of advanced equipment as 600 rubies, the stuff in the game. Axe sells 500 rubies and 500 diamonds for 83,000 won as a diamond package. Dias are exchangeable for rubies. Dia sells 85 of them for 5,500 won on top of five orders from 50 to 3300 won and 80. Another possible item is Comtouss`s Summanner's War : Arena where the game's overseas sales amounted to 1 trillion won for the first time in Korean history. If you want to get a high-rated character in a game, you have to accept less than a 1 % chance. However, it is much better than NC Soft, Netmarble, and Nexon. The probability is that the five star characters, the four star characters made up 0.5 percent, the other 8.0 percent and the third star characters comprised 91.5 percent. As there are dozens of characters of five star class, the chances of choosing the characters that users want are significantly lower. The mystery recall needs to be carried out to get a 3-to-five star character can be played with 75 Crystal, the product in the game. Comptus sells 72 crystal packets for 3300 won and 120 crystal packages for 5,500 won. Due to such a low probability, some say that it is actually a gamble to pick items. The Korea Center for Gambling Problems has been conducting preventive training by designating stochastic items as "" a typical gambling element in a game. "" The Korea Center for Gambling Problems issued a "" Youth Gambling Prevention Education Course "" which said, "" Using a stochastic item and producing a lucky mix of items enabled gamers to quickly catch up with the growth of their desire for a long time. "" 【 Seoul = New System&amp;Computure's "" Somento's Game Screen "" shows the probability of picking characters. According to a 2015 survey by the Korea Consumer Agency, the average amount of money spent on mobile games was 89,900 won. Spending less than 100,000 won was highest at 74 percent, followed by spending less than 100,000 won at 58 people (19.3 percent) and spending more than 300,000 won (6.7 percent). The largest reason gamers buy items with duplicate responses was ' to purchase game-progressing items ', with 179 (59.7 %). - 167 people (55.7 %) or 63 % (or 43.0 %) who can ' buy a chance item they want ' or ' to get a more restricted package, item discount ' or ' to get a combination of items ' Under these circumstances, the problem is the probability item payment by teenagers. The game industry insists that payment in game is being made in Google Play and Apple Store by preventing teenagers from reckless payments via adult authentication. However, teenagers can pay with credit cards without their parents behind their backs and mobile games have no limit, prompting cash payment by teenagers with limited self-control. Lotto has a maximum purchase limit of 100,000 won, a race course limit of 100,000 won, and Korean exclusive casino Gangwon Land, which has a batting limit of 100,000 won per person. Some say that although the law does not apply to the stochastic items to gambling, it needs to be controlled in order to encourage gambling among teenagers. The game industry is also showing a tendency to be cautious about charging too much. Recently, Pearl Urbis unveiled Mobile MMORPG (Black Desert Mobile) : "" Everything you need from the content is within the game, "" and declares that it will not lead to an excessive charge. As users move out due to excessive fees, we are concerned about the possibility of leaving games, industry watchers say, Let's not pay by dividing the payment system by items such as stars and transcenders. odong85@newsis.com>"

April days out this month that the squid fishing declaration request. It is the first time that we have known such a bad year, "" said Jumunjin port in Gangneung, Gangwon Province, which is supposed to be busy due to the squid season on July 28. The most famous squid in Gangwon Province is the fish season from September to December. Jumunjin Port, the main land of squids, was packed with squid that were dried in the sea breeze at this time of year, creating a rare sight. However, the ports were inundated with fishing boats that had to leave with the hopes of becoming a full ship this year. The owner of a nine-seven-ton squid boat, Yoon Kook-jin (59), sighed while watching a boat guarding the harbor for four days since July 24. If I go out once, I need to get more than 400 or 600, so I can get my labor costs, but these days I can`t even look at squid, Yoon said, adding, "" The more I work, the less I have to leave. ""◇ East Sea Coast squid catch in seven years in the worst donghae squid was gone. It is the lowest catch in seven years. Some fishermen change fish species to make ends meet.More fishing boats are fishing for fishing - A squid whiteware that gave up on fishing fish due to a sharp decline in squid catch is anchored at Jumun Port in Gangneung, Gangwon Province on July 28. The squid, a specialty of Gangwon-do, is the adult fish from September to December, but a growing number of fishing boats are giving up fishing. / High-care journalist squid catch has decreased every year since 2010. Gangwon Province, squid catch is 10,000 in Gangwon Province, 2010, according to the headquarters hwandonghae 5438 t the year. However, this year's catch was only 36,53 tons (as of November 10).That is ravaged fishing grounds of squid fishermen to the 2004 North Korea and China to East Sea and the joint fishery agreements. Chinese grallets operating in North Korean waters are indiscriminately overfilling the squid that travels south on algae. North Korea increasingly is a Chinese fishing vessel operations in the East Sea waters. It is more than 10 times higher than in 2004. Gangwon Province, gimgwanghui hwandonghae, a senior hyeomnyeokkye action officer said last year, Korea Maritime Institute for the North Korean fishing waters for the research, commissioned by the year.Damage only reach up to 100 billion won is results.

''◇ Measurement ""East Sea Coast crisis, economic collapse"" According to the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives, Gangneung city with squid per box (20) in the case of life recently trading at between 80,000 and 100,000 won. It has doubled since last year's 40,000-50,000 won. Frozen squids (based on 8-8.5 kg weight) are also twice as expensive as before, to 72,000 won, and are called ‘ Gold Squad ’ after one year. However, fishermen say they are losing out on the small catch.Not only fishermen but also squid processing companies in Gangwon Province were put at risk of dying. As the volume of deep-sea squid decreased significantly, such as in Peru and Chile, processed raw materials are in short supply.According to the Cooperative Federation of squids processing in Gangwon Province, the processed squid makers in Donae are facing their biggest crisis in 32 years since their establishment. Among the 35 companies, 27 will go on vacation one after another. Five places have already closed. About 100 people lost their jobs due to the holiday. The other 30 locations are also unable to operate their factories normally. If all of them close their doors, the number of jobless will exceed 1,000. Companies in Gangneung, Gangwon Province, such as Jumunjin Agriculture and Forestry Park, are supplying 70 percent of processed squid products, leaving popular side dishes with a risk of disappearing from the table. Gangwon Province, along with the Korean Federation of Small and Medium Business, will ask the Ministry of Employment and Labor to declare the Jumunjin district as an "" employment disaster area. ""  [Gangneung : Go to Gyeongsangwon Reporter.com] - Copyrights ilbo Chosun Ilbo & Chosun.com, Transposing and Redistribution of Dogs in Tangchundae National Park Jin Eun-hee (46), who lives in Bulgwang-dong, Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul, recently had a giddy experience. It was only about 10 minutes since I left home to go to Bukhansan, that I faced a flock of dogs. Jin said, I was scared to death to see four or five big dogs in a group even in broad daylight. I still feel horrified if I brought my baby with me. Seoul City is trying to come up with measures against the growing number of wild abandoned dogs. Seoul City estimates that a massive redevelopment project took place in Eunpyeong-gu, where residents dumped dogs, and some of them went up to nearby Bukhansan Mountain to form a group. Unlike wild boars, wild dogs can live in groups and can attack people first without being threatened. Regarding this issue, many argue that we should allow the use of firearms to reduce the number of people immediately, and that it is not a fundamental measure. The key question is whether to recognize wild dogs as "" wild animals "" under the Wildlife Conservation Act. The current law states that "" wild animals can be designated as ‘ wild animals ’ when abandoned or escaped pets may cause ecological disturbances such as infection or loss of biodiversity. Once wild animals such as wild cats and dogs are designated, guns can be used in hunting. "" An actual view of habitat density, the status of objects and their distribution patterns is possible only after they are designated as wild animals, "" a city official said. The hunting frame at Gwanaksan Mountain has a sign that reads : ' Devices to catch wild and abandoned dogs that threaten people. ' Seoul Metropolitan Government saw wild cats and dogs from the Ministry of Environment and the Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry in January as the ' Benches on Wildlife Conservation and Management Act ' that calls for wild animals to be raised as the wild animal.That is why abandoned dogs are protected by the animal protection law even though they have adapted to the wild. Anyone who kills or abuses can face up to one year in jail or a 10 million won fine. When they are reported to the local governments and go on a hunt, they should capture the vessel by using an anesthesia gun or a capturing machine. Do not use any tool to injure a dog, such as a trap or trap. Lee Un-ho, head of the Seoul Zoo Management Team, said, It is hard to reduce the wild dogs ` numbers with traditional traps, either because they are guarded by wild dogs or because they have experience capturing machines on their own. Anesthesia guns are also less effective because they are difficult to aim at at at at at at at at several animals at the same time and take 30 minutes to go to sleep. Large abandoned dogs, which were accepted by the Korea Animal Rescue Services Association in Yangju, Gyeonggi Province, have a different view from journalist Kim Kyung-rok's animal protection group. Since catching or shooting is a way to deal with the problems already experienced, it is necessary to reduce the likelihood of abandonment and wild dogs being killed in the first place. Kim Hye-ran, director of KARA, said, "" Getting rid of all dogs that breed at once was difficult with any kind of capture, and it is most difficult to avoid the organic effect of animal registration. "" In Nokbeon-dong, Eunpyeong-gu, residents also carried out a campaign for the "" re-hardening "" of wild dogs. However, some argue that it would be easier to adopt a abandoned dog that has become a wild dog since the adoption rate of dogs is low. The Seoul Metropolitan Government has been capturing wild dogs through autonomous districts since 2011. Annual capture samples are increasing from two in 2011 to 115 last year and 102 this year. In the past three years, the number of rescue teams involving abandoned dogs in the Seoul metropolitan area increased sharply from 1,193 in 2014 to 4539 in January and October 2017. This year alone, the average number of cases per day is 15.2. Among them, 83 accidents were also reported. The most dangerous example is the use of wild abandoned dogs as a group to threaten people. In reality, out of 12,377 cases, two or more of them showed up en masse, accounting for 9.8 % (128,000 times). There were 151 cases of more than five people who showed up and threatened people. The number of apartments (77), apartments (21), and roads (21) was the order of their occurrence. Most apartments were located near the mountain, including Bukhansan.

The video was from a car black box. In the video clip, the faces of children who fell down from their bikes in an apartment complex were hit by a car. The quality of the pictures was clear enough for both parents and acquaintances to know who the children were. It was also surprising when their faces were revealed : The account posted a video, telling the children, "" Tell them how to drive through a corner. The blackback car is damaged by a new car, the official said. Images posted on Instagram account by Used Car Shopping Mall, VaI BaI Dream. It was mosaic that showed the exact same exposure. When I checked my account to see who was posting the video on social networking sites, it was a second-hand car shopping mall. Account introductions said, This is the first car shopping mall in the nation, along with NoorI-kook addresses. Seo shook his head, saying, I don`t know why they are pumping up the used car shopping mall when the video of the black box uploaded by individuals on YouTube and others is a problem. Seo was anxious to see my face on the black box in this way. Images recently posted on YouTube Account by Used Car Shopping Center. Black Box / Black House Dream, which was posted as the nation's largest auto member, posted on YouTube and Instagram If you listen to an explanation by an official with the Baehang Dream, the bulletin contains an average of 200 black box videos per day. It is one of the most active black box related communities in the nation. The video chosen by the Dream Team is then uploaded back via the Esn&S channel, which posted a total of 90 black box images on YouTube from November 1 to 28. The average daily figure is 3.4. The same video is uploaded to YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram at the same time, so the total number of uploads can be doubled. The problem is that some of the video clips posted on the network are likely to cause personal information breaches and defamation. They include "" No Message "" video without covering up personal information such as face, voice, and vehicle number, "" Just for Interest "" video, and what is called the "" Mrs Kim "" video that unilaterally criticizes female drivers.■ The most disturbing example is the movie, "" No Message, "" in which personal information is exposed. The official channel of Dream S & S, which is located at the end of the month, has video without covering the face as well as the license plate number. The clips unlocked and debunked the container doors, cargo trucks that were opened, and vehicles that threw garbage on the streets. In some cases, the letters were hidden, saying, "" We have covered the numbers.

A vehicle number can not be identified as an individual immediately like a face, but can be viewed as a person's personal information when combined with other information. According to a recent court ruling, the idea of a mobile phone (USIM) and the first four digits of a phone number were also recognized as personal information. Pictures posted on Instagram account by the used car shopping mall ' Baejang Dream, ' which was mosaic. The images of the black box, which show the back of a pedestrian, were also posted, although the face was not exposed. It was a picture of a woman behind the cart. The "" Back-Up Dream "" posted this photo on Instagram, saying, "" Employees work hard to retrieve and lose. "" And "" It was damaged by the uneven cart riding that damaged the exterior roads. "" Even though the posting was about a safety accident that might have violated the cart's rules, the comments were met with derogatory comments about the woman's appearance in the picture, contrary to what she meant. "" You can study driving, "" said an official with the band's Dream Team on the phone at < Hankyoreh > on the reason why you operate an S&S channel, in which case such pictures are relevant to driving. ■ Unsubstantiated video of misogyny, or a black box with what is called "" Mrs. Kim, "" who unilaterally condemn female drivers of the market, is also a favorite subject. As part of her dream, one of the members asked a message on the bulletin board, "" What's wrong with you, Mrs. Kim?Why aren't you going to Aunt Faran's? They changed the title to ' Cause Back Impact? ' and posted it on YouTube and others. There were also occasions when she added unnecessary comments, such as "" The driver was in a terrible trouble with your husband. "" But none of the drivers were identified as women. Video posted on Instagram account by Used Car Shopping Mall. Because of this reason why is it that the Baehang Dream&S Channel also asked, "" Why is it that you see that video? "" Black confirmed that the car was a woman, and commented on the criticism, "" What is the driver's criteria, not Kim's, and Mrs. First of all, members are responsible for posting black box images conclusively, but the anti-replication dream of reproduction without verification can not escape criticism either. Jeong Soo-ra, director of the Korean People's Diversion Media Movement Headquarters, said, As too many disgust expressions are freely distributed throughout Korean society, operators such as the anti-foreign dream were right when they were criticized for their disgust and scorn. Some people even doubt whether it is for commercial purposes. There is an effect to bring in new homes via Esance, said an official with the Baean`s Dream Team, < Hankyoreh >. Considering the fact that the "" Back-Up Dream "" is a second-hand car shopping mall, it is hard to even present a "" public-service purpose "" for video distribution of the black box. In response to this comment, the Government's Dream Team emphasizes "" learning effects "" from the black box video. We run many voice box videos for the non-members and non-home-discipliners to access the video, said an official with the B&S Dream. The anti- bae dream was revealed to the members, while the anti- bae dream said, "" Any postings that violate other people's rights or harm others ' reputation through notices are subject to sanctions by related laws. If the party in the video raises a question, we will delete it immediately. Considering the nature of the black box images, the statement is intended to be based on the fact that the image is distributed without the consent of the parties concerned and the film producers do not match with each other.■ Law-minded legal experts point out that reckless distribution of black box images by the "" Black Box Image Distribution and defamation "" can cause defamation issues. A Ph.D.-level researcher from the legal profession called "" No Member who posted the first black box video in a civil or criminal defamation suit over the spread of personal information, "" and placed it on the S&S Channel. He explained that since he acted aggressively as an NSS user, such as screening out movies, his dream could become a party to defamation. It is pointed out that the blind spot in the law should be corrected quickly, such as a black box for cars. Car black boxes have rapidly increased in recent years to 64.3 million as of December 2014 (Ministry of Public Administration and Security announced). Considering the total number of car registrations for the same year was around 2011, the black box installation rate could be estimated at 30 percent. The Korea International Trade Institute estimates that the annual sales of black boxes are estimated to be between two and 2.5 million units. However, currently, in Article 25 of the Personal Information Protection Act, video processing equipment limiting installation and operation is equipped with fixed devices such as CCTV. Mobile video processing equipment, such as black boxes for vehicles, has no regulations on the treatment of medicines in the current regulatory framework. Although the Ministry of Public Administration and Security announced a revised law last year to remove blind spots in regulations, civic groups, including the Progressive Network Center, Opennet, and People`s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, and the Personal Information Protection Commission, said yesterday that they had adopted a revision to the law. Civic groups criticized in their statement, The Ministry of Public Administration and Security's proposal has no limit on the purpose of taking personal video information via mobile video cameras and a wide range of mandatory pre-consensus rules. People are increasingly concerned about the fact that the public are undiscriminately photographed by black boxes to control public service laws by the People`s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, a political group said on the issue of the CCTV system and the fact that the police are investigating each case based on its own involvement. We are putting the cart before the horse. Some also point out that without rules and protection for the black box images, the problem could become worse. If you don`t respond carefully to the black box video, what will you do about it later? In fact, the side effects of drones could be worse than black boxes, he argued. It is time to make a decision whether or not to continue in an uncontrolled state, he said.

"Rescue from Minorities ... North Korean Victims Are Powerless Patients "" Lee Guk-jong, head of the Center for Expassments and Exparturers of South Korea's Taeguk-do Hospital held a briefing room Monday morning at South Korea's National University Hospital in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province. (Photo : Lee Han-hyung) As the body of the North Korean soldier who defected from the Joint Security Area after being shot several times, interest in the serious trauma center is rising.However, field doctors are moaning in the face of the reality that the trauma care system is still out of place and manpower and facilities can not be properly placed.◇ Measurement 'Gangjeong, hands,' of the operating room, no trauma center and a doctor, "" The focus is only for this patient in fact, you can, but I went last night to bring the patient, my.The patient is likely to lose your life to medical personnel are battling high. We have about 150 such patients now. "" We have very few doctors in our hospital. We don't have a major. Surgery is an unpopular sport. The center is not sustainable in Korea, said Professor Lee Kook-jong of the Achillan`s Regional trauma center, who rescued the soldier who was shot to death, in a news briefing on July 22.Severe trauma center is a place equipped with the personnel and equipment to treat emergency patients with fatal injuries such as a traffic accident, a fall, or a bullet wound through emergency surgery. In Korea, captain Seok Hae-kyun, who was seriously injured during the Operation Dawn of the Gulf of Aden, was treated at the center and the government has spent 200 billion won since 2012 to assist regional installations.However, only nine out of 17 regional trauma centers nationwide are currently operating, and when patients arrive, there are considerable cases of unpreparedness. There is not a single center among the nine centers that has been filled with 20 doctors who are required to work as specialists.That is because the heavy trauma field is considered to be the ' target of avoidance ' by doctors. Due to the nature of the trauma center, the system has to be maintained at 365 days and 24 hours a day, but with only a few employees being involved, the center is often under severe pressure. Still, the bonuses are not high, it is not easy to open a private hospital in the future, and some have turned into "" a journey "" to hire a professor. As such, the vicious circle of challenge and hard work is repeating.In addition, since trauma centers do not have high patient turnover or affordability, they not only utilize their specialists ' beds and operating room, but also other areas. Of course, it is all illegal.For severely disabled patients with fractured skull, fractured pelvis and bleeding brain, it is no use keeping emergency rooms large, professor Lee told CBS Nocut last year. We need professional trauma doctors to go and see it quickly, said one step away from the spotlight, unless they follow international standards guidelines.◇ Transfer denial, refusal, refusal, …, death (photo = time to change the world, 15 minutes of video capture / data photo) … In reality, Kim Min-gun, who was transferred to Jeonju during the last September 30, was operated on by a car accident (when he was operated on by a car accident) After being hit by a reversing tractor, fractured his pelvis, and damaged his organs, he was immediately taken to the Jeonbuk University Hospital Emergency Medical Center. However, the hospital decided to send an orthopedist to another hospital in 22 minutes without calling him.Thirteen hospitals, including Chonnam National University Hospital, which was a regional trauma center, and the National Medical Center, denied patients because they did not have doctors. Eventually, when he arrived at Aju University Hospital in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, his heart had already stopped.Doctors at Aju University Hospital, who lacked an emergency helicopter, were forced to step up their efforts to provide aid to Gyeonggi Fire & Marine Insurance Agency and the National 119 Rescue Service.The first motorcycle accident patients to be sent to hospital in Ajudae two hours ago were transferred from Icheon, started emergency surgery, and were already injured when the hospital was injured in close proximity.The Ministry of Health and Welfare announced measures to prevent the local trauma center from easily supplying patients to other hospitals except in exceptional cases. In addition, they cancelled the appointments of centers for the controversial hospitals for a while, and then rearranged the hospitals after the situation subsided. (CBS Nocut News 16.10. 20 cancellation of the designation of emergency medical centers at Jeonbuk National University Hospital is believed to be a matter of reporting to Cheong Wa Dae, which the office has requested, but recently changed the "" Envelope of the Heart "" video. The ministry has belatedly decided to take action, but distrust remains in and out of the country."" We heard that we were going to provide five more Doctor helicopters, but if we don't improve the overall helicopter transport system, it will end with no improvement whatsoever. """" I think it's the powerless patients who get to the ministry's approach, simply by resolving civil petitions, and see the victims ' involvement in money drives them crazy, "" the ministry said, sighing out resources.Another trauma center specialist said, I have been keeping my eyes closed when a few doctors were working on the details of the law, and the ministry has been trying to stop it because it is too hard. That means that the previous "" breaking-in order "" did not solve the problem at the scene.This has led to speculation that 17 other cities across the nation have not given up on sharing their land while initially pushing for the establishment of centers on a limited budget. This is a task the government should solve when it prepares to announce countermeasures."
"Estimating North Korea of icbm illustration foreign expert policy analysis and synthesis ... picture a long-range ballistic missile (pg) [Lee Tae-ho, choejayun] wp, "" used a fake warhead would increase its range.""the spotlight on a series of late-night launch"" the capital to respond to the United States nuclear deterrent of 北 it due to its proximity ""U.S. Department of Defense"" "" (Washington, dropping East after the missiles estimated 1,000 kilometers of flight icbm 北.Epa : Yonhap News Agency) medium long-range strategic ballistic missile launched from an undisclosed place and North Korea last August. On August 28, the United States Department of Defense (local time) North Korea is on 1 p.m., 17 minutes and an intercontinental ballistic missile (62nd minute at 3 a.m. on November 29, Korean time) (icbm) that launched one missile suspected.""Sain-ri The North Korean missile was launched in the 1km from 1,000 to fly around East Japan after the fall within the exclusive economic zone (eez)."" said that he detected. Lee Seung-woo, correspondent of the Yonhap news agency ro Many experts say the missile could have improved its second stage of propulsion. In an article posted on the UCS site, physicist David Wright of the U.S. non-profit Scientists ' Society for Participatory Scientists (UCS) stated that the missile reach is higher than 4,500 kilometers and that its flight distance is closer to 1,000 kilometers. Wright argued that if the missile had flown at a normal altitude to maximize its reach, it would have reached more than 13,000 kilometers. `` It is significantly longer in range than the previous long-range missile tests, which flew 37-47 minutes each, '' he said. `` Such a missile would have more than reached Washington D.C. The distance from Pyongyang to Washington D.C. is about 11,000 kilometers. However, the weight of the warheads is not known, so it is highly possible that fake warheads were placed, which were far below the weight of nuclear warheads. The Washington Post, which posted Wright's argument on its front page, said, "" Scientists don't know the payload of the missile, "" adding, "" It looked like a fake warhead that was very light considering the increase in distance. "" `` If that's true, that would mean the missile can not carry a nuclear warhead far, '' Wright said. "" If the figures for this test launch are correct, North Korea has shown the United States that a substantial portion of the Washington D.C. area and the East Coast area is at a crossroads, "" said Syer Cotton, a researcher at the James Martin Diffusion Research Center. But he added North Korea has yet to secure reentry techniques. Cotton had previously guessed that North Korea was developing a better two-stage propulsion system. If the flight time was right, we saw an improvement in the payload capacity, and said that it was the second stage.[Graphic] In North Korea, Washington D.C. on a normal launch flight or an Intersection-Range Intersection-Terrestrial (Seoul = Yonhap news Agency), foreign media reported recently that North Korea launched two large-range ballistic missiles, called ' Mars Repower ' during a launch by North Korea. Type 1994-14 is considered an ICP-class missile with a liquid single-stage intermediate range missile (IRC), upgraded to a two-stage propulsion system. Jeffrey Lewis MidloverI, a well-known missile specialist in the United States, also wrote on Twitter, ' I think the missile's test flight time is 50 minutes, ' suggesting another ICP-14. Vipinnarang, an associate professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said on Twitter that "" North Korea did not want us to know they could hit Washington D.C. and the East Coast, "" which means North Korea was more powerful than South Korea. He explained, "" The night missile launches increase preparation, the possibility of survival, and the ability of infiltration. "" But it does not change the strategic picture that we faced last July, he added. International security expert Abraham Denmark also evaluated, "" The night launch shows North Korea is closer than ever to securing a credible nuclear deterrent against the United States. "" German missile expert Dr. Marcus Schiller says North Korea is still in the experimental stage, "" They may be able to hit Washington D.C., but they can not fight with it. "" Some also interpreted that North Korea restrained provocation for 75 days before the test fire was not for strategic reasons but for seasonal reasons. Citing an analysis by cotton researchers, WP reports that North Korea's missile tests have increased sharply since its leader Kim Jong-un took office in 2011, but have shown a tendency to concentrate only during the first nine months of every year. North Korea reportedly conducted only six of the 76 missile tests since 2012. This is due to seasonal changes in the number of soldiers used to harvest in the fall harvest, WP explained. leslie@yna.co.kr"

The tension on the Korean Peninsula has soared to a record high as North Korea launched another provocation again in the 75th day since Sept. 15. The sense of crisis grew especially high when the North Korean nuclear missile, Type 1950-15, was an ICT-like that could hit the entire U.S. mainland with nuclear warheads. The missile improved significantly compared to the provocations in the middle of September. Moon Jae-in is condemning North Korea's attempt to attack the president of the situation on the Korean peninsula, along with reliable officials to focus on.

It was the first time that North Korea fired a missile in five hours, making a call between the two heads of state on the day of North Korea's provocations. It is because the situation was so tense. At 5:15 p.m., I spoke to Prime Minister Abe for 20 minutes and stressed China`s role in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, saying it can not tolerate any more North Korea`s threats. In this regard, “During a visit to Beijing next month asking him to her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to more powerful role through the plan” is the president told Abe.“China is more role in pressuring North Korea is very important.”, he responded.

The statement reaffirmed the stance that the Korean Peninsula should not go to war. However, this provocation of North Korea's president's plan to the door and solutions, it's more messed up. As North Korea's provocations, which had been dormant for some time, became a reality, tension between the U.S. and North Korea has become aroused, and the possibility of the Berlin Initiative becoming a reality has virtually ended. In this regard, “North Korea's provocative military adventurism, stop unless peace is not possible on the Korean Peninsula.” is the president, and it's "" overwhelming power based on the edge.Immediately protect the Republic of Korea, in the event of armed provocation from North Korea's nuclear missile threat more punitive to be able to remove a threat to redouble its will.Said.

Experts point out that the first priority is improving the corporate culture. When companies plan to make their annual performance, it is one way for them to make plans to recharge their employees, said Yoo Kyu-chang, a business professor at Hanyang University. A recent survey of 767 office workers conducted by a job portal site showed that 596 (77.7 percent) of them still have their annual income this year. The main reasons are ' supervisor's attention (39.4 percent), ' business administration department ' (37.9 percent), and ' company atmosphere (27.5 percent), which is not good enough to write yearly, ' and ' company atmosphere (27.5 percent) ' (5 percent).Kim Hyung-jun, a reporter at Getty Image Bank mediaboy@hankookilbo.com[Korean daily newspaper (hankookilbo.com), No illegally reprinted and distributed] Chairman Choi Jong-koo (Yonhap news agency), who will announce plans to support the long-term micro-defenders, will announce the results of the announcement on Monday morning by the Financial Services Commission Chairman Choi Jong-koo (second from right). From left, Choi Seong-il, Vice Chairman of Financial Supervisory Service, Kim Yoon-young, Chairman of the Korea Asset Management Corporation, Moon Chang-yong, president of the Korea Asset Management Corporation. If the small amount (principal less than 10 million won) could not be repaid over 10 years, it was based on the perception that the debt was not actually "" not to be paid, "" but rather "" not to be repaid. "" Moon Jae-in the president's campaign promises as well. A total of 1.59 million people were identified as long-term and minor delinquents. These can be classified into four main types depending on their situation and how they are disbursed. Park Geun-hye for national happiness made during a bond has taken 83 million in arrears, funds and funds not go on to the 76 million people happiness. Each case is divided into those who are paying off their debts with a debt adjustment agreement and those who are still in arrears with their commitments. The committee decided to question their ability to repay what they have to do with their individual reviews and the en masse reviews. It is to see if you have the money to repay the debt and how much you earn. The member shall be exempted from the obligation based on the audit results or receive up to a 90 % reduction in the debt. First of all, a full-scale review is not required to be requested in person. It is made for those who are in arrears with the U.S. contract. It is to see if they have more property than they could afford, except for "" welfare assets, "" such as non-posturing seizure for a minimum of 10 years, disabled vehicles, and commercial vehicles with less than one ton of money. If the income is less than 60 % of the median income without any recoverable assets, the collection is stopped immediately after the conclusion that it can not be repaid. Sixty percent of the median income is 990,000 won per month for a lone person. It is the "" living cost of maintaining a decent life "" that the courts apply to individual regeneration. Even when they are paying back their debt with a debt adjustment agreement, it can be too much for them to pay back the debt. In this case, if you apply to the National Happiness Fund or the Credit Recovery Committee, you will be screened again. If the individual judges do not find the ability to repay the debt, they can forgive the debt. The problem is the ' moral hazard '. This is a tag that has always been followed by the debt write-off that has been carried out by previous governments. It is because it is a kind of economic amnesty."" In many ways, the committee has minimized the scope of moral hazard to intervene in the program, "" explained the Financial Supervisory Service. That is because they are already conscious of the fact that they only support long overdue bills. It also stressed that with the cooperation of the National Tax Service or the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, the company will determine the ability to repay assets based on the status of assets, credit card use, and housing lease agreements. In particular, the evaluation process includes a three-year grace period until the exemption of debt (incineration of bonds). If the assets or incomes hidden during that time are revealed, take them out before the "" bond incinerator "" catches fire. The exemption will be registered as an insider of financial order under the Credit Information Act and will limit financial transactions for up to 12 years. The Center for Report to the Interruptee is operated, and the accuser is rewarded. However, it is expected that the debate over the fairness of the "" sincere "" exchange (weak) and "" delinquent payment "" among those who have fulfilled their debt, and those who have failed to do so is likely to end. It is also a burden to see that the expectation that the government will resolve the debts by holding on to it is not far off. The financial resources of purchasing overdue bonds are also expected to be disputed. The Financial Services Commission decided to form a non-profit foundation to purchase 762,000 long-and-minute bonds (127,000 public institutions and 635,000 private financial institutions) that the National Happiness fund did not buy. The new foundations are judged by purchasing overdue debts of loan companies or collecting companies by creating funds with donations from civic and social groups or contributions from financial institutions. It does not cost as much as the National Happiness fund, but it can not avoid the point of beating ' the arm ' of private financial institutions. In response, Financial Policy Minister Lee Myung-soon of the Small and Medium Business Committee said, It is not the creditors ` fault that the bonds were insolvent and that they were delayed in payment due. zheng@yna.co.kr"
"As new technologies of the fourth industrial revolution emerge, there is growing fear of the loss of jobs in humans. Experts say about 5 million jobs are expected to disappear by 2020. The jobs war is already a "" future "" for humans.Amazon Go, an intelligent and unmanned store opened in Seattle last year, has caused quite a stir in the retail and IT industries. Ad video from Amazon High has the phrase ' Just walk out ', which means you don't have to wait in line to pay. The evolution of Amazon technology usually means convenience, but for some it is fear. The start was a high pass. Park Soon-hyang (43), who works as a tollgate teller at Seosan, has seen numerous colleagues who lost their jobs due to high pass during the past few years. In the near future, his ' workplace ' itself disappears. Beginning next year, the government will introduce a system that automatically recognizes license plates of running vehicles as wireless communication antennas and video identification technologies and pays for them, and apply it to all highways nationwide by 2020. The entire toll collection process is unmanned and the toll gate itself disappears. There are about 7,000 tollgate collectors left in the country who will lose their jobs when it is built. The recipients, who are irregular workers from outsourcing companies, are demanding the Korea Highway Corporation switch to full-time jobs. The court also admitted the illegally sending the workers to the highway in a two trial case, but the acting president of the highway corporation, Shin Jae-sang, recently quoted as saying in a parliamentary audit trail gate that there would be no direct appointment of employees. The logic is that by 2020, the "" tollgate teller "" jobs will have disappeared. From the beginning, the recipients were not temporary workers affiliated with a subcontractor. Park Soon-hyang said, "" Once a receiver was hired directly by the highway corporation, the high pass rate was increased and the monthly contract for hiring three people out of a large tollgate began to be phased out at the end of 2009. The anxiety of employees over the introduction of the Smattoling program is growing. That is not to say that the janitors should not remove the tollgate itself. Even though the storage tasks disappear, the job transfers should stop 7,000 people losing their jobs at once. Park said, "" Highpass is said to have replaced many of the human services of reception, but with an increase in overdue transportation fees, employees had to put their lives on dangerous roads and their convenience at work. "" ■ Unmanned, ' jobs war ' outpost The initiatives to make highway tollgalls completely unmanned were announced with TransRoad, the future direction the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's policy direction. It is to create a new road that transcended the existing road by autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI). It is widely debated recently as being linked to the fourth industrial revolution. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced plans to build a completely autonomous driving infrastructure by 2035 and to realize artificial intelligence roads using AI. In short, big data will help control traffic jams and pave the way for autonomous vehicles, a feature of which is the lack of evidence of jobs in the flood of ' future roads '. Now, the job of a fare collector is threatened, but the job losses in the future could increase as much as possible over road traffic."" World War III will be a ' jobs war, ' "" predicted Jim Clifton, CEO of Gallup, a global polling company, two years ago. The prediction is recollecting with the heated discussion on the fourth industrial revolution and the nation`s most high-profile industrial revolution since job issues were mentioned at the World Economic Forum in Davos last January. At the Davos Forum, experts predicted that the fourth industrial revolution would kill about 5 million jobs by 2020. Some say that the fourth industrial revolution is not distinct from the third industrial revolution, and because of it, the notion that "" the fourth industrial revolution that is hitting Korean society at the moment "" would be just a vague fad word. ▽ Presidential election of ` 9 Group of Korean Industries, ` and ` 4th Industrial Revolution ` which was promised last year, ` the future ` will be rapidly developed as artificial intelligence, big data, Internet of things, and virtual reality (VR) technology. Even if the concept is still ' unclear ', it is also true that some kind of change, called the fourth industrial revolution, is already rapidly changing the labor market. One example is the "" unmanned wind "". The unmanned convenience store operated by the E-Mart 24. E-Mart 24 runs its four directly operated stores as an unmanned convenience store throughout the country. / E-Mart 24. "" It is better to buy a $ 35,000 robot arm last May than an hourly $ 15 salary for an inefficient worker packing French fries. "" Last May, the world's biggest fast food company, McDonald's, raised its price. It was said that United States union allies were protesting against the $ 15 minimum hourly wage campaign, saying, "" There would be incredible unemployment. "" While ' Robot Arm ' has not yet appeared at McDonald's, the number of drive-assisted drive-and-payments (kiosks) that replace a certain amount of human activity is growing. McDonald's announced last June that it would introduce kiosks within this year at more than 2,500 U.S. stores. Despite growing public opinion that the unmanned gate will take jobs, McDonald's shares soared. The front line of unmanned winds is distribution. Late last year, Amazon launched Amazon Go, an intelligent and unmanned store in Seattle, U.S. The signature commercial message for the store is ' Just walk out. ' Amazons have no clerks or calculators. Therefore, you do not have to line up for payment or open your purse. When consumers scan the QR codes registered on their smartphones, they enter the store and select items, using artificial deep-dip algorithms and sensor technologies, to make payment automatically. Amazon has tested the technological prowess of its Amazon city and applied it to the actual store, and is preparing to apply the system sequentially to the Whole Foods Store it acquired in May of this year.In comparison, the level of the movement toward the uninhabited region is low, but even in the nation's Jewish communities. South Korean McDonald's has installed unmanned gate machines in 200 of its 430 stores nationwide, and plans to expand to 250 stores next year, more than half of its stores. Lotteria has also installed and operated unmanned wine machines at 61 stores, which account for 45 percent of its 1350 stores nationwide. There are also many unmanned stores that are still test-run but have no employees. Last May, the 7-Eleven opened an unmanned convenience store at Jamsil Lotte World Tower, followed by the E-Mart 24 with Jeonju switch point, Seoul Joseon Hotel, Seongsu Baekpark store and Jangan Metro store. The owner of the store writes the credit card in front of the entrance to the terminal and makes a self-payment at the unmanned checkout counter. The distribution industry expects that when the technologies are commercialized, they will replace the late night labor, which costs more to hire. ■ The advent of ‘ on-demand economy ’ and ‘ smearing labor ’ section experts say ICT - a characteristic of the fourth industrial revolution - is the convergence of traditional technologies and existing technologies that evolved together into the areas of ICT. For example, it is Google, not the car manufacturer, who has used autonomous car technologies to take over the transportation market, and Amazon is also the most active in creating a delivery system using drones. The boundaries between businesses and businesses are not just disappearing. The boundaries of work are collapsing rapidly, too. Supplier becomes a demand and vice versa Roh Yong-kwan, senior researcher at KDB`s Industrial Technology Research Center, said in a May report that the traditional boundaries between companies and their producers have been weakened and their prediction of job changes. A typical example is the rise of on-demand, on-demand services built on smart devices. Air Vi&B, which shares and connects empty rooms and empty homes, and Wuber, who shares empty seats in cars are already well-known. The way that trading parties deal with goods and services via digital platforms is gradually expanding to include delivering or housekeeping labor, legal and consulting counseling, and taking care of small clients on errands. In a way, this is the future that came earlier than the fourth industrial revolution. Park Eun-young (36), a working mother, uses her application to get help with household chores and gives them back home two times a month. When the child was younger than now, he or she found a resident helper to take care of her children, but when the baby is older, she often finds a part-time job when she is busy. You can leave your home to clean or wash for 4 hours at the rate of 40,000 to 50,000 won. Then, it is best to find someone when you need them. "" When I used my assistant, I needed a fill-in job, "" Kim said, "" and I needed a one-time stress of resolving opinions when I was in conflict or didn't like it, and of saving and cutting people. "" The Mobile Reservation Service (Uber) is at the center of a controversy called a ' shareless shared economy. ' / Uber's idea of creating a model economy"
"Injuries have become popular as a new ' shared economy ' brought on by improvements in digital platforms in the connection of excess time and goods, while at the same time expanding ' geeky economy, ' a traditional concept of employment, and also spreading out into jobs. Geek Economy is a term derived from "" geek, "" in which a performer was instantly cast around an American jazz venue in the 1920s, and refers to part-time or freelance work when necessary. The arrival of such a job received rave reviews on one hand and concerns on the other. McKenzie has estimated that the added value of geeky economy will reach 2.7 trillion dollars, or about 2 percent of global GDP, by 2025, and has cut back the estimated cost of unemployment by 540 million worldwide. Some here also predicted that the flexibility of working hours would give women, stay-at-home moms and retreats the opportunity to re-enter the labor market. ■ A shared economy with shared concepts, but jobs that are left to run on a daily basis as needed, are also pointed to as "" extremely unstable and unstable. "" While convenience and efficiency have increased for consumers who need home help with a few mobile clicks, the reverse is that for service providers, the rapid replacement of full-time home help jobs is a significant threat to their employees. Critics say the "" shared economy "" can no longer be an alternative platform. Lee Kwang-seok, a professor of technology at Seoul National University of Science and Technology, wrote in his article, ' The Fourth Industrial Revolution and Civic Technolo Intellectual Prospects ' (lying > North Korea's Industrial Revolution), "" We share the concept of an online platform as being effective. "" "" It is the reality of sharing today that only patterns are divided into goods and labor, and there is little democratic distribution or reward or social donation of what is shared. "" As an example, Woober, who started with the idea of ‘ making every driver a knight, ’ would make a taxi out of an empty car. There is also the problem of these jobs, which drop workers into "" jobless workers, "" driving them to blind spots where labor laws are not available. Since the advent of the "" delivery app, "" the delivery workers have not been employed by restaurants or businesses but rather by individual businesses. As the private business is not able to obtain individual contracts with delivery agencies, the minimum wage protection system is The dispute is underway abroad. The London Employment Tribunal for Britain's London recently ruled in favor of Uber drivers, saying, "" A driver is an employee who needs to be legally protected, not a self-employed employee. "" Last year, the first trial judged that it was unfair to classify Uber drivers as self-employed and not guarantee the basic rights of workers such as minimum wage, but the court judged that Wuber did not support the decision. Professor Lee Kwang-seok said, "" These platforms are the platforms that break down into minutes to find and provide resources and labor, implement an "" extreme labor time management economy, "" and become a "" human market monopoly "" platform. Another problem is that these jobs cause a kind of "" illusion "" in various employment indicators. It is important to note that the analysis that the rise in wages is not rising despite a significant improvement in unemployment in the United States is due to an increase in low-paid temporary employment, including geeky economics, Roh said. US unemployment fell from 10 % in 2009 to 4.9 % in 2016 ; however, the rate of increase in wages is flat - 2.2 % to 2.5 % during the same period. IMF also released its latest Advanced Wage Dynamics report last September : "" Unemployment rates were dropping to pre-economic levels, but the wages were rising slowly. "" The ratio of ' involuntary part-time workers ' who work less than 30 hours a week has risen steadily since the global financial crisis, so the unemployment rate in developed countries has risen at a record low level in the past decade, including the increase in wages. Where an involuntary part-time worker is considered to be a employed person and is left out of the estimates of unemployment. In Korea, people who work more than one hour per week are considered employed. As unemployment figures are seen as a "" trap, "" it is difficult to reflect the exact status of employment as more involuntary part-time jobs are created. If the wage increase fails to meet the productivity increase, the current low price situation will continue, warned us not to ignore the situation of wage increases.< Seonmyeongsu journalist sms@kyunghyang.com> ② Weekly trends (weekly.khan.co.kr), Unauthorized reproduction and redistribution prohibited (Proprietary Newspaper) is a copyright exercise using the digital news rules of the Korea Online Newspaper Association (www.kona.or.kr)< 220 million won in damages from Incheon District Court's ruling : We did not check the time of intake of powdered milk before the injection. It was believed that she died from suffocation from airway closing. A family of a 34-year-old woman who died while being injected with a IV vein at a University Hospital in Incheon was found to have won a few cases in a civil lawsuit against a hospital management firm. The Incheon District Court's civil affairs division announced on July 29 that the bereaved family of A (1) decided in part to pay 220 million won in damages suit against a B University Hospital operator. She started to heat up to 38 degrees Celsius on June 22 last year. As the fever failed, her mother went to the gynecologist who gave birth to Miss A on the morning of the next day, and then went to hospital B when she heard, "" Go to the big hospital. "" Her parents, along with a doctor's diagnosis that the cause of the fever was a central nervous system infection, were recommended to have a spinal puncture. Spinal puncture is a test of an infection by removing the spinal cord from the brain. Ringer.But newborns are usually in dangerous situations, such as breathing difficulty and closing prayers, because they can't move their heads or legs to one side and then pull them out from behind. Miss A's parents also did not accept spinal puncture and wanted medicine for fever and antibiotics. Since the symptoms of fever have been eliminated and the amount of oil consumed has increased, he decided to leave the hospital on July 27. When he was to leave the hospital, an intravenous injection was a problem. She received an injection of a IV vein from a nurse at around 2:35 p.m. on July 27. However, three minutes later, at 2:38 p.m., her crying became quiet and she began to show symptoms of cyanosis. The nurse immediately gave first aid, such as a chest percussion (with the head turned down and tapping on the back), but she died around 4:11 p.m. An autopsy report showed that no diseases could cause cardiac arrest and that the records of the release of powdered milk from the prayer show that it was believed that she died of suffocation during airway. The parents of the two women said, The nurse injected the IV and died immediately after the accident, claiming a medical accident. On the other hand, the hospital said it conducted an intravenous injection to comply with the medical standards of 1 hour after meals. Newborn.

"" We can not find a clear basis for the principle of eliminating intravenous injections (medically) after an hour as prescribed by the hospital. "" It appears that the medical team did not perform any intubation or chest compressions immediately when the oxygen saturation was not measured, "" the judge said.

It is only two weeks since Songtao, who sent his delegation to North Korea on July 17 to explain the results of the summit talks with China's Communist Party's ruling Workers ' Party, will return to Seoul to discuss the North's nuclear standoff with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. China, which has been mired in another round of dialogue solutions due to North Korea's provocations, is also set to return to the negotiating table with the U.S. while negotiating both sides at the same time. Analysts say that a sharp cooling of the relationship between North and China is also inevitable. China's Foreign Ministry re-declared its intention Thursday to oppose and fear of North Korea's missile attacks. China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Gengshuang said, I hope North Korea will stop acting with caution and keep peace and stability with the local community.Beijing's diplomatic community said China, which is concerned about weakening its influence on the Korean Peninsula, is more likely to maintain its presence by making further pressure on North Korea, including further economic sanctions, following the provocation. The decision by China`s National Oil and Security Agency to ban travel to North Korea by the North except Liaoning Province Thursday was also interpreted as a warning ahead of the attacks. Amid the inevitable deterioration in the relationship between North and China, it is also noteworthy whether North Korea's delegation will be sent to China's first global event, the Communist Party of China and a high-level meeting of the world`s largest political party since the second term of President Xi Jinping.

"▽ Dong-A Ilbo = As soon as police and Philippine authorities and the Air Force-Sagiquin are set to proceed with the handover procedure, the Korean Air Con-Air Team will repatriate 60 criminals who fled to the Philippines with their ` Korean Air Con-Air Project `. According to government sources Monday, the police plan to take delivery procedures from the Philippines to bring the criminals to the plane as soon as they are secured. The plan is being promoted as early as the end of this year with an estimated size of 60 people. "" We need at least two people to support the repatriation of prisoners per suspect, which is practically a charter to criminals, "" an official said. Earlier, Philippine police chief Ronald Della Rosa visited Seoul to discuss ways to help police chief Lee Chul-sung call in important fugitive criminals. The Kon-Air Project in Korea is credited with being the fruit of an international collaboration with Philippine security authorities. CONE AIr is a film about a 1997 film of the same name that describes a ' prison transport ' of convicted criminals placed in one place in a major U.S. prison. The complicated and complicated extradition procedures have resulted in the repatriation of two or three fugitive offenders overseas ; however, the relocation plan is unusual. The Phillippines, made up of more than 7,000 islands, are notorious for being the "" Emperor's refuge "" of Korean criminals because it is not easy to locate fugitive criminals. As of the beginning of this year, the number of Korean criminals fleeing to the Philippines exceeded 600. The number of Korean offenders who escaped from the Philippines increased to 84 last year from 33 in 2014 and 47 in 2015. Their crimes have also soared, prompting the Philippine police to open a Korean office since October 2010 and dispatching six Korean police officers to major bases in Ancheles, Manila. There are also various allegations ranging from violent crimes, such as murder and sexual assault, to fraud. A 40-something man allegedly sexually assaulted a minor at an exam court in 2010 was arrested by Philippine police as an illegal immigrant seven years after he escaped and was forcibly returned to Korea in May of 2010.

When you open the cover and put in the battery, the ‘ tick-talk ’ and the minute hand move. It also looks like an interior wall clock. But the inside is different. Included are a light bar to help secure vision and maintain body temperature, a whistle, flag and pressure for emergency medical care to warn of rescue requests and positions. This is Life Clark, a disaster safety kit introduced last August by Gyeonggi Corporation. As sales soared following the Pohang earthquake in North Gyeongsang Province, more than 10,000 cars were sold in less than four months. Kim Eun-ah (44, female), head of Gyeonggi Province's brokerage firm, said, "" I didn't have to leave it in a heavy, secluded disaster and put it in a place I could explain to myself, and put it in a place I could take it right away. "" When you open the lid of your watch, you will find disaster supplies. Kyonggi Province Corporation is a company formed by investing in Gyeonggi Province and local economic organizations. It helps small businesses plan, produce and promote their products and technologies but lacks design and marketing capabilities. Sometimes they even plan their own products like Life Clark. The development process was not easy. It took 7 to 8 months to consult not only disaster and disaster safety experts, but also 10 experts, including fire department, disaster product developers, and doctors, to consult and produce them. If he wanted to pack all of the products proposed by experts, he couldn't help but grow in volume. "" At the time, I was thinking about what to take out, not what to add, "" Kim said, adding, "" but I was concerned about the cost of living (disaster) bags, which are often quoted as inexpensive as being used for disasters, and the average weight of older children is 5 kilograms or more.

It also includes a 12-hour bar of bright illumination and pressure bandages for emergency treatment. All can be used many times, not disposable. It is particularly light at 1.07 kg, so it can be carried out easily in the event of a disaster. He even made a photo manual for children and the elderly to use easily.

The PISA test is designed to examine the performance of students in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries ' reading, math and science. In 2015, the survey was conducted to 540,000 15-year-olds students from 72 countries including the OECD, and 5749 Korean students (middle school seniors, high school seniors, and freshmen) participated.According to the analysis, the time limit per subject of PISA test is 60 minutes, but Korean students finished reading in 24 minutes, math in 24 minutes, and science in 28 minutes based on median.Median means the speed at which problem solving is for the student in the middle when he or she is ranked from the earliest to the last. The problem solving time for the three subjects is the fastest among 72 students. Our students ranked 4th through 9th in reading, 6th through 9th in mathematics, and 9th through 14th in science (lowest and highest in error range) out of 72.In Singapore, students who ranked first in the overall score level were found to have a slower problem solving time than reading 32 minutes, math 28 minutes, and science 37 minutes. Korean students are used to answering questions set in a limited time rather than a descriptive style, so they habitually solved the questions quickly. The nation's students ' performance ranking dropped from the previous levels in the PISA test in 2015, said, I should have tried to analyze the reasons more precisely but thought it would have been better if I had been able to solve the problem more thoroughly.Korean students also spent the least time in the world exercising due to tight schedules such as private academies. When asked whether they exercised during the last day of school, including those of OECD member countries, only 29.2 percent of Korean girls and 55.5 percent of male students answered. It is the smallest percentage of 55 countries.And Korean students went to school as a model. As of the last two weeks of the PISA test, I have been absent without leave, 1.9 percent of the students surveyed were the second lowest among 55 countries after Japan. In addition, 19.4 percent of Korean students said they were late to study PISA, the second lowest among participating countries.Yoo Dae-geun, reporter dynamic@seoul.co.kr"

The artificial cutting of rhinoceros horns and their release to nature to prevent poaching in advance is highly debated among even experts. Because life can be saved from poachers, but they can not protect themselves from predators.

""" The government will not be able to write off all debt owed by the 1,590,000 people who are in arrears for more than a decade. "" It is worth 6.2 trillion won based on the principal amount of debt. The primary criterion that the government considers insolvent is less than 60 % of median income. A household with a monthly income of approximately one person can be eligible for full debt relief if it is below 990,000 won. If the median income is over 60 percent, the reduction will be made to 90 percent of the original debt to help the debtor recover. Therefore, the maximum number of potential candidates who can be written off from their debts is 1.59 million, but in reality, it is estimated that approximately half of them will be written off. It is also notable that the government's budget was designed to avoid the debt cancellation process. However, since the new government's policy to completely forgive debt is unprecedented, it is expected that it will have repercussions in the implementation of the policy. The Financial Services Commission announced Monday a plan to support a long-term micro-defender comeback. The government's total debt write-off target is the national happiness fund and small long-term overdue debt obligation that is held by private or public institutions for at least 10 years and less than the original amount of 10 million won. The government estimated that the target audience will be 1.59 million. As of October 31 of this year, they have more than 10 years of overdue payment and less than 10 million won in debt. In short, they have selected only those who failed to repay debts before October 2007. Most of the long-term small overdue loans, including the private loan loan loan loan loan loan loan loan loan loan loan loan loan loan loan loan loan loan loan loan loan loan loan loan, were established to correct the debts of the past government. First of all, 830,000 people are in arrears with their debt altogether, which is subject to a total debt cancellation. The long-term debt delinquency rate held by private financial institutions and financial and public institutions, such as lenders other than the National Happiness fund, amounted to 760,000. In total, 1,152,000 people will be able to repay their debts if they are judged unable to repay income or property. The government also believes that since 10 million won can not be paid back for for over 10 years is practically a poorest person, it is good for the economy to provide a platform for recovery by completely canceling their debts and interests. At least 800,000 people should wait and see how their income is assessed, but the government estimates indicate that most of them are likely to fall into the poorest category. Among the 403,000 people who have received less than an exemption from the national welfare fund and who have not signed up to pay back the rest of their debts, approximately 46 percent of the 400,000 households with a monthly income of 10 percent or less were rated as median. The government will forgive the debt if it sees no repayment as it excludes living assets such as median income and cars with less than a ton of operating income. All 1.59 million people must undergo income evaluations to determine whether or not they will receive full debt relief. The government is also reluctant to estimate exactly how many people can receive full debt write-offs. However, if the national welfare fund's weak point of reference is extended to the whole extent, it is estimated that at least 800,000 out of 1,150,000 people will receive full debt relief. ▽ Greater benefits for patients with good faith = The measure is designed to provide greater benefits to patients with good faith who have paid off debts. 830,000 long-term debt delinquents who owe money to the national welfare fund will be divided into weak sperm. In 2013, the Korea Happiness fund purchased overdue bonds that would reduce its debt by 30-60 % when a delinquent debtor asked for it to adjust his or her debt, and by dividing the remaining debt by 10 years. In this way, the person who has been written off 30 to 60 percent of the principal as a condition of a small debt payment to the fund is the person who has had to pay off the debts. On the contrary, a weak sperm is a person who is in arrears without paying back a penny. The average debt of a weak sperm is 4.5 million won, which means it is overdue for about 14 years and 7 months. Rather than actually having deliberately paid off their debts, they failed to pay their debts due to their financial difficulties. The government will also forgive 427,000 sperm for not being able to repay all of the debts upon application. The 403,000 people who received the less than due date decided to cancel the collection of funds if the same conditions are met. The possibility of discovery of hidden assets has been a step in mind, said Lee Myung-soon, director of the Financial Policy Bureau at the Financial Services Commission at Samsung Group. The government will remove long-term overdue debt held by private financial institutions or public institutions for the sake of equity when it makes its request. However, this also makes a difference between those who are being repaid with good faith and those who are overdue. Among long-term delinquents whose overdue debt is transferred to private financial institutions (635,000) and financial public institutions (127,000), a total of 762,000 are in arrears. If they say they are the standard of debt cancellation, they should apply to the Korea Asset Management Corporation (KACO) and the Center for Mutual Savings and Finance. If the standard of debt cancellation follows an income evaluation, collection will be stopped immediately and overdue bonds will disappear in three years. To deal with overdue debt owed by the private sector and the public, however, the government has decided to establish an institution to purchase delayed bonds, operating at a separate time. It has a similar role to the national welfare fund, but instead it only buys overdue bonds and burns them. The fund will use the profits generated from the collection of bonds by the National Happiness Fund. The system is designed to eliminate the debt of long-term delinquents with the money of financial institutions instead of taxes. If the long-term delinquent, but he or she meets the criteria for the rest of the debt payment through the debt adjustment program of the Korea Credit Recovery and Recovery Commission, meets the criteria of the median income of less than 60 percent, the patient will be free from the debt loss for three years. Beginning next February, the government will receive applications from the Korea Asset Management Corporation and the Center for People's Finance. These institutions can receive an income assessment right away and will notify you if you are eligible for benefits within a month. There is no equity dispute, but the government actively reduced the overdue debt of less than 10 years, and reduced the amount of overdue debt by 10 million won or more, among others. It reduces debt by up to 90 %. Previously, debts were cut by 90 percent only to the poorest households, whose median income was less than 24 percent after the first 15 years of overdue payment, but this time, the standard was sharply lowered. The decision was made by the government since it is already a overdue bond purchased by the Korea Happiness Fund and it would be better to get it sorted out on time, since it does not cost extra money. The total number of people to be eligible for this criterion is one million. By their own judgment, they were reduced debt by 90 percent and paid back the remaining 10 percent, which means they have more options than before. However, some of them were excluded from the government's plan. Those who owe money to private financial institutions are under 10 years old. As for them, they have completely been excluded from the government's plan. The decision is in line with the government's policy to provide only long-term debt delinquents if they are exempt from paying off their debts. However, if the overdue loan period is as long as 9 years, the people who failed to receive benefits from the government will naturally complain. The chances of a successful government policy are, of course, depending on how many applicants there are. The National Happiness fund also received expectations and concerns when it was launched in 2013. Concerns have been raised that cutting the debt of the delinquent by 30-60 % goes against the market principle, and critics say this is a good way to help the delinquent debtor's recovery. However, it was not easy to follow through on the policy. Because of the nature of long-term delinquent borrowers, not many of them did not know that they were beneficiaries, and they could not afford to pay off the rest of their debts. In fact, only 582,000, or 20 percent, of 2.8 million people eligible for debt adjustment have received from the Korea Happiness Fund so far. A similar situation could recur this time around. Those who are in arrears for 15 years will be entitled to write off their debts due to the statute of limitations. If a delinquent debtor requests to write off his or her debts, it may be better to wait for the time when bonds are to expire because the collection is stopped and the bonds are burned in three years. The government is set to start a massive promotional campaign early next year. The government will promote the issue considerably so as not to be unaware of the fact that you are the beneficiary and won`t be left unbeneficed, Lee said.Financial Services Commission Chairman Kim Dong-wook yesterday briefings the government's Seoul Regional Office on support measures for the long-term micro-defenders.

The changes in the times were reflected in the increase of lone person households. The Environment Ministry announced on July 29 that it revised some of its guidelines to make the rate of waste more affordable, adding 1 liter to the size that local governments can sell as a pay-as-you-use household bag. Enforcement guideline states that small 1-liter bags are also available in the market for the food item on a use-based basis, but the smallest bag allowed for the household was ' 3-liter '. The Ministry of Environment issued a revision order to local governments, and small envelopes are expected to be sold nationwide from early next month when local governments finish follow-up measures such as revising the ordinance. The revision follows a change in consumer patterns since the introduction of the pay-as-you-go system in 1995, which saw sales of large envelopes fall and the public needs smaller envelopes. According to the National Statistical Portal's Population Survey, single-person households increased by about 64 percent from 3.17 million in 2005 to 5.2 million in 2015. Sales of 5-liter envelopes rose 93.5 % from 23.91 million in 2005 to 46.26 million in 2015, while those of 20-liter envelopes decreased from 288.23 million to 228.7 million.

If the government does not comply with the ministry's correction order, it will have to pay a penalty of 53 billion won ($ 13 million) and face punishment for violating the law on protection of dispatched workers.The Seoul Administrative Court Administration Department 3 (Director Park Seong-kyu) complained on July 28 against Paris Bagette's petition to suspend the suspension of the lawsuit, saying, "" As the order does not stop working properly, "" to ask the Employment Agency Director of Seoul. The rejection is the decision to terminate the trial without judgment on cases in which a suit or claim is filed without meeting the requirements or is not subject to judgment."" Although Paris Baguette's application is legitimate, the penalty is considered to be a breach of dispatch laws, not a violation of corrective instructions, "" the court said, "" so the penalties are not to be recovered and there is an administrative requirement.

The Korean Christian Bioethics Association issued a statement on July 7 expressing its opposition to the petition to end abortion, expressing its concern over the president`s stance on the issue on July 28. The Association said in its statement that "" with the Mother Health Act allowing abortions, the provision of criminal negligence is the only legal protection against abortion that protects the life of the unborn child. "" We are seeking alliances with other Christian and civic groups to raise our voices against the abolition of abortion, an association official said. hisunny@yna.co.kr"
"A lot of newly married couples who can not help their parents, get married before marriage to borrow money to get a house. / My wife and I did not do well last December to make a decision when we could afford to live. As the personality gap between the two families has been maximized, the relationship between the parents and the parents of the two companies has been strained. Naturally, I have been thinking about divorce, Kim said with a smile, I don`t think it would be a good idea to report the marriage. Kim did not register her marriage even though she has been married almost a year. As for the reason, I wanted to report marriage when I had a baby. I don`t feel the need to be quick. Thanks to her parents ' financial support, Kim was able to make the home without the loan, including a "" honeymoon marriage loan, "" which would have to be filed. "" I will do my best to keep the relationship in place, but I also thought I couldn't help but do something unless the conflict is resolved, "" Kim said, adding, If I parted, I have nothing to file.2. My aunt, who married in August of this year, had already reported her marriage in March, five months before her wedding. Both parents could hardly afford to contribute to the wedding, so they reported marriage early and arranged the honeymoon house with a loan to pay for the newlyweds. Lee said, "" I was going to do it anyway, but I've been hearing around me say, ' What did you do so fast? ' "" I am not ashamed to say, I did it on loan, so I was evasive. Lee's worries are also interest on mortgage loans. Having taken out several hundred million won in loans, Lee's salary is now about one-third of his salary goes into debt. Lee said, "" It is not easy even one billion won in recent TV programs as a prospective celebrity couple looks into their honeymoon house in southern Seoul. "" Watching the complaints like ` I should go and live in the countryside, ` I felt humiliated.As shown above, when newly married couples report their marriage, the gap between the rich and the poor is also growing. Both cases of deferring their marriage reports after their pre-marriage wedding have been worrisome. A couple who had delayed reporting on their marriage would easily think of divorce as ` complicated on paper anyway, ` and a couple who had filed a mortgage on their home mortgage early like Lee had thought.It is not just recent days that a wedding has to be reported after a wedding. Statistics from the National Statistical Office on July 28 showed that the highest percentage of living together, weddings, and marriage reports for married women aged 15-49 was ' marriage registration. ' The rate reached 75.1 % before 1994 and 2015. Although the rate has decreased to 61.2 % between 2010 and 15 years, it can be seen that the majority still report marriage to the public after weddings. In some cases, it may be natural to file a marriage report after a wedding, either. What is different from the past is the growing number of young couples who do not register to marry more than six months after the ceremony, but live in a de facto marriage. Recently, more people have been deciding whether to marry or not after a certain period of living. She also got into the spotlight by calling it the "" wedding internship program "" on TV. "" These days, many young couples do not report marriage to each other for more than a year, "" a divorce lawyer said. The couples who were asked to divorce have their first child together about three years after their wedding, and as a result of their tendency to report that they were born, they were more likely to have a divorce, "" said a marriage culture official.According to the 2016 judicial yearbook released by the Supreme Court, the number of couples divorcing during the years of their cohabitation has steadily decreased. In 2012, 8204 couples divorced, and in 2016, 22,457 couples were left in the South. Their divorce rate in the total divorce also dropped from 24.6 percent in 2012 to 22.9 percent. However, experts say that there is an empty stomach for the figures. "" Actually, there is a reason why the divorce decreased, but many couples did not register to marry and report that they did not divorce, "" said a divorce lawyer.More couples are cohabiting or having weddings first. The number of marriages reported earlier than cohabiting or weddings more than doubled to 11.1 percent in 2010 and 15 recently from the total of samples aggregated by the National Statistical Office (5.6 percent from 1994 to 2015). It is analyzed that the aim is to take active advantage of the benefits enjoyed by becoming a legal couple. With parents ' help hard to expect and limited in their finances, the parents are eager to make such choices as a costly wedding ceremony and a self-help measure for their honeymoon. They are struggling with skyrocketing housing prices and lending rates. According to the survey on the housing status in 2016 by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, the time it took to buy homes in the Seoul metropolitan area was the highest at 33.2 percent, or more than one in three years. Among those who spent less than one year, 26.1 % answered, 21.4 % in five to ten years, and 12.1 % in three to five years. This means that people who buy a house with the help of their parents should try for at least five years and 10 more. As the housing issue remains unsolved, it delays the birth, resulting in the social issue of low fertility rates. The world`s representative of youth Kim Soon-ok said, We need more support to reduce the qualification of a mortgage loan for newlyweds and provide happy housing for the newlyweds with more children.Nam Jeong-hoon, a reporter at che@segye.com and the Global Media World Daily anchor last month, had a healthy patient's prostate amputated.

"A Paris Baguette franchise is seen in Incheon. If the ministry imposes a fine after the deadline of July 5, when the direct employment of bread companies is due, Paris Bagette plans to raise an objection. There is a growing possibility that the courts will impose fines again.Some predicted that the amount of the fines would be significantly lower depending on the choice of bread machine operators. The amount of fines is reduced in proportion to the number of bread machine operators who refuse to pay for jobs. A company official said, The fines are a huge burden on Paris Bagette, adding, It will be set as a result of the bakery persuasion.◇ High Use Department, Paris Bagette coming up with a fine ... This is a protest.The judiciary and penalty imposition was affected by the court's decision. Earlier, Paris Baguette requested the Department of Employment to suspend the use of bread machines for workplaces, but the court decided to dismiss the executives yesterday.We will go into necessary measures when the correction order period ends, said a Goh.The fine will cost up to 53 billion won. A fine of 10 million won per bread machine maker 5309 can be imposed.Now Paris Baguette is an emergency. Paricrasse, which operates the Paris Baguette, reported 66.5 billion won in operating profit last year and 55.1 billion won in net income for the current term. There is nothing left over after paying a fine. Furthermore, the monetary asset is only 10.4 billion won.Industry sources had predicted that if the ministry imposed fines on Paris Baguette, it would object. If the court decides to send a penalty illegally, the fine will be suspended.Paris Baguette said, We have not received any notice from the Department of Employment and Employment on the issue of fines or legal proceedings yet, however, we have made an objection to the discussion.A baker cleans the baking machine at a Paris Bagette in downtown Seoul. / News 1 ©mediator Yoon-seong Yoon-seong-goo News must choose one of the bread companies who will decide whether to reduce the penalty or not : directly or with a third party joint venture or with a separate employer.Paris Baguette is pushing for a three-way partnership. Depending on the choice of bread machine operators, the amount of the penalty as well as the amount of the employment burden can be reduced.That is because the penalty is a structure that charges per person. As the number of bread companies refuse to use their products directly, the amount of money they have to pay decreases. If bread companies want a three-way partnership, the fines will decrease proportionally to the number, a ministry official explained.If more than half of bakery companies refuse to use their jobs at headquarters, the fines will be reduced to less than 27 billion won. Now, the partner companies say, "" About 60 percent of bread companies have chosen a three-way partnership. ""Earlier, about 30 Paris bargettes held a press conference at the Lions Association Hall in Dong-gu, Daegu, saying, I don`t think direct employment at headquarters is the best solution, and opposed direct employment.In fact, one bakery company said, "" It looks like most experienced bread companies would choose a three-way joint venture, "" adding, "" Considering job insecurity, professional use was not best. ""Reactions are also very strong. As the court decided, the headquarters should take up their duties, said an official at the Paris Bagette and the number of bread companies who joined the union was also on the rise.In response, industry officials say, after all, it is the point to persuade the bread companies to do so, adding, the more they join a third-party joint venture, the less pressure they put on Paris Bagette.Report!

"Agung Volcano erupted in 1963. At that time, the casualties were 1,500. After 55 years of silence, it began to flutter in September and is now on the brink of a volcanic eruption. There are about 800 people who are currently traveling there. There are also Korean residents. And the reason why we think this is important is because it's a volcano in the ring of the circum-pacific orogenic zone, which has 1,500 dormant volcanoes in it. Isn't the explosion of Agung volcano the start of a chain of volcanic eruptions in this ring of fire or a signal? That's what worries me. He lives near Agung volcano which is on the brink of an explosion. Let's connect with Hwang Hyang-mi, a Korean resident in Bali. Mr. Hwang, are you with me? ^ Hwang Hyang-mi > Yes, it is shown. ◇ How far do you live from Mt. Hwang Hyang Mi (> hwang ◆ mi . km jip) ; Our house is about 21 kilometers east of Agung Volcano. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > 21km Then, can you see the Agung Volcano from there? If you ride out of my house, you can see it immediately. But I can't see it from my home. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > A little way out. I saw the picture that I sent you by myself, and it looks very clear. How is the situation now, the situation now? So although it is not clear, the amount of smoke that is released has decreased. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > in rain. ^ Hwang Hyang-mi > ^ Yes. Something bigger was going to happen yesterday evening. "" So I evacuated people more quickly and did it all right, and I just got along. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : It has been a long night. I heard yesterday that volcanic ash, or magma, is boiling under the crater, folks, just rising up into the water vapor. I heard that the ash was coming out of the bubbling point even went to your house. Hwanghyangmi (photo : Korean residents in Bali) : Yes, but in 1963, I went down to my neighborhood and killed many people. Fortunately, there was no such damage in my neighborhood this time because the air was continuously flowing south. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > does not fly home, Ahn. Thank goodness, thank god. Sir, you live within sight of a mountain, so can I stay at home? ⑨ Hwanghyangmi > We are setting up a place to avoid using Ubud. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Have you set up a shelter yet? ^ Hwang Hyang-mi > ^ Yes. But I'm out here, but I don't think it's a problem, unless something big doesn't break out. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Until now, Dae-pil has been reduced to a radius of 10 kilometers? ^ Hwang Hyang-mi > Yes, it is. Kim Hyun-jung is staying at home until now because it is 21 kilometers away. But, as I said, when the volcano erupted, the lava flow went down to the town of 21 kilometers. Many people died in this town and people in this town were forced to flee by boat, so I guess they were a little nervous. If you come out now, you can see the water vapor of the volcano and see the boiling water. Since it is raining now, aren't these sulfur compounds falling to the ground completely? Maybe that's why I feel a little bit worse in my neck, eyes, and in this direction, and that's what's happening. Kim Hyeon-jung > Like fine dust is flying in the air, so you shouldn't feel thirsty and cough. Hwang Hyang Mi (> hwang ◆) ; Yes, my eyes are itchy and have coughs and do so. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Currently, 800 Korean tourists are bound up in Bali. How many Koreans are there? You can estimate the number of Korean residents is about 500. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > 500 min. The government is considering sending a charter plane. So, if you want to go to Korea, you can come by charter flight. Well, it's not that easy for Koreans, is it? ^ Hwang Hyang-mi ^ yes. In fact, it is a very safe area in the Denpasar area where Koreans live. So, I don't think Koreans will bother going out, but tourists should go there anyway. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. As a result, I checked with a Korean resident in Bali for a few minutes yesterday to find out what was going on. Mr. Hwang, we'll try to get in touch with you when it happens again. Thank you for your interview in today's difficult situation. Thank you for your efforts. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Hwang Hyang-mi who lives 21 kilometers away from Agung Volcano in Bali.

"▽ New South Korean and Hong Hyo-shik : At the National Assembly Hall in Seoul on July 29, Doubul-Bul Bulman Woo Won-sik (second), who attended a government-party consultation to prepare support measures for the long-due delinquent loan holders. From left, Lee Hak-young, secretary of the Presidential Committee on Political Affairs, Chairman of the National Assembly, Chairman of the Presidential Policy Committee on Foreign Affairs Kim Tae-nyun, Chairman of Financial Services Commission Choi Jong-koo. yesphoto@newsis.com Democratic Party chief policymaker Kim Tae-nyun made the remark at a briefing held at the National Assembly yesterday morning after a meeting between the ruling and opposition parties on long-term small overdue borrowers ' support. First of all, it will give full support to those who have been in arrears for a long time. If a delinquent debtor whose principal amount is 10 million or less or less in arrears, such as national welfare fund and financial company, is judged to have been unable to repay debts immediately based on their own application, it is judged that they are not able to pay it back immediately. The government and the government decided to push for an improvement in the system to prevent the occurrence of long-term debts to minimize the occurrence of long-term overdue loans, such as strengthening regulations on lending businesses, collection and sale of non-performing loans. To this end, the government will limit the mortgage loan regulations to prevent the mortgage lender from incurring an excessive repeat of delayed payment by creditors.The Act reinforced related regulations, such as the reckless extension of the statute of limitations by the financial circles, and improved the public service of the Small and Medium Enterprises Credit Guarantee Foundation to reinforce the protection of debtors in the process of collection and sale of delinquent debts. It also decided to strengthen support for the use of the perpetual debt adjustment system to help borrowers quickly get out of arrears. The government and the ruling party decided to remedy the traditional problems associated with the operation of the national welfare fund, such as improving the structure of the debt payment system paid by creditors with excess collection.

"" Phyeongnam to North Korea's 17 minutes at 3 a.m. an even tone. The missile, a vertical fire in the East in a flight for about 960 km and up to 50 minutes with an altitude of about 450 km. The missile, which appears to have a warhead on its second stage, flew the highest in terms of altitude alone. Experts say it is most likely that North Korea has increased its thrust for the maximum flight distance of the Type of Hwasong-14 rocket with an ICP-level range and for reentry tests. If the elder brother is correct, it will be the third time this year. The missile was 1.6 times higher than the NAT-14 missile, which was launched on July 4. The missile flew 933 kilometers in 39 minutes. The Mars-14-type plane was analyzed to have a height of 3,700 kilometers and a distance of 1,000 kilometers during its 45-minute launch on July 28. Experts disagree on how to estimate the maximum flight distance for the highest altitude of a ballistic missile, but generally determine the maximum flying distance of two to three times the highest altitude. If applied, it can reach a range of at least 90km when launched at normal angles, and up to 13,000 kilometers per hour. U.S. experts also estimated that the missile range of the missile was more than 13,000 kilometers, and the Japanese Defense Ministry also said it flew the longest ever. 5,000 kilometers by Alaska, the west coast of the United States in the North Korean donghae by 8,000 to about 200 kilometers. The missile launch is theoretically capable of striking the West Coast. South Korean and U.S. military experts have shared an assessment that the missile proved the maximum flying distance. Chang Young-keun, professor of Korean Air Force, said, "" I believe the test focuses on increasing the range with the third launch of the Hwasong-14 model, "" adding, "" If North Korea had made its warhead weight 200 kilograms or less, it would have been possible to weigh over 150km. "" The question is whether or not the missile successfully reentered the atmosphere. ICBMs have a high temperature of over 6,000 to 7,000 degrees on their way out of the atmosphere, and the most important technology is whether or not the warheads had been reliably hit.▽ Graphic : Washington D.C. (Combined News Agency) on North Korea's ICT-Washington (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) ; A U.S. missile launched by North Korea at 1:17 p.m. on July 28 (Washington time : 3:17 a.m.) bjbin@yna.co.kr will normally take some time to assess whether reentry has succeeded, a military official explained."" There is no way to verify the accuracy of the control and the technology of the car-inducing, chemical decantation of warheads in reentry, "" says Professor Suseong-14 of stereography, "" but the reentry techniques had to be launched in normal orbit. "" It is possible that the test could have been a successful and complementary test, as Kim Dong-yeop, director of the Far East Studies Center at Kyungnam University, said Li Young-ho, referring to as either confirming technology for launching peaceful aspects or confirming the preliminary inspection. Lyon, to visit New York for 72 round of the United Nations General Assembly, the last September issue of the North Korean Foreign Ministry Kim Jong-un the Party's chairman, Donald Trump the United States president's speech and the United Nations General Assembly.""Maybe the hydrogen bomb tests of the Pacific on what would you not to do ... think so."" says about his convictions and corresponding actions mentioned on it. Japan`s missile may fall off in several separate sections, leading to possible multiple missiles, but no confirmation. Some experts in Korea say that the first and second stage of the propellant flow has dropped. Professor Jang Young-keun of the U.S. ICP-Minitman said, "" The multiple rocket's top (PBV) weighed only about 1,000 kilograms, "" adding, "" If North Korea had not launched multiple ballistic missiles, it would have to be possible to change its shape, "" an existing Earther-14 missile. If reentry techniques are secured in the process of developing ICBMs, they are said to have actually completed the technology to transport nuclear warheads. Experts say North Korea's test launch of its third ICP-class missile this year is intended to secure such technology. If North Korea was confident that it had perfect technical issues during the launch, it would have to make an additional launch before the end of the year, Kim said in his New Year message. threek@yna.co.kr["
