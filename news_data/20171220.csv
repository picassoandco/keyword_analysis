[Yangju Fire Station] [Yonhap News Agency] Kwon Sook-hee : As the cold wave continues to freeze to less than 10 degrees Celsius, big icicles from buildings are busy being eliminated. Fire department officials urged people to report large icicles to 119 rather than directly remove them, as there is a risk of a crash. Fire authorities said Monday that they received 75 reports on removing icicles from Gyeonggi Province from the cold snap. On average, 10 times a day firemen are on duty to remove icicles. At 9:00 a.m. on July 18, a large icicle pillar was opened on the outer wall of an apartment in Deokjeong-dong, Yangju. The visible length of the icicles from below looked giddy with the length of nearly ten stories above the apartment. Firefighters took out every icicle that appeared along the windows from the third floor to the seventeenth floor at home. It took more than two hours to complete. Large icicles can pose a huge threat to the safety of citizens by appearing when cold weather comes up and then melting down when the weather goes away. To prevent such loss of life, houses or the water intakes of buildings should be inspected in advance for leaks. Also, be careful not to make icicles as water flows from the same wave accident. Firefighters said they expected more reports to be made when the winter cold begins. If you find a large icicle that is frequently formed during the winter, be sure to report it to the fire department to be safely eliminated, said an official at the fire department in northern Gyeonggi Province.▽ Operation against Icicles (Jangpong = Yonhap News Agency) = Large icicles column appeared at an apartment in Yangju, Gyeonggi-do on July 18, and firefighters are removing it. [Company's Best News Supply : [Company's Best Information Supply = SK Telecom] suki@yna.co.kr [Information tip and inquiry (Click!)] ▶ Set up a comprehensive list of trends in the market and wait for the change in the money supply center [Money Tuday's preferred reporter] If real estate regulations are strengthened and the volume of housing increases, it is expected that apartments will be priced more than a month ago. Whether to buy it now or to see the market next year is worrisome. Although the government has proposed measures to boost the incentive of rental housing for multiple home owners to control the real estate market, it is expected that the price stabilization in Seoul will not be easy. As the preference of the best regions is highlighted due to stricter regulations, the price hikes in major areas of Seoul are increasing. Some market watchers diagnosed the growing number of prospective buyers as buying before it even goes up. According to the actual market price of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport on July 19, the reported transaction price of Raemian Oksu Libergen 84.81 ㎡ in Oksu-dong, Seongdong-gu, Seoul was 977 million to 988 million won. Since then, there has been no reported transaction, but in October, the transaction was traded at 1.06 billion won and 1.19 billion won, respectively, which led to the sale of 1.2 billion won. The prices of the Han River visible floor are set to be sold for 1.55 billion won, exceeding 1.2 billion won. The small-size average number of 59.25 ㎡ was also traded at 870 million won (i.e., the fifth floor) this month, up 70 million won from the same period last October.It is difficult to buy an 84 ㎡ house with less than 1 billion won, said an official at a local administrative agency in Oksu-dong, a 59 ㎡ small store. As for the reasons for the price hikes, the official said, There are many loose money in the market and many people are willing to buy apartments in Seoul. According to KB Kookmin Bank's housing statistics, Seongdong-gu, Seoul saw the highest price increase among 25 districts on Monday, selling apartments 0.42 percent higher than Jeonju. Songpa-gu and Gangnam-gu, which are 4 districts, also increased by 0.34 percent and 0.32 percent, respectively, significantly outstripping Seoul's average 0.17 percent. "" Because regulations on multiple home owners are tightened, I feel like I have to leave only one thing in a profitable Gangnam area, "" said Molly, who has a home in Gangnam.The government has repeatedly announced measures to protect itself, but the reason why the prices remain firm and rise is because it expects at least more sales in major areas of Seoul, and the polarization of regulations is taking place, said one market analyst.Some analyze that one of the main reasons that the government's regulations are not enforced is due to the wide gap between the government and the market. Government policy makers are encouraging multiple homeowners to save taxpayers ` money and reduce the cost of registering rental housing on the premise that the housing market is stable next year. However, the market expects that the price of rental houses will be much larger than the tax burden when the price goes up in the near future, so they are reluctant to register rental houses."" As the market price continued to rise, the expectation of higher market prices would at least continue to grow, "" another market analyst said, "" as the market has been adjusted, the market is likely to face a boom in Seoul. "" What you see next door is a free comic strip and a gift batter! ▶ Cheerleader vs. Racing Girl Bae Kyu-min bkm@mt.co.kr< Only five of the 16 patients were given the sap, excluding one of whom were all killed. The results showed that the antibiotic resistance bacteria found in the three dead was caused by the same strain. The possibility of bacterial infection is weighed during the course of creating or administering sap. A team of six outside experts, including Kim Nam-jung, infection doctors at Seoul National University Hospital, held a conference on July 18 and 19 to review the results of a mandatory antibiotic therapy session, and found out that three of the deaths were caused.Five out of 16 premature babies in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit were injected with nutrition therapy (TPN) and the same amount of vitamin therapy as usual on July 16, according to the research team. TPN is a nutrient that is injected through the central vein of the clavicle or thigh. Write the food to the baby who can not pass it on. Pharmacist makes it by mixing carbohydrates and protein directly. Smooprefide is an injection containing omega-3 fatty acids. Another hospital patient, B, was also receiving TPN and Smoof Ripid, but he stopped working on July 14. The TPN that doctors gave to the children on the day of the accident was made in the pharmacy on the first basement floor of the hospital on the fifteenth. Usually, the baby is prepared and sealed on the same day and sent to the neonatal intensive care unit on the 11th floor, but he made it for the third day at the same time because it was Friday before the weekend. Shortly before administration, intensive care nurse mixed up the drug with SMP and prepared an injection device to administer vitamin K. All these procedures shall be carried out in a sterile environment. On July 15, all five babies who received TPN and others showed little abnormal symptoms. However, starting around 5 p.m. on July 16, Mr. A showed abnormal symptoms such as a rapid breathing, pulse rate and low blood pressure. Two hours later, Miss C (three weeks of age) showed the same symptoms, and by 9 p.m., Miss D (five weeks of age) and Miss E (one week of age) were born. He did not listen to CPR or antibiotics. They died sequentially beginning at 9:32 p.m. They were all children who received TPN, Smoof Rippide and Vitamin K on this day. As a result, the team was told that the infusion or injection agent was released into the seat while mixing TPN and smorprophide or inserting a needle into the bottle to put vitamin K was found. It is relatively unlikely that the pharmacist caught the bacteria during the TPN preparation. On July 15, after administration of TPN, no symptoms were found, and other medicines made in the same pharmacy did not cause problems. After analyzing the bacteria detected from three people, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted an accurate analysis, the sequence of gene bases was consistent. That means it originated in the same place. The pseudobacter prundy is fatal to premature babies who are gentle in a healthy human body but have little immune system. Jang's cells can cause severe inflammation or blood poisoning that dies and can cause death instantly. It is more reasonable now to believe that bacterial infections are the cause of death than other causes, said Dr. Gitlan, a professor at the National Cancer Center who is participating in the research team. Meanwhile, police searched Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital on the same day. Professor Cho (44, female), who was the doctor of death, and intensive care nurse, will be summoned soon.Cho Geon-hee, reporter of becom@donga.com and Lee Ji-hun, official Facebook"

In the announcement of the deportation, Chinese fishing boats equipped with iron bars and wire nets rushed to the patrol boat, and the Coast Guard's task force fired warning shots from 9:15 a.m. However, the crew explained that the ships scattered randomly and did not respond to the deportation order. Maritime police launched 21 individual K2 rifles, 180 guns of public firearms, and 12 non-seismic gauges, using four patrol vessels of 3,000-ton, 150-ton and 1,000-ton class.

The boats fled from Korea`s waters at 2:43 p.m., about 5 1/2 hours after firing. The damages on the Chinese fishing boats were not confirmed, and no damage was reported to have been done to the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard believes that they tried to operate illegally using unfavorable weather conditions. Under the law, ships or criminals can use public firearms in addition to personal firearms to attack security forces using dangerous objects such as hull, weapons and weapons. In addition, the Act was enacted last month to "" attack "" the security forces, and to "" harm the security forces collectively or cause them to use it in accordance with three or more scheduled or mobile orders.

It is an unavoidable phenomenon. As a result, the speed of smartphone processing is not as good as before.In most cases, I think "" It's time to replace my old phone. ""But what if this is a little bit different? What if you deliberately lowered the performance of your smartphone operating system to match your battery? It is a little annoying for consumers.Apple has been embroiled in this controversy recently. The controversy is that once the battery is older than a certain level, iOS performance is limited.The Apple smartphone has raised controversy over an allegation that it intentionally blocked the performance of an older model after a certain time. The latest model of the iPhone, the iPhone X. (Photo = Cinet), was first claimed on July 9 (local time). "" The iPhone slowed down, "" he said on the social news site Reddit. Change the battery "" was the trigger. Reddit's Hot Side was the iPhone 4S user. He claimed to have changed the battery on the sluggish iPhone 6Gb/s and then returned to its old speed.The controversial benchmark app founder, John Poole, was the one who started the company. He backed Reddit up based on the results of the benchmark tests. (Go straight to the article John Poole) ■ "" I guess I adjusted my performance by the age of the battery "" So why did this happen?U.S. foreign media, including Asteknicker, noted Apple's iOS update measures last February.At that time, users complained about the battery suddenly being down on their old iPhones. An error occurred when the battery was 30 percent full and suddenly went out.Apple has updated iOS 10.2.1 to solve the problem. IOS 10.2.1 There has been a significant reduction in the sudden down of the battery after deployment.Apple is believed to have deliberately restricted performance of its older models when it released iOS 10.2.1, which resolved a battery down phenomenon last February.Apple claims the iPhone 6 S's decreased 80 percent and the iPhone 6's 70 percent.John Poole argues that the performance of the older iPhone 6 and 6Gb/s decreased from this time on. Apple most likely has limited its iOS performance to prevent the battery from being down.There is another notable claim from John Poole.Until the beginning of this year, the iPhone 7 was free from degradation. In other words, the iPhone 7 performance in iOS 10.2.1 remained unchanged.The results of the iOS 12.1 and iOS 10.2.1 iPhone 6Gb/s Benchmark Test (photo = geeky Vench), but things have changed since the iPhone 8 was released two months later, iOS 11.2. After installing iOS 10.2.1, the iPhone 6Gb/s has become a similar situation.Based on this evidence, John Pool argued that Apple is presumed to intentionally limit its performance when updating its iOS device to reflect the age of the battery. IOS developer Guilherme First, who was also interested in the criticism that "" leading to a new product purchase as a battery exchange is an issue, "" also dug into the issue. He argued that Powerd was the main cause of the iPhone's degradation.He claims that the code controls the speed of the CP GPUU and the power usage depending on the condition of the iPhone battery.Of course, Powerd acts as a safety device to keep Apple devices, including the iPhone, from firing. However, he also plays a role in significantly reducing the performance of the device when the battery condition worsens, he argued.U.S. business magazine Forbes noted, "" The problem is not the presence of the Powerd code. What is more serious is that the customers do not know this.John Pool was more direct in his criticism of Apple's deliberately lowered performance. Apple's duty is to let you know that the poor performance of its iPhones is due to batteries, and Apple is to pay about $ 1,000 to cover such obligations and correct it to pay support.Of course, there is another argument. IT media, Astechnica, also reported, "" We conducted a similar experiment with the iPhone 7, which runs out of battery in a day, but we have not seen any degradation. ""Apple has not offered any explanation for the problem.

The announcement was made on July 19 during an interview with NBC, U.S. that it confirmed that it would delay the training until the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and the Paralympics next year and proposed to the U.S. government. This is a strategic breakthrough to create a security environment that allows the North to relax its extremely tense situation on the Korean Peninsula due to repeated provocations and hold the Peace Olympics. If North Korea responds to this request and puts off further provocations and sends the North Korean delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, a major turning point of the tide of the current situation on the Korean Peninsula will be created. Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, the South Korea-U.S. military exercise is the president's performance the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics is proposed to the United States 'peaceful Olympics' and start digging the foundation to take to the cause.to exist Just as the resolution was adopted at the General Assembly last month, it is intended to delay the Korea-U.S. military training that could provoke North Korea and cause military tension in order to secure the Olympics. Although the Key Resolve exercise and Eagle training, usually held in March, will not coincide with the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics periods (Feb. 9-25), it is most likely that the Paralympics will occur during the period from March 9-18. So far, a postponement of training exercises on the CFC has been suggested as an idea to engage North Korea in a dialogue table. Moon Jung-in, president of Unification, Foreign Affairs and Security advisor in the Adenauer Foundation for the success of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics at the seminar held in Germany last September to April 3 the next year.Disruption or reduction in the joint exercises to discuss which claims it can. But the president is directly after Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in the United States requested a delay of the joint South Korea-U.S. military exercises that this is the first time. Some say such a proposal is a plausible scenario. Analysts say the U.S., the partner of the annual training, will most likely see a reduction in tension on the Korean Peninsula as an event involving its athletes. The president said, ""On the part of such a proposal to the United States and the United States is already considering."" If the Korea-U.S. military drills are delayed, some in North Korea are expected to stop testing nuclear or missile programs that are likely to draw international criticism during the Olympics. Moon Jae-in, president, nbc (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) interview, Moon Jae-in the president, Pyeongchang Winter Olympics host to the United States within the dedicated high speed train, 'train one' president.Doing an interview with broadcaster nbc. It is noteworthy that such a card is not just about hosting the Olympics but also about the Korean Peninsula. If the ROK and the U.S. call off their military drills and North Korea decides to abandon their nuclear and missile tests, a painting similar to China's proposed double-disciplinary theory is created. The group says North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations along with the halt of the South Korea-U.S. joint military exercise. Analysts say that this could create an environment where North Korea can engage in dialogue as the overall situation on the Korean Peninsula begins to ease. If North Korea freezes its nuclear and missile provocations until the Pyeongchang Olympics, the U.S. will regard them as a signal for direct talks and actively participate in the talks. The president early on the 'ssangjungdan' approach the progress of the way he could, in a roundabout way in. (cna) Asian news channel aired last September of last month, Singapore is the president said in an interview with North Korea's nuclear and missile provocation and to step 1 could come into dialogue.A nuclear freeze, North Korea's nuclear programs in the next step for the disposal, including South Korea and the United States for the international community commensurate measures may be able to discuss. '' The president such proposal is for North Korea's Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games to provide a rationale to lead the soft approach gesture that you want to really mean. If North Korea decides to delay its military drills and avoid provocation until the Pyeongchang Olympics, the possibility of North Korea participating in the Pyeongchang Games is expected to grow stronger. The president said the president, Sports and head of the press conference with the dedicated high speed train in a case of the past, North Korea is almost to take part.See would be the last minute. plan to ""and"" continues to preach about the pitch by then. The government is also patient. If the de facto pair of two parties are accepted, China is more likely to persuade North Korea to participate more aggressively. If North Korea participates in the Olympics, it is expected to be a significant breakthrough not only in the North American relationship but also in improving inter-Korean relations. But the president such review is whether the national military performance of the sophisticated and go through the early coordination with the United States if it is questionable. It is possible that the two allies will voice different opinions over the postponement of the Korea-U.S. military drill or cause a controversy over a failure. The biggest problem is that North Korea is still likely to make further provocations by emphasizing its status as a nuclear power. In this case, the president strategic victory of the entire Korean Peninsula, and have been fruitless, but the flow of the situation is concern that possible. In an interview the president the ""All this will be possible if North Korea depends on how you act."" and ""Only that North Korea that depends on the issue."" high.It is stressed this context. kind3@yna.co.kr The meeting between the Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital and the family of the four babies who died at 2:00 p.m. on July 20 began at 2:13, but was stopped after about 30 minutes.

The Incheon District Public Prosecutors ` Office announced yesterday that seven executives and employees of U.S. mining agency and the top investor in the company have been indicted on charges of violating laws on fraud and door-to-door sales. Prosecutors indicted Park and three other chief executives of the advertising subsidiary of Mining Max without physical detention on charges of embezzlement and appointed four top investors who escaped. They are accused of double-dealing more than 18,000 investors with the money they received from the machines that produced virtual currency, ' This is the case. ' This is the second largest virtual currency in the world, after Bitcone. To get new virtual currency, one must solve difficult formulas, such as math problems. The machine is a high-performance computer machine that solves the password. After recruiting investors in a pyramid manner, mining Max paid a recommendation allowance and a mining allowance to senior investors who attracted sub-investment. Investors were called in seven classes, according to the number of extractors they purchased, from "" regular investors "" to "" 1-5 stars "" to "" honorary graduates. "" The contenders for the trial were the top investors at the foot of pyramid with ' 4 Stars ' and ' 5 Stars. 'Top investors received at least 100 million won to 4 billion won per person in compensation for the Rolex watches and pure gold necklaces that Mining Max gave top investors. Aside from the allowance, the outstanding individual also received foreign cars such as Benz, luxury watches, and a pure gold necklace. Mining max spent only 75 billion won on mining equipment out of 270 billion won received from victims, and the rest in return for paying top investors who have raised funds or invested in creating subsidiaries. The 100 billion won amount was held overseas by executives at Mining Max, the prosecution estimated. However, the payment was delayed due to the fact that the number of investors could not get as many virtual coins as possible, and the chairman and the chairman decided to avoid paying the top investor back with the funds of the bottom tier. Mining Max owned 11 subsidiaries all, including three fund management companies, three computer management firms, two customer management firms, two mining and PR agencies. Among these affiliates, computer management firms cheated investors by developing a computer program that could manipulate virtual money as if it were being extracted. Singer Park is suspected of taking the helm of a public relations agency and diverting more than 450 million won in funds from the company from August to October this year.

Samsung Electronics announced on July 20 that it would produce the world's first 10-nano, one-generation (1-y) DRAM chip. Samsung was the only Korean competitor to enter the mid-10nano technology, while their competitors struggled with mass production of 10-nano DRAM. Some say that the company built an impenetrable fortress for Chinese companies that launched low-cost attacks, dreaming of becoming a "" semiconductor maker. ""A product of ' 1Gb nano process based DDR 4D RAM ', where Samsung Electronics begins mass production for the first time in the world. / The most fair market for memory semiconductor companies, including Samsung Electronics provided D RAM technology, is the most fair market technology. A leading fine process can provide more chips with higher performance at lower production costs.Samsung's competitors, SK Hynix and Micron, are still having difficulties in mass production of 10-nano DRAM chips. SK Hynix, the second-largest company in the industry, has developed and shipped 10-nano DRAM chips, but is said to be unable to secure the most important amount of production and yield.Some say that due to the mass production plan, the gap between Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Micron has widened from the previous year to two years. Micron has recently started the first generation of 10th nano-class DRAM production, which Samsung announced in its seaweed, and the second generation of 10 nanoclass DRAM chips is expected to be possible only in the next year.▽ Samsung Electronics ` semiconductor factory = / Samsung's second-generation 10-nano DRAM chips is usually referred to as y, which stands for the mid-10nano (15- 17) level. The 10 nanometers to 20 nanometers in the second half is referred to as 1x and the 20 nanometers to 22 nanometers.Fine-to-three process differences, such as y, 1x and z, make a big difference in terms of productivity, power efficiency, and speed. ▽ Generation 2 = Ten nanoscale DRAM has about a 30 percent higher productivity than the first generation DRAM. This means that one wafer, the raw material for the semiconductor, can produce 30 percent more chips than before. Power efficiency and speed are also 10 percent higher than traditional products.There is no more DRAM chicken games. As chicken games that hurt the profitability of rival companies began to flourish in the late 2000s by increasing supply volume and lowering prices, Kimonda, a German memory powerhouse, collapsed and leading Japanese memory company Elpida collapsed.The electronics industry says it is unlikely that Samsung will be able to play the chicken game again due to its dominance. In the past, the technology gap between leaders was about a year at the 6 month level. However, with Samsung creating a huge gap of two to three years with its second-generation 10-nano processes, the game of chicken racing to kill itself in volume will not have been established.China's chase after Korea, which has its eye on the DRAM market, has become extremely difficult. As Samsung Electronics introduces a higher-performance semiconductor manufacturing process at a lower price each year, it is hard for the Chinese government to achieve early.[Hwang Min-kyu, reporter, durchman@chosunbiz.com]chosunbiz.com"
"▽ Korea's Driving Technologies, Kyung-Do & Fusion Technology Institute, and Korean mini-bus platforms developed after three years of research based on the ` Zero shuttle ` during the year ; Minibus Industry and Energy Conflicts Restinated to Eye & Ears The province is in the process of certification for the trial run of the Autonomous Driving Bus ' Zero Shuttle. ' Once certified, the bus will run 5.5 kilometers from the entrance of the new IT industrial complex to Pangyo Zero City on the new subway line. The nation's first autonomous driving shuttle, developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology (IPI) at the request of Gyeonggi Province, will start test runs downtown as early as this year. The Zero shuttle is an 11-seat mini-bus developed by the next-generation convergence technology research institute (Gongwon) commissioned by Gyeonggi Province based on three years of research. It is the first bus made by a maid in Korea, titled ` The First Autonomous Driving Bus in Korea `. However, if you look inside, things are different. The bones, skin, and muscles of buses were all manufactured by Korean businesses, but most of the core technologies for autonomous driving, which serve as the eyes, ears, and nose, belonged to foreign businesses. No Korean company has enough technology to trust drivers and leave them to their own drivers. Cameras for Autonomous Vehicles and the Radar · Lidar sensors are key parts to replace the driver's perception. It is as important but the most backward area for Korean technologies. A pre - and rear-cameral sensor, like the human eye, is equipped with Israeli mobile eye products. The antenner-shaped device on the four corners of the Zero shuttle is equipped with Lyda sensors, which use light to measure distances and detect objects, is a product of German companies Thick and Aibeo. Graphic : journalist Park Kyung-min minn@joongang.co.kr and developer Rheida Sensor of the world`s No.1 lidardin and U.S. Novatel Satellite Navigation Calibration System (DGPS) are installed on the shuttle roof. Inertia navigation system (INS), which measures the information of bus acceleration, direction, and distance, is also a product of the UK company Oxford Technical Solutions. It is fortunate that the software that controls the Zero Shuttle has been developed by the software industry itself. As such, although the core parts of the sensor were imported from abroad, the frame and chassis frame were produced by Korean manufacturers Contech E&M and Daechang Motors. Local manufacturers also created unmanned steering, braking, and driving systems that run or turn themselves without human hands on them, and cameras to monitor the situation outside. It is relatively easy to develop compared to sensors. The nation's first autonomous driving shuttle, developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology (IPI) at the request of Gyeonggi Province, will start test runs downtown as early as this year. Kim Jae-hwan, director of autonomous driving research at Won-Won Park, said, We can not afford to help domestic companies ` products because we don`t have the technology to meet global standards. Korea's autonomous driving technology is evaluated to have been lagging by four to five years compared to the U.S. due to sluggish development of key technologies such as sensors. "" I was less interested at home because of low demand, and I was more interested in buying and using foreign products than developing them myself, "" Kim said. "" As a result, I ended up spending less time and less money on technology. "" This means that the company has put more effort into what is profitable than the core technology, which needs a lot of time and money to develop. Lee Ho-keun, an optician at Daedeok University, said, "" We should be able to focus on the achievements of domestic automotive technology this year, rather than on the skills that will generate substantial added value in 10 years. "" The nation's first autonomous driving shuttle, developed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology (IPI) at the request of Gyeonggi Province, will start test runs downtown as early as this year. Fears are growing in the industry. Companies that focus on autonomous driving technologies such as Google and Uber plan to start commercialization of the car around 2020, but domestic companies do not start trial operations until last year. "" There is a great deal of concern that in the field of autonomous driving, regarded as one of the key industries of the fourth industrial revolution, we are already lagging before autonomous vehicles start commercialized, "" an industry official said. Some also point out that the inefficient structure of the Korean automobile industry is a fundamental problem. Professor of Business Administration at Seoul National University Kim Soo-wook said, "" Everyone knows that autonomous driving skills are important and that we should spend money on research and development (R&D) to solve the problems of future conflicts between employers and employees, and that we can not afford to pay more.

If the three major opposition parties, the Korean Free Trade Party and the U.S. Minjoo Party, do not act before the full-fledged election, the existence of the party could face a crisis. At the same time, it is virtually impossible to convince the Honam region's high-ranking officials that the unification would result in losing their political standing.Ahn has been saying that the current existence of the right party is the right time to expand the middle ground and that next year's local elections will be a test bed for moderate forces. Meanwhile, he expressed his concern, "" If the right party dies out as a result of the suspension of the discussion, the Grand National Party will have a greater chance of becoming the first party, and the Democratic Party will also be able to shake its people's party. "" Ahn said on July 19, "" If the unification work is stopped, the ruling party will continue to pull out lawmakers from the National Assembly through endless maneuvering. "" His opinion is that political parties that failed to expand outside before the national elections or failed to expand outside due to opposition from inside will die out.However, he is known to have expressed his lack of understanding with the ruling party's anti-communist faction, saying, "" We have no choice but to break the law recently. "" Ahn was well aware of the situation when the opposition camp reached its limit, Ahn said, adding, I tried to end the controversy with a multiple number of jeans.On the same day, Ahn said, If there is anyone who wants to stand in the way of the future and focus on the political interests of individuals, we should clearly distort the spirit of Honam democracy. It is like asking for political choice for anti-Communist figures, which means we can not but divide if we can not be together, party officials said. As Ahn's party members voted for a national convention in January, the time for unification has become much quicker. The former party member voting is possible when a party member's voting requests are made on major policies and issues of the party according to the rules of the National Party's constitution or party constitution or by the relevant committee. The executive committee shall decide by the attendance of a majority of the incumbent members and the approval of the majority of the other members who are present.

"A U.S. study says batteries are responsible for slowing the speed of the older iPhone, which critics say … leading to buy a new one.In particular, Apple is expected to raise controversy as it has been found to intentionally restrict iPhone performance when the battery is aging to a certain extent. U.S. IT media Seanett cited data analysis results collected by its benchmark App Geekbench on July 19 (local time) and suggested that older iPhones were more likely to experience poor performance.There are reports that the battery is responsible for slowing down the older iPhone. (Photo = Cinette) founder John Poole collected the iOS version with the geeky vench app (iOS 2.10, iOS 10.2.1, iOS 10.2.1, and iOS 11.2.0, respectively) and the iPhone benchmark by extension.The graph shows the number of terminals on which the X-axis scored the benchmark and the Y-axis scored the benchmark. The experiment showed that the more recent versions of iOS have resulted in higher changes in the benchmark scores of the iPhone 6Gb/s and the iPhone 7.In iOS 2.10 and iOS 10.2.1, the iPhone .- benchi benchmark test results (photo = geekbench), the iPhone S with iOS 2.10, saw a graph of only about 2,500. However, the iPhone 4S with iOS 10.2.1 and iOS 11.2.0 had an unusual pattern, with its graphs distorted.The same was true of the iPhone 7 Venchamark score.As a result of the iPhone 6Gb/s benchmark test with iOS 11.2 (photo = geekbench), he cited aging cell phone batteries as the cause. He explained that the iPhone 6Gb/s and iPhone 7 batteries installed in iOS are not capable of producing reliable output.The experiment shows that the cell phones are slower than the ones that slowed down, so it is better to think that the batteries need to be replaced, Jon Full said.He also deliberately agreed that Apple, which is pushing forward with the new iPhone, is delaying the sale of the new product, saying that the price of the benchmark between iOS 2.10 and iOS 10.2.1 is too high.Lee Jeong-hyeon : Please subscribe to Jidinet Korea via Naver. kane@yna.co.kr Suspected ` Sap Pollution ` … Experts Are Most Possible "" and Newborn Infection-Agent and Newborn Infection-Infection Drugs Kim Gil-Won, a medical reporter at Ewha Womans University Hospital The antibiotic resistance bacteria found in the blood of three infants who died was confirmed to be genetically identical, and is believed to have originated from an infection. Experts suspect the sap that was supplied to most infants in intensive care units was one of the causes of infection. There is also a possibility of infection by doctors and nurses. Eventually, the possibility is expected to be confirmed through police investigations. However, no matter what the results come out, Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital is likely to be held liable for infection control.Choi Pyeong-cheon, a reporter at the Korea Open News Agency, said, "" I heard that four newborns died one after another in an accident at Ewha Womans University's Mok-dong Hospital on July 18 and that of a newly hatched baby died in an accident. A family member is crying. pc@yna.co.kr (December 18, 2001) ◇ Strange.com, the suspected "" sap pollution "" … The most suspected source of infection among experts is the contaminated sap. Sap is vital to the feeding of all premature babies. Infectious doctors say the sap is infected with an antibiotic resistance bacillus, Cetrobacter Frundi, which, at the same time, could lead to fatal accidents. In this case, it is more likely that the sap was contaminated at the factory, rather than at the hospital, in the process of dividing it into doses suitable for infants. In the case of newborns, the process involves the process of adjusting the capacity to their weight and mixing glucose, protein, and vitamin components. A team of epidemiological investigators commissioned by two of the university's Mok-dong Hospital by outside experts confirmed that they had received more of the same comprehensive nutrition solutions and injections as the four children who died under their own scrutiny. ""Citrobctor peurundi the natural environment and healthy people, such as water or soil of the bacteria normally present in their stomach"" he said, "" in the hospital is a professor at Seoul National University Hospital division of infectious diseases omyeongdonCitrobacter, which in the natural environment from preparing to 'accident', such as the injection peurundi the chances are that he entered. "" An infectious physician professor at another hospital who requested anonymity said, "" If the infusion was injected into a newborn that was contaminated with bacteria, it would have been possible to immediately spread the fungus and determine where it affected the heart rate in multiple ways. "" However, it is questionable whether some of the children who received the sap in question must have solved it by the end of the day 16, after having received no symptoms. Regarding this, an official at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital refused to comment on the reasons for the death, saying, It is not yet the stage to be able to determine or comment. Police Prosecution-Sin Joon-Hee (Yonhap News Agency) at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital : Officials of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency are wearing sanitary attire before searching for the infant intensive care unit. 1.17.12.19 hama@yna.co.kr A doctor, nurse, and infant product could have been contaminated with bacteria and exposed to multiple babies due to lack of overall care at hospitals. Though it is difficult to determine that bacteria were detected in the blood of a dead infant, it is hard to say that the hands of doctors or baby goods were the cause of direct infection, and that the past cases of intensive care for infants can not be easily considered. Setrobactor Frundi is not causing any major problems for normal people, but can cause infections in less immune infants and patients. Humans are usually infected with healthcare-related infections, and several cases have been reported in the past with the spread of germs through the hands of medical staff. In particular, the fungus has the characteristic of causing central nervous system infections in newborns. If germs have spread to the infant's central nervous system through caregivers, death could occur in a short time, one expert analyzed. Earlier, some of the guardians raised suspicions about poor management of the neonatal intensive care unit by saying, "" I got bitten by a pastiche in a basket as it was. "" In reality, it is also reported that infant products are contaminated with superbacteria (multiconductant resistant bacteria) in the country. In the past, a large general hospital in Korea detected a large number of linens that could develop from sheets (linen) to superbacteria, resulting in the replacement of the linen that is in use. bio@yna.co.kr"
"Prosecutors arrested 15 prosecutors in July and December for questioning and found that 15 suspects were not prosecuted or detained, and the Supreme Public Prosecutors ' Office announced yesterday that prosecutors ' Office and the Supreme Public Prosecutors ' Office arrested prosecutors. According to the prosecution, the prosecution's half of the prosecutors ' office conducted an investigation into the recruitment scandal between July and this month, and arrested 15 people and detained 15 others. The prosecution launched an investigation in July by reinvesting the case to the National Public Prosecutors ` Office after receiving requests from six public agencies, including the Board of Audit and Inspection and the Financial Supervisory Service, for questioning. Major cases of recruitment irregularities were _ asking _ _ and parachuting _ _ _ and taking _ the omission of nuclear weapons from the women's cities and provinces. Officials of the institution were found to have committed the crime by increasing the number of potential employees hired by an acquaintance, manipulating interview scores and making or modifying the conditions and procedures to recruit parachute. The Seoul Southern District Public Prosecutors ' Office indicted former FSS official Lee Byeong-sam last year on charges of accepting favors from incumbent bank presidents, modifying the applicants ' interview scores, and passing applicants who failed the personality test. Lee Moon-jong, former chief of the FSS ` general affairs bureau, was also prosecuted for hiring new employees in 2015 by Kim Yong-hwan, the head of the NHCF financial holding company, and admitted to higher recruitment scores in interviews for his vice president.Lee Byung-sam, former vice chairman of the Financial Supervisory Service, is in Seoul for screening for a warrant at the Seoul Southern District Court Friday. Suncho 21 @newsis.com, who had not yet been hired, also eliminated three other applicants with unclear reputations, and three others were found to have applied for the post. Gangland decided to recruit 176 students in 2013, but was found to have asked Yeom Dong-yeol, a member of the Liberal Democratic Party's office of the ruling Grand National Party, to pass the examination by manipulating interview scores. In December of the same year, Kwon Sung-dong, a secretary of the ruling Grand National Party's office, asked for a job offer with a resume, and made a request to have a specific license even though the staff opposed it. Chuncheon District Public Prosecutors ' Office indicted Choi Heung-jib, former president of Gangwon Land, and a former chief of its planning and coordination office, for forcing him to hire Park. In addition, it was revealed that the Korea Western Development Agency appointed former chairman Lee as a candidate last October, and when Lee failed to make three nominations, it was eventually forced to swap the scores of applicants and assign them to the former head of the industry department. Some even deliberately eliminated women's land by manipulating scores. The Korea Coal Corporation gave high scores to male applicants and low scores to female applicants during the hiring process for an intern in July 2014, allowing only three out of 142 female applicants to have an interview. In interviews later, female applicants were given poor scores, so they were eliminated. The Korea Gas Safety Corporation also failed all seven female employees who were eligible to pass the exam by deliberately lowering their scores of atomic interviews with female sites in recruitment. The two main prosecutors, Wonju and Chungju Branch, handed over the former and present presidents of Korea Coal Corporation, the head of the Korea Planning and Development Headquarters, the former president of Korea Gas Safety Corporation and human resources department.▽ New South Korean election for the 6th National local elections was held simultaneously from 6 a.m. Tuesday. The scandal over hiring multiple gold products was also exposed. The former vice chairman of the ruling Grand National Party, Gangwon, was prosecuted for receiving 20 million won in return for being accepted by lawmakers after being offered a job at Kangwonderland, Gangwon Province, by an elementary school classmate. In addition, those who received 20 million won and 11 million won in compensation for recruiting students from Gangwon Land in 2014-2015 were also tried. After receiving 40 million won in compensation for hiring an assistant professor, Kang Kyung-mo, director of the Korea International University, and others were indicted at Jinju National University for excluding applicants who were placed first or second in class and passed applicants through additional recruitment procedures. Other corruption cases were discovered at the Korea Design Promotion Institute, Daegu University, Kyungbook Young Kwang School, and Woori Bank last year. We will continue to crack down on the appointment scandal in the private sector, which is not public or private, and we are conducting strict measures to deal with the corruption cases involving employees of Gangland Bank, and appoint new president of Korea Development Agency. akang@newsis.com[Donga Ilbo] [Security Test Center] [ADD] in Taean, South Chungcheong Province, recently discovered that a male friend who broke up with me at the front entrance of a dorm was found to have developed and tested high-tech weapons. On October 19, ADD confirmed that the female employee (contract worker) passed through the front door hiding her boyfriend, B, in her trunk of her car during the Chuseok holiday on October 5. B was reportedly not restrained until he left the main gate after spending time in A's dorm. ADD said she learned the story only after her girlfriend, B, broke up with her friend, revealed the fact to her surroundings. Anheung is a testing ground for the performance of major weapons such as ballistic missiles and naval vessels. June Moon Jae-in Black Tortoise president is here - has witnessed two ballistic missile tests. Some point out that the security of the nation's armed forces was lax enough to force the public into and out of important military facilities classified as ' Class '. The female employee reportedly submitted her resignation. An ADD official said, It appears that then the security guards at the gate neglected to search for the employee vehicles.

"Four people who died Thursday from a variety of infection routes to infection in a search for bacteria, including the testimony of their bereaved family members at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital and an intensive care unit, died. Parents of a newborn baby look at their baby's coffin in a motor car yesterday. Woo Sang-jo : The medical team is more likely to be responsible for bacterial contamination from three of the four newborns who died at Ewha Womans University's Mok-dong Hospital. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said yesterday that the sequence of gene bases for intestinal bacteria, known as "" citroprobe, "" was consistent. "" The fact that the gene sequences are the same for all three of us and that they are the same organism, and that they are the same organism, "" said the three children. "" It is impossible for three people to have the same bacteria on them without being transferred by humans, "" Hong said, adding, "" It is possible that a medical team had touched three children while they were contaminated. "" We can see evidence that Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital was either inadequate or inadequate in its infection control, Hong added. I believe there is a possibility of medical malpractice or infection, Jeong Eun-kyung, director of the KCDC, told the National Assembly's Health and Welfare Committee. In this regard, one family member told JTBC, After changing the diapers (medical team), we threw them down and picked it up with our hands. I put the pasturelle right into the baby's mouth. The bacteria of the problem do not die on the basis of the penicillin and the cephalin antibiotics available in the base of the vaginal canal. Though not super-bacterian resistant to vancomycin and methicilline, it is one of the most potent bacteria in the intestinal tract. Police investigating the case are also tracing the route of infection among newborns. The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's metropolitan investigation team searched Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital in cooperation with the police. They checked the intensive care unit on the 11th floor and the computer room where the infants died. Here, the investigators checked for device malfunction and seized various items that the infant might have contacted, including drug inputs and Ringers. The confiscated article contained medical records that the previous investigation failed to bring. The metropolitan team will send all possible media outlets of the infectious agents to the National Institute of Scientific Investigation. Police are paying attention to the fact that all four infants were being treated with intravenous feeding. Unlike other fluids such as glucose, TPN requires a doctor's manufacturing process in the middle. Doctors have to mix the right amount per patient, and it is possible that the doses were mistaken or contaminated in the process, said a researcher at the Samsung Economic Research Institute. Police also collected items related to TPN that were thrown into the trash. Police asked the head of the National Breather`s Breather`s Bureau of Food, who collected milk on the first day of the investigation. It is to check contamination due to poor management. The mothers said, "" At the recommendation of Professor Cho, who was the head of a neonatal intensive care unit, they used to freeze the breast milk before delivering it to the doctors. "" Professor Choi Byung-min of the Children's Division at Ansan Hospital said, We also encourage premature babies to breastfeed. But it is usually frozen and stored at home, as the breast milk could get damaged, explained Kim. Some of the bereaved families claimed, "" The medical team requested a consent from the clinical tests related to breast-feeding without sufficient explanation. "" One family member said, "" The medical team has three types of breast milk. "" Let's try out a trial with this. ' Four newborns were asked to leave the hospital from 6:30 a.m. to 1:20 p.m. A father who lost his nine-day-old daughter left for Incheon to go to a crematorium after the ceremony. Ms. Chung put her hand on a small coffin covered with white cloth. It was the last time she could say hello to her daughter who couldn't hold her hand properly. He kept saying, "" I'm sorry Dad. "" The Chungs named their daughter on the 18th, two days after she died. The mother went to her son who was taken to another hospital when his daughter turned into a handful of ash. The mother reported the birth of a twin boy who was hospitalized with her daughter."
"Kim Min-hee woke up with the sound of "" Katok! "" on the illustration at Daewoo minikim@chosun.com Before sunrise, it's five forty-five. It is a tok from an acquaintance in her 60s who exchanged business cards yesterday. A long story begins with the title of ' My Teacher is Near Me. ' The story of the prime minister in ancient China, Song Na Ra, is well explained. The short breathing sentence is divided into appropriate paragraphs, and the important part in the middle is a pick-shaped emoticon. It is a long text with two screens even though the contents are adjusted in small fonts. In the last paragraph, ' Today's Words ' is summarized once more. "" Talking is the domain of knowledge, and listening is the field of wisdom, "" said an office worker in her mid-thirties, "" who was immediately annoyed when he received it. "" "" I keep getting alerted when I am invited to an unwanted club, but it is such an invitation that I could not stop myself. Even the best words can not be read with good grace when they are received early in the morning. There are about five or six similar terrace rooms. Old people will stay awake because they haven't slept in the morning, but it is most of the time. The sender's intention would be to "" share, "" but when it comes to receiving the message, "" it feels like an attack. "" "" Jung used the term "" Jeong has a serious problem with having a short tongue. Whenever she receives unwanted articles, she feels violated and becomes enraged. He tried to escape but was unsuccessful. Some of the rooms could not be ' handed in ', so they were invited back to the party even when they left, giving up on the run. The word "" Katok hell "" and "" Katok Saw "" are now in the community. Katok Saw is a parody of Sou, a film based on a room that is almost impossible to escape. Tell me how to get out of the endless invitation : "" My Dantock is driving me crazy. "" "" My father-in-law and mother-in-law, Kartoke, I can't make it difficult to go crazy. ""There is a saying ' right to no connection ' : Katok hell, Katok prison, and Katok fetters. The original meaning is the right to receive no business-related contact outside of business hours. It is a concept that was created to protect the privacy of the workers and ensure their free time. France has begun guaranteeing by law its right to ' no connection ' since January 1 of this year, and Germany has issued cultural guidelines banning bosses from communicating to employees by telephone or e-mail after working hours. According to research by the Korea Labor and Social Research Institute, seven out of 10 Korean workers suffer from social networking services such as Kakak. In a 2015 survey of 2402 people, 70.3 percent of the respondents answered that they "" had worked outside of work hours or on their smartphones during the holidays. "" This was an issue even during the presidential election. Yoo Seung-min and if a party using workers in accordance with instructions, such as the sns and should see it from business hours, Moon Jae-in president also duty order after work.Announced pledges at that time, the limit. The right to be disconnected is not only needed in the workplace. The same is true of daily life. Exactly the right to be uninvited is needed : Unwanted. However, due to the nature of anti-force Katok, there is not much right to refuse invitations. In the past, MSN messenger had the right to "" block "" the person invited. When the other party invited them, they could choose to accept or block. If they didn't want it, they could just ' block ' it. Shielding was quite common in loose networks. Then they did not have to enter the room or group they invited, or listen to their voices. However, Kakao Talk, which is extremely open, is different. The locks on the rooms are loose like SNS, which is at the center of the "" Connected Society "". Invitators have more power than invitators. I was present when I was invited into the room. From then on, whether you want it or not, you should receive messages from individuals (at least one to hundreds) in the room. Even when I go out, I find myself in the room when someone invites me to the Dantock room, and against my will. Katok fetters are a good word. I can not resist reading. There is no ability to selectively turn off notification pop-ups from a single room. Once in Settings, select ' Alert pop-up ' and a pop-up will appear for every comment. The same is true of the frequently used Dantock room or the unattended Dantok room throughout the year. Of course, there are many net features of Katok, too. It is overwhelming in terms of convenience and efficiency. In cases of appointments, there is rarely a more effective place to say hello to a blind person when delivering an appointment. He feels good about greeting in the New Year with a funny image, and laughs at an emoticon with a stronger and stronger calendar. However, more and more people are complaining about the adverse effects of good air quality. At the center of the stress is the toxobank. Lee, who was in her early 40s, stopped social networking services due to the stress of being in a single toxobank. Lee called the room a ' time thief. ' It was the first time that 15 housewives learned about Dantokbang from the culture center. "" One of my mothers has put her daily life in a Dantock room almost real-time. From the story of the baby pick-up to the lunch menu and the dinner menu were taken and uploaded almost every day, and if the child was sick, the baby was also photographed with fecal matter. Whenever he went on an overseas trip, he would have covered it with pictures of tourist sites. I had doubts about why I was watching this. "" Maybe it would be a lot of inconvenience to me if I quit SNS. `` I felt uneasy about being isolated, but not that many, '' he said. It is the new world because we don`t do Katok. Communication with the telephone and text is essential. As I make many phone calls myself, I feel more friendly and less misleading. The time is also increased. I should say that I have become calm. I think there are less annoyance in our daily lives. "" There are many different kinds of short talk rooms and articles that can be uploaded by people who have not yet heard fake information. Other than touching and didactic writing, humor, video, health, and music are posted. Some of them are often seen as incorrect medical information. When actor Kim Joo-hyuk dies in a car accident, I wonder, ' What if you had a heart attack when you were alone?Words of the title ' have appeared everywhere. ' The article says "" Don't be frightened and cough strongly. "" With concrete tip to constantly repeat at intervals of 2 seconds to make and remove phlegm from the inside of the lungs. Sources appear quite reliable, following the Seoul Asan Hospital. It was a rumor. "" It was not provided by the hospital, "" said a Seoul Asan Hospital. It appears that the general public took the name of the hospital as a voluntary way. Regarding this information, experts advise that "" Don't miss an important time with a cough and ask for help around. "" Most of all, the cause of Kim Joo-hyuk's death was not a heart attack but damage to her head. There are many fake news. The writings on the effects of chili powder, ginger and burdock are all anticites. If you eat foods like blood circulation, anticancer effects, skin care, and constipation, you can easily get a cut in your blood. Much of the talk about the effects of mouthwash was also false. Experts say the history of oral cleansers and their short paragraphs have surprising effects in getting rid of athlete's foot, preventing dandruff, preventing pimples and itching. Some people swallowed this information blindly and poured oral cleansers into the wash for 30 minutes before they got pale water in their toenails. Health information is usually posted in a family room. Those in their 60s and older are most likely to be promoted. Behind the information comes a request from the elderly family. "" Honey, read this. I heard ginger is so good. Buy it while wrapping the ginger, and then put it to sleep with honey, eat you, and then feed the baby. I can not help answering such an article. It is impossible to tell whether one has read it or not, as the figures are nicely displayed. If you read the book (read it only and don't answer it), you can say one more word. "" My darling! You read that, right? "" And quite a bit of humor. The humor is most often based on conversations between elderly people, and sometimes dirty jokes are also included in a luxurious package. In many cases, the movie will run a hot rated video before it is deleted. Older people who like music share the story of the artist and the song with YouTube. Other information on the mobile phone plans is incorrect, and beautiful poems are introduced. After many articles, this is how they end. "" I'd appreciate it if you could send it to your friends as soon as you see it. "" As the generation of hardworking people living in their bodies, older people in their 60s and older, have an immediate reaction. As soon as they see it, they are immediately carried to the Dantock room. According to the Korea Press Foundation, 70 percent of Koreans could not get out of a single room even though they wanted to. In late October, the media promotion foundation conducted an online survey of more than 1000 men and women in their 20s and 50s on instant messaging awareness and behavior, and published the results in the third volume of media issues. It is also called the Korean Dantock Report. According to the survey, 64.7 percent of the respondents said they had been invited to a single room they did not want to participate in. Among them, 52.5 percent answered, ' If you are invited to a single room you don't want to participate in, you don't participate in conversations. ' Another 70.8 percent of the respondents said they wanted to get out of the Dantock room but could not. The biggest reason was ' fear of offending the other person or being offended (48.7 percent). ' The average Korean level of 5.7 Dantock rooms is that no one sees any single Dantock room as 100 % private space."
"- Written by Kim Hyeong-rik : "" Current expenses for Chosun, PG, and Redistribution is prohibited. "" (Total benefits of 1,467,700 won per person per month for wages. It is a 16.4 percent increase from this year's minimum hourly wage of 6,470 won, and the maximum increase in 17 years since September 2000 to August 2001 (a 16.6 percent increase). The Ministry of Employment and Labor said yesterday that single-person household workers who receive the minimum wage will receive a salary increase of 221,747 won per month, which is expected to help maintain their livelihood. Meanwhile, many small businesses and small businesses are worried about the potential harm to small businesses as they face a significant burden of labor. To ease the impact of wage hikes on minimum wage levels, the minimum wage commission is pushing to revamp the minimum wage range, including regular bonuses.The minimum wage information leaflet (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) announced on July 17, "" We will produce 150,000 copies of information about the minimum hourly wage for next year, and distribute them to local employment agencies, universities, and small and medium enterprises. "" 2017.12.17 [Yonhap News Agency] ◇ Workers ' benefits of 4.3million works… 233 out of 100 ' Benefits ' The estimated 23.6 % of workers will be affected by the bottom wage activity in the next year, and some 360,000 will be affected by the bottom wage. That means about 23 out of 100 workers will benefit from the minimum wage increase next year. Labor unions claim that the minimum wage of a single household worker (2.15 million won per month) should be 10,000 won to guarantee a minimum monthly income of 2.09 million won per month based on the 40-hour workweek. Workers of single-person households who receive the minimum wage for next year will receive 7.57 to 3,777 won on a salary basis of 290 hours. Labor unions are not likely to be satisfied with the minimum wage increase next year and are expected to focus on boosting the minimum wage increase by 2019.◇ Business circles are unavoidable for conservation-related management … In reality, about 50 percent of businesses with less than 300 employees "" sigh "" in middle-to-small businesses announced that they would like to tighten their belts next year before raising their minimum wage. According to the Korea Federation of Trade Unions, less than half of the ' 2018 CEO Economic Outlook ' survey of 273 member companies was conducted between the end of November and December, or less than 300 percent of them said they would also invest. 37.7 % of businesses concerned about the ' reduction in employment ' as a result of the minimum wage increase, while 24.6 % of businesses expect increased capital inputs (unmanned, automated, etc.) and 22 % rise in product prices. In a survey of 300 small and mid-sized companies on the economic status and policy opinions of small businesses, more than half said they need the most urgent policies, which include easing the burden of changes in labor policies, including minimum wage hikes. Small businesses in particular, such as PC rooms, convenience stores, supermarket, gas stations, business, restaurants, taxis, and expenses, should be subject to different business classes. Indeed, the industry, which has a high proportion of the minimum wage earners such as franchises, convenience stores, and gas stations, is seeking various ways to reduce labor costs, such as raising prices, reducing staff, and switching to unmanned stores.◇ Will the bonuses be included in the minimum wage? = The minimum wage committee will soon notify the Ministry of Employment and Labor of its plans to revamp the minimum wage range based on an agreement between employers and employees. Currently, only the minimum wage is paid regularly and uniformly once a month, such as basic, duty, and office benefits. Bonuses, extension, night and holiday work allowance are not included in the minimum wage. The business community is demanding a wider minimum wage increase. When non-administrative workers receiving an annual salary of more than 40 million won or more receive a basic salary, they receive a minimum wage increase, resulting in an increase in basic salary and bonuses. Labor unions, however, said the current low base wage rate is simply a "" code of tricks "" to reduce overtime, night and holiday pay based on ordinary wages, adding, "" If individual companies recap a complicated wage system.

"As if sales of Korean products by some small and medium independent travel agencies were suspended on March 5, large travel agencies "" No problem of Korean tourism "" … The first duty-free shop to be sold in January to February is also receiving an offer from China's first free agent, Yookkeo, Korea Newspart Union (Yonhap News). ▽ Beijing hama@yna.co.kr( = Shim Jae-hoon and Kim Jin-bang, the special correspondent of Yonhap News Agency (Beijing) = As China and China announced the hot weather at the end of October, Chinese and Chinese authorities have announced signs of selling the high and low altitude missiles as a missile defense system (THAAD·Sad) Large Chinese travel agencies in China are selling their products starting next January to February, and as a result, a large Chinese organization that does not allow tourists to travel to Beijing and Shandong has a similar trend. According to the related industries on July 20, the head of the National Tourism Organization of China's tourism department allowed group tours to Korea in Beijing and Shandong Province at the end of last month, but the Korean tourist agency was denied a visa waiver on July 22. An official at a Chinese travel agency in Beijing said, The authorities have banned Hitao Travel Agency from traveling to Korea by the end of the year and selling Korean products. Hitao Travel Agency took 32 Chinese tourists out of China on July 2 for the first time since it was allowed on March 28 to suspend group tours to Korea. Another official in the industry also said, There was one case in which a Chinese travel agency on its way to Korea was refused a group visa. "" There was a recent wild expansion of Korean language among Chinese travel agencies, and it was estimated that some regions would have been subjected to deterrence, "" he said in Beijing with China's permission to say. However, unlike small-and-middle-sized travel agencies in China, large travel agencies will begin releasing Korean travel packages in January next year as planned, and sales are currently perfectly intact, he said. China's state-run China Youth Travel Agency (CYTS) recently launched and began selling various products related to Korea, including free tours to Seoul, Busan, and Jeju, in January and February. Officials have not received any notice to stop the group visa again, said an official at a Chinese travel agency, Korea`s largest group traveling product currently being sold in January and February. Another official who declined to be named also commented on the condition, "" I don't think some small and medium sized Chinese travel agencies are as a warning to them, so I don't see how large travel agencies are currently preparing to sell Korean products.

"CBS News Show for Kim Hyun-jung - who calls for a minimum wage and calls for a day's report on a thief - "" If no other participles had ... "" - Disappointed? Of course, the owner of the restaurant reported that he had used 50 plastic bags in the first place, and it turned out that it was not the case. But behind this extraordinary theft report, there was a conflict between a part-timer and a convenience store owner. When you have a conflict between a part-timer and the owner, something really unexpected happens. What do you think it is? Today, I will take a look at the sorrow of particulars. First of all, the arbitresian who used two plastic bags and was declared guilty of theft. Let's meet first. Connect anonymously. Hello. Hello, part-timer ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Excuse me, how old are you? I am now 20 years old. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung, How long have you worked at a convenience store? I have been working for two months now. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > First of all, check. Did you use 50 plastic bags? Is it Chapter 2? Which one is right? I want to see page 2 Are you chapter 2 or Kim Hyeon-jung? Then, since you reported it, the police would have investigated, and the police concluded that it was Chapter 2, not guilty? One of my part-time students > I checked two of them right. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > So, since it is Chapter 2, did you end up not sending the case to the prosecution? ◆ Payback Student > Yes. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > How much is it per sheet? I want to get 20 won. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > 20 won, so you wrote down 40 won? ◆ Payback Student > Yes. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Although you wrote 50 pages, it is 1000 won, right? ◆ Payback Student > Yes. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Ah…When did the police report that you had used 50 plastic bags and called? (Photo : Data photo) ◆ Partner > December 10. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : What kind of situation did you hear from? I was sleeping in the morning when I called my cell phone number. He was reported to have been charged with stealing. So I prepared to go out with him, and he is near my house. Are there any police officers in the museum? So we went to the police station together by car. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung, how did you feel? I didn't believe it at first. When you told me it was theft, I was very scared and I did. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > scary. Right. Isn't this your first time in a police car? ◆ Payback Student > Yes. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > I heard that you had some conflict over how this happened. I asked to go to work for at least 3 months at first, but after I went there for about 2 months, I could not go out because of the situation. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > stopped. When I told you about the middle part time student, however, I asked him to show up until this month to save some people, but he suddenly said that he would give me a wage later on the day that I was going to get my next job. I usually pay on the last day. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > So, what was the original payment? I should have received it 20 days or so When I asked him if I could get it to him sooner, he said, "" I can't afford an advance or anything. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > No. There was a conflict there. Again? Other than that, I was in a bit of a conflict about the work contract. Actually, I said I would know because you told me that it was 5800 won per hour when you first entered. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : Originally, the hourly wage is 6470 won per hour, but she said it is 5800 won. Then, about 90 %? That's right. But the contract for the worker was signed for more than a year. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > So, in case we are being interviewed now, we do not work for one year, but it is recognized that it is only during probation when it is more than one year? ◆ Payback Student > Yes. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > So the contract itself is not applicable to anyone who works short hours? And you asked for more? Do you want it for 6470 won?I told you so. But when you said you were out of the deposit, the conversation ended, and the next day, you were called in. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > You have two conflicts. On the amount of wages and the time of payment I say this is so strong on both sides, and even if there is something that we can discuss legally, what are we paying attention to? Tell the police, if this is the only conflict that's happening, report it to the police. ◆ Payback Student > Yes. When the shop owners tell their partainers to eat waste only with words, and ask them to leave without recording a call or text message, sue them for embezzlement. What is waste, Kim Hyun-jung? ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung has a expiration date. Some people give it to pailers now after the date. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I will throw it away anyway, so I won't hurt it, so give it to me while I eat. Just tell the side job student without leaving a record. Do that and keep the CCTVs as they store things that padule students eat. Then, when they ask for their retirement, they ask for it as if it is embezzlement or something. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung ; Where did you hear this? This is what most of the particles know. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Such things happen. As for convenience stores, they are usually not the lowest, even the owners of convenience stores are not doing business these days. Even so, it wouldn't be possible if I didn't give my part-timer who is more than that to me what I was supposed to pay him. Isn't that something else? If you add the extra features, it would make you feel sad. Didn't you cry after you were called in and questioned by the police? I cried a lot. Did you cry a lot? It is very hard. I don't want any of my other particulars to go through this. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I don't know if this is comforting, but this is another lesson learned in life, growing pains. Thank you for part-timer. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Thank you. Now, these are the tip of the iceberg. The Arviets say the suffering is great. Let's connect with Lee Nam-jun, a labor union worker at the Center for Youth Workers. Good morning, Mr. Lee. Hello Lee Nam Jun > I am Nam Jun Lee of the Center for Youth Labor's Rights. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > The story of a part-timer working for plastic bags is incredible, and why do you report theft when you have conflicts like this? Is it true? There is a community among the shop owners, the Internet. That spread among the presidents. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : Like the know-how? ♫ Lee Nam-jun > Yes. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Of course, many shop owners treat their own part-time employees who are good at doing things. But these cases definitely exist now in reality, and they're being received, and that's what they say. ^ Lee Nam-jun > Yes. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. We've heard of convenience stores, but they actually have a lot of work to do outside of them. What cases have you received so far? Lee Nam-jun : The students who work for me tend to be unable to assert their rights. No matter what the boss says, they're often just being attacked. For example, when a sexual harassment incident can have a huge impact, a married male owner has to do with a part-timer. Will you kiss me when you wash the dishes? Like this. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > wait. What do you mean? Will you kiss me when you wash the dishes? What do you mean? If you do the dishes when you are with a part-timer and the boss, can you kiss me or go out with me? Sometimes it happens to your friends this way. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > This is not what the laborers thought, but what stories did you actually receive? Mr Lee : Yes. We're talking about that in our actual consultation. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > If you wash the restaurant and you have to wash the dishes, would you do this and that? Mr Lee : Yes. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung ; What other cases did you hear? In case of Lee Nam-jun > side job students, there are not many cases where the period of contract is not set, and there are not many part-time workers who can work in place. For example, when you say you are sick because of an hour of work, don't just show up to the part-timer, take a rest, and relax for life. And if you don't like it, you can get rid of it, and it happens a lot. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Such an easy dismissal, however, is still taking place on the ground of everyone who gets laid off. ^ Lee Nam Joon > Many of the small business sites, convenience stores, etc., are happening to the small business students. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Most of the people who work part-time are customers. I think the quality and stress you get from your customers will be terrible. Lee Nam-jun (> ◆ alba jun deul saeng . teuki, especially for part-time workers at the mart), is used to restrain the customers ' behavior or restrict certain actions. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Security management, parking management, and cart removal. Students who work at these jobs do a lot. Lee Nam-jun : There were occasions when customers easily took such part-time jobs. When the customers bring these things,"
"Who are you to say no? At most times Linda is waking up. ◇ Is there any specific case that you remember about Kim Hyun-jung >? Lee Nam Jun > This is a female high school student who works at a pool hall and does part time job after the college entrance exam. I first served a drink, and I think there was something called the yulmuca on the menu. I asked him if he would like some tea, and he asked me to replace his body parts with a nipple ring, and he made sexual harassment comments like this. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > This is such a provocative, burning harassment that I can't even put on the air right now that my face is turned on, that I have to listen to my part-timer's comments often and see them from the host. Mr Lee : Yes. We have to work harder because we listen to customers. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > What happens if I protest there? When they protest about why ^ Lee Nam-jun > has the right to say so, but in such cases, be patient because the boss loses a customer at the store. And there are many occasions when it's more difficult to do this. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > If you protest and get angry one more time, can you get fired? Mr Lee : Yes. Why does the boss work like that? Sometimes you get in the way of your business, and sometimes you fire your friends like this. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Okay. I'm really going to stay up all night talking like this. We're wearing a hat for about an hour now, and now we've got to find an alternative. Why don't they stop when I haven't heard about the Alvas ' suffering in a day or two? Why not get rooted out? Even if the bosses don't follow such laws, we'll be all right. Or the punishment is weak. Because of this awareness, it would be important to strengthen the supervision of workers who can be managed and overseen in the short term.In the mid - to long-term, our perceptions need to change, but I think we can form a relationship between the president and his or her part-timer while respecting each other. So, now I believe that a good boss and working relationship can be formed in the long run if labor human rights training is conducted frequently. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. There are quite a few bosses who treat Arviets as if they were their family, employers like that. We don't have to criticize those people, but I hope that those pre-modern bosses who still exist, they can do it on this occasion. I hope the alternatives you have mentioned will work. Let's hear today. Thank you. Thank you. I was Lee Nam-jun, a labor manager at the Center for Youth Workers ' Rights. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Lee Nam-jun was a hard worker.

Starting this year, all businesses are required to retire at the age of 60, but six out of 10 seniors still lose their jobs around the age of 50. The Ministry of Employment and Labor held a deliberation committee on employment policies presided over by Minister Kim Young-ju at the Korea Press Center in Sejongdae-dae, Seoul, on July 20, and voted on the "" Third Youth Promotion Plan for the Employment of Elderly People. "" Article 19 of the Employment Promotion Law for the Elderly, revised in 2013, requires companies to set the retirement age at all sites to be 60 or older starting this year. However, the unfair retirement and early retirement practices still remain, leaving the retirement age of 60 as a nominal requirement.In addition, the proportion of people aged 55 and older will soar from 26.1 percent in 2015 to 31.3 percent in 2020 and 40.4 percent in 2030. As a result, the government has come up with a policy of hiring men aged 55 and over who are active in the age of work.The ministry will first revise the law to allow the retirement age system at the age of 60. Section 12 of the Employment Promotion Law for the Elderly requires companies with more than 300 to commit to hiring 2 % to 6 % of workers over the age of 50 years. It removes this provision and enables all businesses to retire under 60.In particular, the Act also provided that any vacancies in 47 public or 80 private jobs should be allocated first for those aged 50 or older. The number of jobs that can be cut to 40, regardless of the public and private sectors, and those that can afford to be employed are expected to grow. To that end, 320 public institutions will be investigated early next year.The government will finish an investigation into the retirement age, actual retirement age, and retirement reason of major companies before revising the law. In addition, it provides businesses with expert advice on reshuffling the wage structure, such as introducing job appraisals, to finish retirement age from key jobs.They can work until they are 65 years old before receiving a national pension after retiring at the age of 60.

"Minister of Commerce, Industry and Energy Minister Baek Woon-kyu greets at the renewable energy policy council held at the Seoul Energy Dream Center Monday. 2017.12.20 % of renewable energy generation at jjaeck9@yna.co.kr increased by 200-20 % … investment in private and rural solar and solar appliances ; and budget by 110 trillion won ... "" (Gigawatt, a reporter at Yonhap news agency) increased by 11 trillion won. Considering that the capacity of the latest nuclear plant, the APR 1400, is 1.4 GW-the construction of nearly 35 new plants, such as solar and wind. The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy held its second renewable energy policy council in Seoul on July 20 and announced its plan to implement renewable energy 3020. The plan aims to increase the share of renewable energy to 20 percent by 2030, which is 7 percent of total electricity generation by 2016. The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy has determined that a total of 63.8 GW`s renewable energy facilities are needed by 2030. Existing facilities should add 48.7 GWs of new equipment by 2030. New installations have the largest solar energy share with 63 percent and wind power at 34 percent. Wind power is intended primarily to be built at sea, taking environmental issues into consideration. [Graphic] By 2030, the size of new facility for solar and wind construction is nearly half of the maximum electricity demand of 100.5 GW-the industry's forecast for 2030. The reason why so many facilities are needed is to compensate for the intermittency of renewable energy with large variations in electricity production depending on the environment, such as cloudy or windless weather. The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy achieved 28.8 GWs out of its new facilities through large-scale projects of power generation companies, and the rest are small businesses (7.5 GWs) that will fill up the facilities of private companies and solar farms (7.5 GWs). Larger projects will be carried out as a first step, with a size of 5 GWs in 2018 and 2022. According to a survey of private and public enterprises on their willingness to participate in the project, 21.3 GWs are also possible, but the investment plan is to be made first, which is the most reliable. The remaining 23.8 GWs are expected to gradually increase the ratio of renewable energy supply obligations by encouraging large electricity producers to fill a certain amount of renewable energy sources each year. For large-scale projects, local governments will designate the land they have found as a renewable energy generating zone and supply it to businesses.It is also a measure to revise the farm law, install solar energy in salt mines and agricultural reservoirs, and utilize idle national property regulations such as the rooftop of military structures. As part of its policy to encourage the citizen-participation business, the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPC) will purchase the remaining electric power if households can not use up their electricity generated by solar cars. Currently, only the remaining power can be carried forward. It also plans to expand the mandatory certification of zero-energy buildings to all buildings by 2030. It is planning to upgrade the Korean form of the power generation gap support system for solar power generating companies and make it mandatory for six state-run power companies to purchase electric power generated by small solar energy producers such as cooperatives or farmers. The existing FIT has made up the difference with its power industry-based fund, which is made up of 3.7 percent of consumer electricity bills, but has been suspended due to financial burden. The Korea Electric Power Fund (FIT), which is pushing forward, decided to reflect the difference in the cost of electricity instead of preserving it, but the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy explained that it would not be too much of a burden to limit the size of participating businesses. The government estimated that a total of 110 trillion won would be needed to implement the 3020 renewable energy program.Minister of Commerce, Industry and Energy Choi Jae-gu attended a renewable energy policy council meeting held at the Seoul Energy Dream Center on July 20. The government budget for jjaeck9@yna.co.kr is 18 trillion won, which includes loans from small power operators and the project to supply solar power to private companies, while the remaining 92 trillion won is for new facility investment by state-owned enterprises (51 trillion won) and private (41 trillion won). The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy announced yesterday that it has reflected the new facility investment costs in the 8th basic electricity supply plan that it reported to the National Assembly. At the time, the ministry insisted, There will be almost no increase in electricity rates by 2022 when it comes to energy conversion. The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy estimated that even considering investment costs in new and recycled facilities, electricity charges would rise 1.3 percent from this year, and rates would rise 10.9 percent from this year in 2030. The ministry has prepared an amendment to the 4th Framework Plan for Renewable Energy Systems based on the implementation plan and is scheduled to finalize it early next year at the New Renewable Energy Policy Council.

Foreign workers were most satisfied with their work, with a slightly higher satisfaction rate of 39.5 percent, followed by regular workers with a higher satisfaction rate of 32.7 percent, a higher satisfaction rate of 21.4 percent, slightly dissatisfied 5.8 percent, and very unsatisfactory. In the survey, immigrants were found to have lived in Korea for more than 91 days, including both foreigners and naturalized Korean nationals. Among foreigners, illegal immigrants were excluded from the statistics because they could not be investigated."
"▽ Work remaining in dock = When most of the small shipyard is to be launched at 4 a.m. and revived, it is almost entirely due to the completion of the project. Hong Seong-tae, chairman of the Korean Trade Unions ' labor union, and his union officials climbed the 17-meter lighting tower. This year, they demanded a 3.8 percent raise in wages, but when the company refused, they went on a hunger strike. Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. has received nearly 10 trillion won in tax money since 2015 due to poor accounting practices and poor management. The union agreed to give up 10 percent of its payroll in April when it received extra financial aid, but is now on strike and protest against the move.Dock Sea Dog Center in Tongyeong, Gyeongnam Province is empty. After handing over the last completed vessel to the owners of the vessel in early November, the shipyard was completed by the time when there were no more ships to build. Out of the 1,200 workers, some 800 others, excluding those needed to maintain and manage the shipyard, went on leave. "" Small shipyard and shipbuilding machinery and equipment makers have already been prohibited, and now the major shipbuilders are on the road and will gradually move to larger ones, "" a shipbuilding official said.◇ Korea imported ship orders this year, but ... Korea's shipbuilding ranked first in the world with an average of half of the average. This year, after last year's cut in manpower, closure of some poisons, and asset sales, however, the `` order cliffs '' last year were affecting sales by one and a half months to two years.A shipbuilding firm in Geoje, South Gyeongsang Province has empty factories due to a lack of work. Kim Jong-ho, a reporter at the Korea Media Center, is threatening to survive in the North's middle-sized and large-sized shipbuilding companies as the situation gets worse next year. The global shipbuilding business is showing little signs of recovery after a 10-year recession, with hopes hanging over it.Until November of this year, orders for ships in the world were estimated at 500,000 CGT (the number of tons converted into standard freighter aircraft due to the difficulty of construction of the vessel). It is up 67 percent from last year.But that is due to the ' basal effect ' last year, which was the worst. It is half of the annual average ship's shipping capacity (42.62 million CGT) 2010 and 2015. Korea Shipbuilding received orders for 152 ships this year and $ 142 billion (5.4 trillion won). The amount is three times larger than last year, but still 40 % of the 2010 - 2015 average order ($ 35.9 billion). As orders for ships are sluggish, the remaining work (remaining volume of orders) is drying up. In November, the remaining orders of our shipbuilders were halved to 356 units and 1.79 million CGT ships, compared with late 2015.◇ Big three sales dropswith … The survival gap at the shipyard next year = sluggish orders for ships in 2016 is expected to lead to sluggish sales next year as well as in the second half of this year. Chosun is not captured as a revenue when winning orders for ships worth hundreds of billions of won or trillions of won, but rather as a revenue structure based on the ship's construction progress rate. Because of delays of approximately two years between winning orders for ships and the actual construction process and actual construction, the year 2016 `` order cliffs '' will lead to falling sales in the second half of the year and next year.The brokerage forecast that sales of Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. will fall 11 percent and 31 percent next year, respectively, from this year. Samsung Heavy Industries and Construction forecast to lose 240 billion won next year, following a deficit of nearly 500 billion won this year.The three large shipbuilders have begun to reduce their size this year by shutting down their poisons and reducing their workforce. Hyundai Heavy has carried out more than 3.5 trillion won of its own plans so far, including the sale of its subsidiary, High-Investment Securities Co., and the restructuring of its workforce. Starting last September, the company started taking time off from work and training. Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering is also in the process of restructuring, including the sale of its headquarters and the reduction of its workforce, and announced a capital increase worth 80 billion won to improve its financial structure.Even if the three larger companies are able to survive, midsize shipbuilders such as Seongdong Shipbuilding Ocean Co. under a voluntary agreement with creditors and STX Shipbuilding Ocean Co. that graduated from court receivership in July can remain opaque next year. The government plans to decide whether to oust or revive the two companies next February by examining their industrial competitiveness.The number of Korean shipbuilders fell 23.3 percent in November. The figure decreased by 42,200 from last year to around 20 percent for the eighth straight month.◇ The end of the 10-year global shipbuilding recession next year = The outlook for the shipbuilding industry next year is not very bright. At least he is relieved to see that he is recovering from last year`s worst and this year. We are at the end of a decade-long slump cycle, said Choi Kwang-sik, a research fellow at Korea Investment and Securities Co. As international oil prices are rising, it is expected that the sea plant sector will recover. Foreign news sources say the order of the FPS (Floating Production System) in 2017 was the largest amount of money recovered since 2014, and an investment of $ 940 billion is expected over the next five years.Even though we expect demand to grow on the shipbuilding industry, which experienced restructuring and a cliff in the overall downturn of the industry, to grow at a slower rate than previous orders, said Hyundai Economic Research Institute.▽ Comprications : ilbo Chosun Ilbo & Chosun.com, no unauthorized reproduction and redistribution.

"Galaxy S8 Series Banners at Gangnam Station in Seoul April 20. ' Classic ' Samsung's Return to the World ' by ' Samsung's Smart Phone Business ' … China's ' Samsung's Return to the World ' (April 20, 2005) Samsung Electronics Co., which was suspended last fall by the Galaxy Note 7 shooting, recaptured its top spot in the global smartphone market by launching Galaxy S8 and Fall Galaxy Note 8. Apple is making huge profits after receiving enthusiastic reviews from the Mania family for its iPhone X, the 10th anniversary model of the iPhone, with its 3-dimensional face ID. LG Electronics, on the other hand, released the 300 series in the spring and the gaeul0 series in the fall, but was pushed out of the global smartphone rankings. Chinese smartphone makers, including Huawei, are also showing outstanding responses. With its outstanding price competitiveness and advanced technology, Samsung and Apple fiercely followed in the global market and expanded its presence here.Samsung Electronics ` Galaxy S8’Bigsby drive screen [filmed Hajihun] ◇ Samsung's flashy comeback results … "" I overcame the shock of the gaelork 7 explosion "" The company announced last fall when it launched the Galaxy Note 7 explosion Samsung Electronics concluded that the battery in Galaxy Note 7 was defective and conducted a safety measure such as strengthening the battery safety check. Released about a month later in late March at a separate event, the Galaxy S8 immediately after its release in late April caused a sensation of success and restored consumer confidence. The number of pre-release orders for the Galaxy S8 in Korea reached 1 million in 11 days, 2.5 times larger than that of Galaxy Note 7. In less than a month, 5 million units were sold around the world, 15 percent more units were sold than the original Galaxy S 7 and more than 20 million units were shipped. Galaxy Note 8 released in September sold 850,000 units in Korea and sold more than 1 million units in 48 days in early November. Samsung Electronics introduced Bigsby, an intelligent voice secretary that can be called by pressing a button on the Galaxy S8. Instead of the old S Boys, who had a hard time dealing with Apple's Siry and Google's Google Assistant, they launched a full voice service. However, this year's market share (estimated by Strategy Analytics) of the voice secretary sector is 12.7 %, followed by Google Assistant (45.9 %) and Apple Siri (41.1 %) with no improvement in performance. Samsung has adopted an Infiniti display that minimizes bezel (border) from the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8, and this design feature is expected to remain on the Galaxy S9 next year. Samsung Electronics also posted its quarterly global market share (shipments based on stratification), which was the first decline in five years in the fourth quarter of last year, up from the previous quarter. This is because the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8 have a consistent line-up of medium - and medium-sized products. According to the Strategy Analytics, a market research firm, Samsung Electronics is expected to ship 318.8 million smartphones worldwide this year and has a 20.5 percent share."" KT iPhone X-Market Event "" is being reviewed by employees at the "" KT iPhone X-Market "" event held at KT Square in Gwanghwamun, Seoul on November 24, 2017. pdj6635@yna.co.kr Apple unveiled three iPhone 8, 8 +, and X in its September release event this year, as opposed to several years of introducing two new phones each fall - the conversation section and the digestive page. Among them, iPhones 8 and gwaplus, which are 4.7 inches in size and 5.5 inches respectively, were a minor upgrade to the iPhone 7 and 7 platform from a year earlier, but iPhone X was the first to be released by Apple on its 10th anniversary. The iPhone X dropped the fingerprint identification system, which was included with the iPhone 50s in 2013 to the iPhone 8 in 2017, and instead inserted the face recognition system, the face ID, which utilizes a three-dimensional scan. The camera uses infrared rays to display about 30,000 dots and read and analyze them using the iPhone's seven million-pixel smart depth camera. In addition, the first OLEDs screen, not LCD, was installed in the iPhone series. The price of 64GB model and 252GB model were also $ 999 and $ 1,149, which is about $ 200 higher than the previous highest iPhone. In Korea, the price of the land where the owner pays the taxes was 1,367,700 won and 1,557,600 won. The iPhone X went on sale in early November, more than a month later than the two ' regular models, ' the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. However, the price was very high and initial supply of products was not smooth due to the problem of parts yield until early December. Accurate sales have not yet been released, but recent analysis by U.S. investment bank Cowen and Company revealed that the combined sales forecast for all iPhone models in the fourth quarter of this year is a modest increase from last year's 70 million. Apple's forecast for the fourth fiscal quarter of this year's iPhone sales was $ 84 billion to $ 87 billion when it announced its earnings. According to the SA forecast, Apple's iPhone shipments this year are estimated to reach 218.1 million units and its global smartphone market share is estimated to be 14.0 percent.Choi Jae-gu, LG Electronics 300 (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) : Each mobile phone company released LG Electronics ' 300 smartphone on September 21, 2017, and a citizen passes by the 300 advertisement in front of a cell phone store in Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul. LG Electronics ` smartphone business, which is mired in a slump, recorded a net loss for the 10th consecutive quarter from the second quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of this year. This year, he launched premium smartphones such as the 60 and V0 in the spring, and the product's performance was praised, but he has not regained his market share. LG Electronics has had a 3 percent global smartphone market share since 2015, according to SA estimates. The third quarter of this year was ranked 7th. LG has already failed to make a hit in the premium market with a solid system between Apple and Samsung, while the Chinese market is suffering from a protracted slump in securing competitiveness among Chinese makers in the mid-price phones.

"- Virtual coin market volatility Rising Home and Foreign. - Coinses are staggering, too. - "" Yubbit bankruptcy is likely to break down, and virtual currency volatility is on the rise. "" [Herald Economy = Yunho's journalist] As Bitchin was on the defensive over the poor performance of the Chicago Board of Trade and regulations the previous day, it looked as if the currency had soared by Quantum and this kind of currency, but the spread of the U-Bet bankruptcy spread among China's three major banks. According to the Bitcone Rate Index on the morning of July 20, the Bitcond Rate dropped by 2 %, while Bitcond Cache and Quantum are soaring by 30 %. However, the situation was different for the Koinwon, another virtual currency exchange.While the fluctuations of the Bitcone and Bitcone Cache are similar to that of rain, Quantum has shown a decline of nearly 3 percent. Bitcone is down by 7 percent, while Bitcone Cache and Quantum are up by 30 percent, according to coin markcaps that put virtual bills at the dollar.First of all, the decline in bit coins, which at least have a unified direction, appears to have been caused by the global squeeze on bit coins. The day before that, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Mer said, "" I will suggest that the leaders of the 20 major countries discuss the question of Bitcone together at the G20 summit in Argentina next April. "" In a survey of 53 major U.S. economists, 96 percent of the respondents said Bitcone was a bubble.To make matters worse, Bitcone's debut on the Chicago Board of Trade was also sluggish. Bitcone futures are down 8.06 percent at $ 12,7560 per contract at the Chicago Board of Trade. It is also likely that the stock market will weaken as well as the bit coins due to other negative effects in Korea. It is the bankruptcy of the virtual currency exchange, Yoobit. Yoobit announced on July 19 that it would go bankrupt after hacking into the country stole 17 percent of its assets. The weakness of hacking on the virtual currency exchange has once again become apparent. Zobbit reported in a police investigation that about 1.7 billion won of virtual currency was stolen. "" We will first pay 75 percent of our customers ' outstanding balance to be elected, and we will pay the rest of their unpaid portion when they are finished with the final payment, "" Yoobit said. If customers want to be compensated in addition to their company's payments, they should seek civil damages.The virtual currency market is in a tailspin due to two such incidents. On the afternoon of July 19, during the day of the exchange, the rate of exchange of credit increases as if it were 20 to 50 percent, and the effect of the decline of the dollar was reflected in the morning. Experts say investors ' panic is likely to soar due to the security issues at the virtual currency exchange as well as the Bit-coins.Industry watchers say the volatility of the local Bitcond Capital, which has declined since the regulation and CME futures deals, has not been shown to be greater than the volatility of the local currency market, but rather the volatility of the financial markets themselves has been explained by the message that it will not necessarily mean the reliability of the virtual currency investors. youknow@heraldcorp.comForeign news agencies yesterday (Tuesday) reported on two trees with iron spikes packed in branches, as of local time.The tree in question is in a small town in Bristol, England.One resident who requested anonymity said the iron nails were installed to stop bird droppings from falling into their luxury cars.For some reason, although there were many other trees, birds would flock to these two trees, often causing cars to get messy.Another resident explained, "" The fake owl was set up and scared the birds, but it didn't work at all. ""Local residents usually use iron nails installed on shelves under windows or outside of buildings to keep birds from sitting or building new homes.Very rarely has it been installed in the same space that birds originally live.When that became known, British netizens began to criticize the bird for having been wrong, saying, "" Does it make any sense for a bird to sit on a tree? "" and "" It is selfish indeed. ""Local British Green Party Congressman Paula Oruark, "" It's literally just that birds can't live here, "" and she was devastated."" We often miss out on how precious the existence of wild animals living with us in trees, green spaces, and cities, "" he said, "" and Congress will soon consider this issue.

"Although the labor-deprived country has become a world where job seekers are treated, it is a matter for contract workers, especially older workers.Medium-year-old workers are the main reasons for layoffs.Japanese media reported on July 20 that before the dispatch of workers and the implementation of the Labor Law in September 2018, employers in their 40s and 50s are forced to fire.A 58-year-old man who spent 17 years working under a 3-month contract was informed by a dispatched company to suspend his employment at the end of this month.After decades of discrimination, including decades of lower wages than regular work, the patient's face was filled with tears at the shocking notice of dismissal.At the notice of his dismissal, Mr. A wept. He worked alone with his children. He complained that he had only worked hard for the two children. (Photo : Ray Burnett's Capture) Because the abrupt dismissal of temporary workers would result in the shift of the labor law into contract after working for three years without any extra procedures. Businesses are required to hire workers when they want to and can not refuse them.As a result, dispatched companies and companies are busy thinning out the middle-aged workers like Mr. A for saving money. The situation is not only the case with Mr. A, but with the five colleagues who worked together.These contract and police officers who lose their jobs overnight are once again frustrated by the age cliff.Companies face significant costs in hiring full-time employees based on their experience and seniority, and based on their connections with young employees within the workplace and how long they can work, for example, on recruitment opportunities or on the job description.As a result, they are not able to get reemployed and are busy sending out workers with other agencies, so they are forced to work part-time or day jobs.The dismissal of about 14,000 non-regular workers by the Japan Post Office has aroused controversy, as the phrase "" Using and dumping non-regular workers is inexcusable. "" Though it is not for today's use of temporary workers, they are raising their heads again before enforcing the law next year. (Photo : Court Decision in Tokyo) Meanwhile, businesses are in trouble, too.They are too short of hands to be released, and they are not employed for important positions, but they can not be collected or distributed when needed. They also say that it is too much to handle, such as having to think about the proper arrangement for them every time, and that they need to raise wages.Labor lawyer Umeda Katsutaka said, "" The law aims to improve the treatment of contract and dispatched workers and stabilize employment, but it is vital that some of these workers are dismissed before the rights are incurred. ""According to a Labor Policy Institute survey released in May, 9600 employers with more than 10 employees plan to hire non-regular workers and 60 percent of them are employed. Even so, they differ in many ways, including regular workers, salaries and welfare, as they are contract weapons, not regular workers.It is said that the layoffs of irregular workers start with small businesses and gradually increase the layoffs of big businesses and universities. The Japanese government had predicted that hiring businesses would be carried out because of the shortage of human resources, but it is starting to fire the middle-aged people who were concerned.At the center of layoffs, they need to raise their voices to guarantee workers ` rights, lawyer Umeda said.Losing a workable age job can cause a huge setback in old age preparation. A last time she went to work, she heard a last greeting, "" Return me your access card.

"Japan's legal authorities carried out a "" death penalty "" against criminals 20 years after the law enforcement was enforced. In Japan, a country represented by NHK's screen-capturing United States, strict enforcement of laws against juvenile crimes is being encouraged. As the death penalty is enforced suddenly on July 19, it is likely that the discussion on lowering the age of the juvenile law from the current age of under 20 to 18 is underway. Civic groups calling for the abolition of the death penalty have resisted, saying, The execution of capital punishment for cases committed at a mentally immature age is against the international trend. The Japanese Justice Ministry announced on July 20 that it had executed two death row inmates who committed robbery and murder at a Tokyo jail on the day before. Seki Teruhiko (69, the first female member of the royal family to die in China-do, Chiba Prefecture, in 1992), and Annaka (the first female family member of Daejongnyeong-dong, Matsui) in 1994 The death penalty has been carried out only five months since July, and it is the 21st time since the second Abe cabinet was launched in 2012. There are 122 inmates who are currently in jail.Teruhiko Seki, 19, is the first criminal justice to be executed since 1997. `` We have committed extremely brutal acts that take noble lives for selfish reasons, '' Yokowa Kamikawa told reporters at a news conference, `` We have carefully examined it before we are executed.
