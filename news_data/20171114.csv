Lee Kook-jong, who conducted the operation on the soldier, told reporters on July 14, We will continue to pass through the crisis for the next 10 days, saying, The damaged organ has been seriously contaminated and therefore forced to suture. "" That's why I can`t recover, "" he said, saying, "" because my organs were severely contaminated with feces and I operated on a shock from bleeding deeply. "" Professor Lee explained, "" It is not the time to say that this does not affect the patient's life. "" The soldier who received five hours of surgery on the day before reportedly had good condition and could not die. A second or third operation is needed, but no surgery is scheduled on that day, Professor Lee said.

The judge, who is a teacher, is guilty of two counts of indecent assault on a victim who is in the sixth grade at the age of 12, and of committing adultery in the sixth trial, the judge said in a statement. It is all the more shocking to see that the first place the accused committed adultery with the victim was in the first grade classroom, said the defendant in liaison with the victim, meeting with him and malingering the criminal. The accused insists the victim was mature and adorable, but the accused should recognize that sexual intercourse with elementary school students under the age of 13 is the same as rape. The court especially said, "" Teachers who believe in young elementary school students are just perfect indictors, of course, and believe in the correct and correct role of teachers in sexual harassment. "" Students also repeatedly believe that what teachers ask is correct and correct in their role. The court said, "" The accused's crime was not only a personal offense against children and their parents, but also a serious offense against sound morals and integrity that had long been firmly established in our society. ""A was charged with having had sex several times in elementary school with boys, classrooms and cars he attended from May to August.

On July 14, the Seoul High Court Criminal Department 3 (Cho Young-chul) sentenced Choi to three years in jail, which was charged with interference with his duties. It has been 144 days since the first trial in late June. Former Ewha Womans University President Choi Kyung-hee and former dean of the National University of New Industries, Kim Kyung-sook, were sentenced to two years in jail and Namgung-gon, former dean of admissions, for one and a half years, as their first trial.

Professor Lee Won-jun was sentenced to 10 months in jail, two years of probation, Professor Lee Kyung-ok was fined 8 million won, and Professor Ha Jeong-hee of Soonchunghyang University was fined 5 million won. The court acknowledged, as in the first trial, that Choi and other Ewha Womans University professors conspired to give Chung preferential treatment in admission and academic management. Choi's daughter Chung's complicity was recognized repeatedly. In addition, he admitted that he was guilty of obstructing the investigation by Namgung Gon, former chief of the Education Ministry, and Choi's indictment of the National Assembly. As for the sentence, the court pointed out that "" the accused ignored the laws and procedures, violated principles and rules, and betrayed trust and confidence in fairness and justice.

"" After explaining the reasons for the sentence, the court admitted the original sentence, saying, Even though each defendant can take into consideration his or her own reasons, he has no choice but to hold each accused responsible for the conduct. Choi and other Ewha Womans University officials colluded by accusing Chung of influencing the interview of admitting Chung, who had applied for the annual admission of athletic talent during the early 2015 academic year, to the school. Chung also failed to attend class or submit assignments without a class by paying regular grades, causing charges of obstructing the management of Ewha Womans University's academic records.

There was another owner of an illegal parking vehicle, too. When asked why did you pull into the handicapped parking area, he disappeared without a word. Two cars parked behind the police car quickly pulled out. A white car, which had been stolen in from the parking lot, also hurriedly changed its route and left the parking lot. The team moved to a parking lot under the basement of a nearby department store. Cars were standing in three of the six handicapped parking areas. One of the cars had no cover.

If a penalty of more than one million won is decided to be settled as a penalty for violating the Public Officials Election Act and the Political Funds Law, the election will be invalid, and the mayor will eventually lose his seat as mayor after a fifth trial. Supreme Court justice Kim Jae-hyung yesterday announced the original decision of a six-year jail term and a two-year stay of execution in a review of the mayor who was indicted on charges of violating the Public Officials Election Act and the Political Funds Act. In November 2012, two years before the June 4 local elections in 2014, Mayor Kwon established the "" Great Future and Economy Research Forum "" in the division and was indicted by the traditional market visiting committee, public discussion group members, and rural workers. Prosecutors judged that the fund they received as special membership fee was illegal political funds, and applied charges of violating the Political Funds Act. After judging that the forum was a pre-election campaign prohibited under the Elections Law, the first and second governments sentenced the mayor to eight months in jail and two years in jail. However, the Supreme Court returned the case to the Daejeon High Court last August, finding it innocent of the suspicion of violating the Elections Law by setting up a similar institution, saying, "" The election campaign prohibited under the Elections Law should be interpreted strictly.

Iton-sab is placing an advertisement with the logo of the carrier on the product introduction video instead of Apple for a few seconds. The iPhone X ads will start on the 24th in the same way. The Fair Trade Commission has launched an investigation into Apple's decision last year to pass the cost of ads for iPhones and other new products to mobile operators, but has not been able to reach a conclusion yet, prompting renewed ads to continue in the past.

The FTC is also reportedly investigating the case. Taiwan imposed a fine of 20 million U.S. dollars (approximately 700 million won) on the company in 2013, and France imposed a fine of 8.5 million won (approximately $ 400 million) on the Korean carrier last April, imposing an advertising fee of approximately 8.5 million.

The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology indicate that future blood pressure greater than 13800 mm Hg will be classified as hypertension. Existing guidelines indicate that hypertension was not classified until it was more than 140 / 80mm Hg. Applying the new standard has shown that Americans who are classified as hypertension in men under the age of 45 have tripled. In addition, American women under the age of 45 will have twice as much hypertension as Americans. `` It's a scary figure, '' said Robert Kerry, a University of Virginia Medical School professor who was involved in the new guidelines. Kerry said the new standard suggests that Americans with high blood pressure increase from 72 million to 130 million, but that Americans with high blood pressure levels rise to 4.2 million people with high blood pressure medication. Kerry also diagnosed that some Americans may have to take higher doses of medicine to reach their target blood pressure. High blood pressure is a major cause of heart attack and stroke following smoking, and heart disease is one of the most dangerous diseases Americans have.

"○ People in South Korea still find it difficult to get through the special four - year-old Park Ja-ri and his brother, the four-hundred-year-olds, who live in the same city Freelance actress Jang Jung-pil says, "" It is so hard to travel between Korea and Uzbekistan every 90 days. Please help us live long and free in our grandfather's land, "" said Kim Yeon-na (22. Yeo-ah), who cried when she met with me at the Goryeo village in Wolgok-dong, Gwangsan-gu, Gwangju on July 10. It is a reminder of the pain of having been experienced during her repeated trips to Uzbekistan and reentry two years ago when she entered Korea with her three-year-old daughter. Korean Women are consulted by Gwangju Mayor of Goryeo Village (left) on August 10 by their employers. Kim, a freelance worker, Chang Jung-pil, 4, has been traveling from Uzbekistan to Korea once every three months since entering the country with a short-term visa (C3-8) in October 2015. In case of a four-year-old Goryeo, when he or she reaches the age of 20, they must leave for Russia or Uzbekistan, where they were born every 90 days, and then return to Korea. Under the present law, overseas Koreans are considered overseas Koreans until the age of three, but foreigners are classified as foreigners from the age of four. Even working at random while leaving her daughter at a children's home makes it difficult to make even enough money to buy plane tickets, Kim said. Leaders of a community in Gwangju and women of Goryeo take a photo in front of the Center for Support to Goryeo Villages in Wolgok-dong, Gwangsan-gu, Gwangju, Korea on July 10. Freelance Chang Jung-pil has been forced to move to Russia 80 years but Koreans here are still living fragile lives. The Moon Jae-in government stay for four years old but easing conditions with poor language and economic hardship because of poor employment environments, complaining of voices. Focused on WooJeong Affairs ; and the Koreans, who moved to a great Russia without much harm in the Japanese occupation. In 1937, Stalin during the Japanese Colonial Period by extreme discrimination, were moved to Central Asia and the privations of life. Many Korean residents who visit their grandparents ' hometowns are concentrated in cities around Russia. That is because they need the support of the ethnic Korean community to find jobs or educate their children in strange Korea. Of these, the ethnic Korean village in Gwangju is considered one of the most representative Korean communities. Currently, about 4,000 of the 40,000 Koreans who are in Korea are living in the areas of Wolgok, Sanjeong and Usan-dong in Gwangsan-gu. It is the second most densely populated area since Ansan, Gyeonggi Province. Unlike Ansan, which has gathered to find jobs, Kwangju is usually settled with its family for actual residence. Consultationers living in the Gwang-ju Koryo village await Uzbekistan's Minister of Employment and Labor Aktamu Kaitov who visited the village on July 7. Freelancers Jang Jeong-pil and Koreans began to build nests in Gwangju in the early 2000s. As they sought jobs in farming villages or nearby Hanam industrial complex outside of Gwangsan-gun, they lived in the suburbs where housing was cheaper. That's why Bulgok-dong and Appan-dong studio homes are called "" Goryeo Villages. "" The center is home to the Koryo Village Community Support Center, and is home to local children's centers, youth culture centers, counseling centers, and shelters. Schools for children born in Central Asia and who have entered the nation are also active, including a multicultural school, volunteering, cooperation and media centers. Korean Women are consulted by their employers and their children by their representatives at the Koryo Village in Gwangju yesterday. Freelancer Jang Jeong-pil, however, often claims to have difficulties in life in Korea despite the support of various communities. For instance, the four-year-olds of the Goryeo Dynasty, they leave for Uzbekistan or Kazakhstan every three months before returning to Korea. In Moon Jae-in, the government until June 2019, which temporarily consideration four tax measures so they can stay here. After receiving a letter from Kim Alexandra (56, female) in August of this year, the presidential office released a visa to live with the elderly, relieving them of the pain of separating their parents. Kim through the 'Moon Jae-in to the president a letter of plea' last August, III, taking into account ' brought to Korea two years after 2016, while less than six times left for Russia. Refer to the daughter of a strange journey back stop ' appeal. Baenikita County, Korea's four-year-old brother, and Park Ellizabet gaze out of class from Saenal School, a multicultural school in Gwangju Monday. However, many people say that the government's latest measures are too blind. The ministry's enforcement ordinance says, "" Parents are the fourth-generation Goryeo resident in South Korea, "" and Koreans without parents are still not legally protected. Kim Ye-na, a 4-year-old Goryeo who entered Korea with her daughter, has also had to leave the country and enter the country repeatedly. The poor Korean language of the Goryeo people is also one of the biggest problems experienced in Korean life. Most Korean workers are working part-time in factories and rural areas because they can not communicate well. In the Kyung-ju Koryo village, 51 percent (1780) work for manufacturers and 45 percent (1600) work as day laborers. Korean four-year-olds who were born in Uzbekistan and entered the country on July 10 take Korean lessons at Saenal School, a multicultural school in Gwangju. Freedom Center for the Performing Arts and Culture of Gwangju, Principal Lee Chun-young (57), said, "" The Special Executives who have been appointed to the National Assembly, lost their right to obtain independence fighters, and are strongly encouraged to revise their language and culture in Korea. "" Various cases of delayed payment of wages and morale are also being reported, as a bait to extend visas or seek work for the four generations of residents of Gwangju Koryo Village and freelance workers. Last August, a four-hundred-three-three-million member of the Supreme Court of Seoul National University said, "" I will give you permanent residency for your children. "" The head of the Kwangju Koryo Village, a town that is currently accepting approval, said, "" Even though a growing number of Koreans are hoping to get together in Gwangju, we still have a hard time resolving visas or jobs. "" Consultationers living in the Gwang-ju Koryo village await Uzbekistan's Minister of Employment and Labor Aktamu Kaitov who visited the village on July 7. There are also growing calls for stronger medical support for freelance Chang Jung-pil. Koreans are not willing to pay hospital bills if they fall ill within three months of entering the country because they are entitled to health insurance when they stay in Korea for more than 90 days. Sohn Ebgeni (36), a ethnic Korean worker in Gwangju, died in a bus last September while on his way home to treat his illness. Son had a severe swelling of his legs when he arrived in Korea last August to work at a refrigerator assembly, but received no medical insurance as he has been here for only 40 days. Eventually, unable to endure the pain, Son went to Uzbekistan for treatment and suffered a bowel movement. Im Chae-wan (66), director of the Institute of Foreign Affairs at Chonnam Province, Gwangju Korean-Free Chang Jung-pil, a four-nation foreign language professor, said, "" People who can handle visas for overseas Koreans under the same law are able to live abroad. "" Meanwhile, the Kwangju Koryo village is very interesting to the two governments because 80 percent (3,200) of the residents of Gwangju are from Uzbekistan. There is the last seven days of Uzbekistan akeutamu Kai Levitov syapeukateu Mir in coming to visit of the Minister of Employment and Labor 21, Antonovich Uzbekistan.The president's visit is expected. Park Yong-soo, 60, head of the project to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the forced relocation of Korean residents, said, The Uzbekistan government will soon set up consuls in Gwangju, adding, "" We should also actively discuss visa issues for local residents who live in Korea. Uzbekistan's Minister of Employment and Labor Aktamukatov says thank you after receiving a bouquet of flowers from women living in a Koryo village in Gwangju on July 7. Choi Kyung-ho, the principal of Saenal School, a multicultural school, explained on July 10, "" visa improvements and the need for Korean language education are needed.

"Lee Myung-bak, the former president is at Incheon International Airport before leaving for the Middle East through December. . / News 1 © the first applicable law provisions and the statute of limitations is the reporter Min Kyung Suk news 2017.11.12 mb the key to the investigation 'complicity in the political involvement' as never before, but the Criminal Code (= 1 News, Seoul, Korea) can theoretically Yoon Jin-Hee press.= the prosecution's point is facing Lee Myung-bak, former president. Prosecutors said they are speeding up their investigation because they believe the NIS and the military engaged in political maneuvering through comments and opinions during the MB government. Over the past 11th court has instructed military cyber command by mobilizing public opinion control activities at the time Lee Myung-bak government accused of an arrest warrant for former Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin.Issued. Won Sei-hoon told the scandal, former president is former minister Kim, as well as comments to be being held on remand is government intervention yesterday on the activities of the politics from former NIS chiefs as looking at. 14 The prosecution is currently the top politics a lady doctor reported to the police dragnet - framed the former president national agencies, narrowing the shape. In the legal profession, president of Lee's investigation and punishment that can affect the possibility of the major variables as the 'applicable law provisions' and 'the statute of limitations'. After his retirement, is of the prosecution's investigation into targeting the former president in four years and nine months. The former president is suspected of involvement during his current term as prime minister and president to properly investigate the allegations they happened nine years and nine months, including for five years of his term.The investigation should hear. The legal community is paying attention to the fact that the prosecution has long since committed cases to investigate. So the prosecution is far from interested in how it can prove what happened 10 years ago. Even if prosecutors believe that there is a former president found of a NIS comments with a cyber army's top - framed. What if has room for a law about how to apply the law. ◇ Kim Kwan-jin and Won are new offenses, so former ministers Kim and Won are accused of violating the military criminal and NIS laws, respectively. The problem is that the military criminal law does not apply to civilians except for exceptions set by the law, and the NIS law was made to apply to NIS employees. In other words former Secretary of State and former director of Circle has emerged in a position to commit acts of political involvement because it is a 'Sonderdelikt' crime, the former president of 'accomplice' even if found guilty of.Can be established is should hear about again. Many lawyers who are military or military criminal law because agents did not the case of the former president and top intelligence agency, is if we can be punished with ‘accomplice’ of the law.Obscure, valuation. The lawyers, however, had thought inside that they could punish the criminals as partners in the crime, and had been found to have a serious crime, they expected a legal battle would be inevitable if the prosecution and trial continue. ◇ Measurement ‘misconduct’ blacklist and be president 'The former president of the shutdown ’' White in office seven years is the statute of limitations ' suspected and 140 billion won in a dozen investments recovery operation.Also under suspicion of involvement. The former president and this corresponds to 'misconduct' if the suspicion is found to be true. The criminal law sets a maximum sentence of five years in jail for abusing one's authority. The statute of limitations on abuse of power is seven years. According to the principle statute of limitations, the prosecution can hold responsible only for crimes committed seven years before it completed its investigation and filed a lawsuit. In other words, according to the principles, as of November 2010, it is impossible to assess any involvement in the withdrawal of the investment from the investment. However, the president during a crime of criminal prosecution or punishment can not be term due to practical problems that a statute of limitations is suspended. Shanghai massacre of 12 at the time of Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, the two former president and military forces are committed and the May 18 Democratic Movement 'the statute of limitations' issues emerged in the criminal prosecution for events such as events.It. At that time, the court is come up with analysis that the president a statute of limitations in office stationary. In addition, the president of president because it bans the criminal prosecution office to freeze the statute of limitations while there is no particular objection. Into cases of Lee Myung-bak, former president, tenure as president for events that took place during the contra non valentem agere nulla currit praescriptio After his retirement in February, 2013, as its starting point will be revived. Accordingly, the prosecution without the statute of limitations, the former president of the misconduct that took place throughout the period of events in the investigations and prosecution can be. But the prosecution of gravity of the time because the events long ago overcome constraints from the realistic and relevant evidence, the former president of the charges.It is still skeptical comments you may report that will not be easy to prove.Jurist @. ▶. .. ▶. bo. gi. gwallyeon. nyuseuving the News and Photo of PyeongChang 2018.

How did you get into this sexy dance? At first, I was just asking for it from the top, but it got worse and worse. After work, I stay for another two or three hours to perfect my dance practice until night, and then go to work at dawn the next day.

"Military officials were talking about North Korean soldiers who were wounded by a shooting in the Joint Security Area at Ajou University Hospital in Suwon, Gyeonggi-do when they defected from the South and were immediately transferred to the North from the South.▽ South Korean Peninsula Defense to Surrender = North Korea will not be affected by the joint defection of 12 people this year … "" ("" Experts say, "" Among them, the process of defection from North Korea is not likely to be divided into one "") Major media including North Korea, the Korean Central News Agency did not respond to the incident until July 14. It is the third time this year that North Korea has defected from the South since June 13 and 23, and North Korea did not respond much to the defection. However, many predict that the North's defection will have considerable repercussions. This is because they are defection from the Joint Security Area (JSA). Usually, the Panmunjeom JSA is known to select and deploy children whose members are good graduates and who are loyal to the Labor Party. It is also noted that the number of North Korean defectors who defect via the Northern Limit Line (NLL) and the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) is on the rise amid the decreasing number of defectors. This year alone, a total of 12 people have defected from North Korea, the highest in three years. Gimpo to defect to swim for the northern peninsula the Hangang Rivers estuary is man in his twenties last June the same month, the rich (父子) surrender even been on a ship in the East. It was the third time this year that North Korea defected from the South last year and in 2015. Cho Han-beom, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, said, Since taking office, Kim has not shown a sensitive response to the North Korean defection, and has recently demonstrated that the North Korean defectors in the form of defection will increase lightly. However, many predict that this incident will cause a change in the inter-Korean relationship or the situation on the Korean Peninsula. Some point out that the North will not take issue with this incident because it is clear that the defection process by shooting 40 rounds of bullets at the North Korean soldiers who defect from the South is very clear. Unlike when we have many suspicions about the defection from the Chinese restaurant, Kim Yong-hyun, a North Korean studies professor at Dongguk University in Seoul, said, It is unlikely that this incident would affect the situation in the South and North, possibly because it is a minus one. Meanwhile, the North Korean army is currently being treated in the intensive care unit for gunshot wounds it received during its defection, preventing the investigation into its name, class, and motive for defection. Some say that the North is unlikely to accuse the government of kidnapping the incident or call for the abduction of defectors by the South, but it can not rule out the abduction.Report! They want to buy products made with "" Line Friends "" characters from Korea, including "" Brown "" and "" Connie "" the bear and rabbit. On the same day, Line Friends ' earnings from one timole amounted to about 4.6 billion won. It was the third consecutive year of its sales of toys for infants in its shopping mall. It recorded 1.5 billion won in sales in 2015 and 2.5 billion won last year on the day of the mining system. Line Friends said on July 13, This year, it sold more than 2 billion won in the first hour of its sale, adding, 10,000 key hooks for the handbag and 6,000 supplementary batteries with characters on them were sold separately. It is not only China. Korean characters are very popular these days. It is called the "" Korean Wave "", which is similar to K-pop's popularity. Line Friends, a Market-sized Naver subsidiary, has established itself as a global character brand with stores in 87 locations. This August, he opened a regular store in Times Square, downtown New York in the U.S. Pororo, which was shown in animations by Iconics and Occon in 2005, is estimated to have made 400 billion won in sales in 90 countries around the world so far. The Rhett Robot, Youngsil's transformation car, Tobot, was also popular as it was exported to France, Russia, and Taiwan. The character industry represented by the U.S. team Mickey Mouse (Disney) and Japan's Hello Kitty (Sanrio) is growing globally, but Korea's growth is especially scary. According to the Korea Creative Content Agency, the domestic character market has grown fivefold from 2.07 trillion won in 2005 to 11.57 trillion won last year, or 11 years. The global character market is expected to grow 1.2 times from $ 151 billion in 2009 to $ 186.6 billion (approximately 202 trillion won) next year. The character "" Hallyu "" originated primarily from the cute and adorable characters that can appeal to men and women of all ages and men around the world. We can successfully integrate the success of the traditional character industry, in which several characters appear like idol groups and group consumers among them, said Moon Ji-hyun, a economist at Mirae Asset. There are 11 kinds of characters in a group at Line Friends. Pororo also has friends like the crocodile, Crong, and the penguin, Patty. As a result, it is good to use them conveniently, even when applied to a wide range of products, ranging from ballpoint pens to mood lighting. If you look further into the matter, the strategy of narrowing the scope of the targets (the number of layers) was excellent. Park Seok-hwan, a Korean studies professor, said, We have had many characters for children and products in the U.S. and other global markets, but we also found that younger children and young people with jobs were not enough to capture. Though popular characters such as Dooly have been around in Korea, the reason it did not work in the world market is because they competed in the Red Ocean, a market dominated by Mickey Mouse. Companies could maximize the popularity of characters by properly launching localization strategies, including setting up shop lines tailored to each country. Experts point out that the Korean Wave has turned out to be an industrial achievement that was not easy at home and abroad, such as conflicts with China. "" Character industry is a high-value industry with ' one-source multI-use ', "" said an official at the Korea Creative Content Agency."
"[The Seoul Shinmun] The warship carries a World Heritage application for the Japanese government rejects is Japanese military sexual slavery records and Japan don't like when I see the ugly acts to UNESCO for fairness.Is it too much to expect, "" UNESCO World Heritage site last month, 31, eight countries, including the Philippines, South Korea and China is (unesco) of 14 civic organizations are applying for a world world heritage sites designated records.Let us finally to the inclusion decisions infuriated South Korean netizens ' reaction. UNESCO is about pending decision could harm relations between Japan and those of its neighbors more relevant parties of the debate inclusion of the Japanese military sexual slavery records said. When the U.S. decided to leave UNESCO last month, Israel announced it would join the group, and China said it would increase its contributions to UNESCO. China is expected to be the country with the highest UNESCO dues starting in 2019. Let's take a look at why UNESCO, an international organization in charge of education, science, and cultural exchange, has become the arena of competition among world powers.Japan's Hashima Island, which was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2015, is called a warship due to its ship-like shape. Japan also failed to keep its promise to announce the fact that the underwater mine was a legacy of the Meiji Industrial Revolution and that it had been forcibly drafted by the Korean into the war. Tokyo, Muslims, Yonhap News Agency China, 1944 Song Shan mountains of (松山) filmed South Korean prisoners of Japanese military sexual slavery in the Fortress Wall of Seoul, Yonhap News Agency last year UNESCO World Heritage Sites.Failed to reach the list of city officials, as well as the Cultural Heritage Administration is a big shock. In 2012, the Seoul Metropolitan Government installed a Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education at the Culture Headquarters and spent about 30 billion won every year on restoration of the Seoul Metropolitan City Wall. Park Won-soon, the mayor of Seoul, was confident of registering his World Heritage Site as he walked directly into the capital city with reporters who entered the city two years ago.We want to re-appointment UNESCO World Heritage Register as soon as possible, but no specific plans have been made yet. I do not think the World Heritage Committee will be affected by internal politics such as the withdrawal of the United States or the stronger influence of China as it specializes in registering World Heritage Sites in the World Heritage Committee. Even if it becomes a World Heritage, it does not receive financial support from UNESCO in terms of preserving the heritage. That is because the contributions that Korea and other countries pay are used first for the legacy in crisis. However, the UNESCO's listing of World Heritage Sites is favorable for receiving the national budget because it means that it received recognition from the international community, and it is effective in attracting tourists as well.Fortress Wall of Japanese military sexual slavery, not, historically neutral cultural heritage, Memory fault with historical records or documents like the Nanjing Massacre of judging whether or not listed.The countries is fierce war of diplomacy will. The reason why the United States seceded from UNESCO is quite political. The U.S. has withdrawn from UNESCO twice before, but on the surface of the treaty in 1984, it followed the loose management of the secretariat, which was withdrawn with the U.K. and Singapore due to the growing Soviet influence. In 2002, during the Bush administration, he re-enlisted UNESCO, 18 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The U.S. seceded again with Israel, citing the political reasons behind being palestin-friendly.UNESCO, which emphasizes cultural diversity, officially accepted Palestine as a member in 2011, and complaints were growing in Israel and its longtime conflict with Israel, the United States. U.S. President Barack Obama, former president is opposition to Palestinian membership of UNESCO approved $ 70 million in annual dues paid over and hung up. The suspended payment has become a delinquent payment and the United States is preparing to leave UNESCO to take responsibility for the $ 550 million in arrears. The United States has lost the right to vote at the General Assembly since 2013 because it has not paid its dues.UNESCO Secretary General Irina Bokova called the departure of the United States a "" loss of multilateral diplomacy, "" saying, "" The clash of cultures is still rampant and the United States is pushing for peace at a time. ""The financial crisis caused by the withdrawal of the U.S. in 1984 was overcome by member states by expanding contributions. Some reports say that when the U.S. stopped paying its dues, UNESCO urged other member countries to pay their dues quickly. It is not known whether the United Nations asked for contributions from UNESCO.In 1999, Koichiro Matsuura, the first Asian, was appointed as UNESCO's secretary-general. Over the next 10 years, Koichiro served as secretary general, during which Japan paid the most UNESCO money to replace the United States. The UNESCO contributions are distributed to each country on the same basis as the United Nations, with one country sharing as much money as possible. After the U.S.'s re-import, Japan's share of its shares dropped to the world's second largest."" More and more Chinese tourists are visiting UNESCO World Heritage sites, "" the BBC said, responding to the United States ` withdrawal from UNESCO and China's reaction. In addition, Chinese historical sites were recently selected as UNESCO World Heritage sites. International organizations such as the United Nations and UNESCO were founded as U.S. capitals and were also a tool to support the U.S.'s status as the world's strongest power. However, the United States insisted on quitting when international organizations did not follow its will. China, which has sought after the U.S.'s position since the 20th century, announced that it would strengthen its contributions to the international community through the 19th party convention that ended last month.The Japanese military sexual slavery records for the UNESCO decision was made way in Japan one of Japan, Japan, China and Russia, three economies of intense energy diplomacy could end up victory end of story. Japan's powerful weapon was half of the total cost of the U.S. (22 percent) who announced their withdrawal from Japan. At the rate of 10 percent, the Japanese government is a big player in UNESCO with a huge amount of money in reserve. It is known that Japan has not yet paid 3.85 billion yen (approximately 37.6 billion won) per year in annual dues from April to May.Japan`s Foreign Minister Taro Kono told a news conference on July 1, We are now reviewing all contributions and contributions to international organizations. Japan barely paid its dues last year to the Chinese government when it became a World Records Heritage site due to the Chinese application for the 2015 Nanjing Massacre. Some analyze that Japan has become more favorable because UNESCO could not ignore what Japan had to pay when the U.S. dropped out of the program. Japanese officials said, Japanese officials have clearly learned that the UNESCO is now so weak they can not operate normally that if Japan fails to pay its dues, it would be on the brink of death. Japanese military sexual slavery records in the end the screening process was used as a weapon powerful Japan is the story. The contribution and withdrawal from membership countries is also the favorite cards used by powerful countries such as the United States and Japan to influence international organizations.UNESCO is not the only one to be swayed by powerful nations. The current international organization system depending on the contribution of certain countries will inevitably depend on the wishes of the powerful countries to manage them. That is why China promised to pay the maximum amount of its dues to China by becoming the world's top power, beyond the U.S. As the United States seceded from UNESCO, Chinese representatives said China would pay 22 percent of the dues to the UNESCO organization starting in 2019, said an official at the Korean UNESCO. China is trying to expand its influence on international organizations, including UNESCO, as it grows stronger, Chang Guohong, professor at Fudan University in China, explained.UNESCO's contributions to the organization, like the United Nations, are based on objective economic indicators such as national income and foreign debt. No country shares more than 22 percent, and the share of the poorest countries is less than 0.001 percent. After all, the contribution of the international body is a barometer of the country's national power. UNESCO officials say, "" UNESCO was also created by a lot of political backgrounds and had to stand apart from the United States. "" And they say the current international system that relies on the right and left sides of the world is the only one that determines whether to have a strong voice.Journalist Yoon Chang-soo geo@seoul.co.kr"

Daejeon Mayor Kwon Seon-taek said in a speech Monday, "" I accept the outcome of the trial in a sweeping sense, right after my jail sentence was confirmed. "" Mayor Kwon said in the morning of the briefing room, Thank you for your help in getting the administrative rights done and I felt very sorry for the incident. I also deeply appreciate the government officials who remained silent and helped me to do my best despite the trial, he said. Still, he did not hide his regret over the results of the annual election, saying, It is not desirable for politicians to form a foundation based on the judgment that it is a political fund law. He said, "" I will tell you more about my future course of action later. "" Mayor Kwon will have a ceremony at the City Hall Hall Hall Hall Hall at 10:00 a.m. on July 15.Daejeon Mayor Kwon Seon-taek leaves the court on Feb. 16 after receiving a suspended prison sentence for two years in a trial for the execution of a public office election law and a breach of political funding laws. The Supreme Court's third edition (Supreme Court justice Kim Jae-hyung) confirmed its original decision yesterday when Mayor Kwon received a six-month suspended prison sentence after being handed over to the court on suspicion of election law and political funding. After losing the 19th general elections, he formed a forum to discuss future economic affairs in Daejeon in October 2012, where he held pre-dictational activities such as visiting traditional markets and exploring local businesses. Prosecutors also imposed charges against the mayor of the political funds law on all of the fees collected by the forum members as illegal political funds, as the forum itself is an illegal organization. In recognition of the two charges, the governor admitted that he received eight months in jail with a suspended sentence of two years. However, the Supreme Court judged that the forum was not a campaign organization, and that the mayor's forum was not a pre-election campaign, and retaliated against the political funding law when all of the charges were found innocent. In the second trial round, the judge donated money to a Forum member and decided that the use of forum funds and labor amounts to corruption in political funds, and decided in June to suspend the execution of the Supreme Court's ruling.Choi Doo-sun, a newspaper reporter, balanceds@hankookilbo.com[ⓒ Do not illegally transfer or redistribute by Hankook Ilbo (hankookilbo.com),]"
""" If you don't have to pay for it, you'd rather have an iPhone X (10), but if you see how much it costs, Apple's iPhone 8 hasn't been the answer. "" Unprecedented demand for an iPhone X, which was unveiled at the same time as the iPhone 8, has resulted in the iPhone's new product launching scene being rather sluggish.Apple iPhone 8 (left), iPhone 8 + (right), / journalist Park Sung-woo (right) recently met a man who bought an iPhone 8 +. Asked about his opinion on the iPhone 8 Plus, A said, "" I used the iPhone 6Gb/s to be more affordable. My iPhone 8 has been priced up to date, and my iPhone 8 has been more affordable since my purchase price was raised. ""As there is no big difference in performance between the iPhone 8 and the iPhone X, the iPhone 8, the iPhone 8 +, and the iPhone X cost 990,000 won, or 1,130,000 won, respectively, on a 64GB basis. The iPhone 8 is the cheapest, and the iPhone X is the most expensive. However, the application processor (AP), which acts as the brain for all three products, uses the same chip, ' A11 Bionic. 'The operating system is the same as Apple's iOS 11. AP and OS are the most important hardware and software that determines the performance of smartphones.Like the iPhone X, the iPhone 8 series supports fast charging and wireless charging. All three devices support the Qiu wireless charging standard : iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X. Recently, more and more households and car makers have been supporting the Qiu standard.The iPhone 8 + camera is the same as the iPhone X. The iPhone 8 + and the iPhone X were equipped with a 7 million-pixel front camera and a 12 million-pixel rear dual camera. IPhone 8, iPhone 8 + and iPhone X can record high-definition (UHD) images by 60 % Gracib (p) and full HD video by frame count (fps) per second.The iPhone 8 + camera functions were satisfactory, too. In portrait mode (photo taking technique to highlight the subject matter by blurred the background), it can be very noisy to take pictures in the dark. However, the iPhone 8 + did not make a lot of noise even in a darker environment. In addition, the iPhone 8 + has an additional portrait lighting mode, allowing users to edit the photo as if they were using a lighting device.The Trouton function, which adjusts the color of the display to ambient temperatures, is also available with both the iPhone 8 and iPhone X.A before (left) and after (right) use of the Trouton Display. It is one of the features that iPhone 8 users are most pleased about. It is the model of the iPhone 8 plus the back, but when it comes to design, I was sorry that it did not make a big difference from the iPhone 7. The iPhone 8 is finished with glass at the back, but the smartphone case makes it hard to see the difference between the rear end material. Even the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 + are about the same size as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 +. Height and length are less than 1 mm. Smartphones can also be used as a case.If one does not know the difference between LCD ⋅ OLED and the iPhone 8 in Korea, the iPhone X, which will be released on July 24 in Korea, has a significantly competitive edge. The iPhone X was equipped with the first OLED display in the iPhone, not the conventional LCD display. This Super Letina Display has excellent contrast ratios and supports a wide range of colors for clarity.The iPhone X had no physical home button and no touch ID. The ID was first installed on the iPhone 4S in 2013, changing the way iPhones were used. A touch ID is a security lock that unlocks when a fingerprint is registered and a finger is placed on the device. The iPhone X introduced a face ID function that recognizes the face of a person instead of a touch ID.Apple Senior Vice President Craig Federlich is using the face ID of the iPhone X.With no home button, the iPhone X appears to be a new user (Swiff) while traveling between apps. Swiff works by finger pushing the bar at the bottom of the screen.In conclusion, consumers who want to use the latest models of their iPhones, such as OLEDs displays and face IDs, prefer an iPhone X. However, some new features, such as OLED displays, require an additional cost of 300,000 to 450,000 won. For users who find the price of an iPhone X burdensome and who are not sensitive to the difference between OLED-LCD displays, the iPhone 8 series may be a good choice.Former Minister of Public Health and Welfare Moon Hyung-jin, who was sentenced to two counts of "" national pension damages "" in the ruling on July 14 when former minister of public welfare administration Yoon Dong-jin was sentenced to be in Seoul for the civil affairs suit filed on foxpsw@chosunbiz.com]chosunbiz.com 2017.11.14 mon@yna.co.kr (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) gangaeran Journalist : Samsung Corporation, Jeil Industries Co. secured circumstantial evidence that the involvement of Cheong Wa Dae on the merger of Park Geun-hye while acknowledging the court to be true.I'm president, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics Lee Jae-yong remaining 'gukjjeong nongdan' such as the court case is expected to affect. Seoul High Court Criminal Department 10 (Lee Jae-young, chief judge) acknowledged the involvement of Cheong Wa Dae in the decision to merge Samsung with Moon Hyung-pyo, former health and welfare minister, in an appeals court Thursday. The first move did not separately determine whether there was any intervention by Moon in the process of pressuring the pension authority to approve the merger. But the appeal was former minister, before the president to the effect is 'Just pack all of the event voting rights for a merger, Pension Service' as was aware of the directive.I figured out. Choi Won-young, the Ministry of the trial before the president's instructions for former presidential secretary for employment, welfare to Ministry employees through the merger, including former Health and Human Services secretary, Kim Jin-su, on the agenda.Did you see to take care of it. Former Economy Minister Ahn Jong-beom was actively involved in this process, being briefed by the investment committee on the results of their decision, and was also informed of the fact that Ahn was intimate with others and had a working exchange. Lee Jae-yong, vice president and Park Geun-hye, former president of Samsung Electronics Lee Jae-yong and circumstances before the president is that the involvement of Cheong Wa Dae in Samsung Electronics [Yonhap news agency offering tv].The trial also key issues. The special prosecution and prosecution see the merger as a device to take over the management control of Samsung Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong. Samsung Park Geun-hye government merger in exchange for helping Mr. Jung Yoo Ra, daughter of riding support taking bribes, such as the company choesunsil the keynote that. Park of former vice president and to allegations of bribery are substantiated that corrupt favors were exchanged between circumstances, needs to be backed up with. If this occurs, the logic that the merger was a management issue of individual companies unrelated to Cheong Wa Dae could be broken. The door on mergers of individual companies, the presidential office has lower court ruling of the former minister to exercise undue influence that it can be seen as a judgment that in the Park.For vice president and is expected to have an adverse effect. The independent counsel and the prosecution is Park of former vice president and the door on trial in a former minister's appeal ruling, expected to submit them as a means of proof in corruption. It's just that presidential intervention is accepted even if Samsung's riding support and other transaction is a bribe, whether for the judgment of the former vice president and the Park event.The court is expected to make individually. The ruling also implies that the pension fund was in violation of its process in favor of the merger. Hong Wan-seon, former director of the National Pension Service, was guilty of harming the pension funds by ordering investment committee members to merge. The court ruled that Hong encouraged investors to approve the merger by explaining the figures of the fabricated synergy, resulting in profit for major shareholders such as Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong and other damages to the pension funds. This is interpreted as having a gap in legal judgment compared to the first ruling of the Samsung Group's ruling on the cancellation of the merger on July 19. Regarding the voting process at the National Pension Corp., the court found that the then chairman of the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency saw no evidence of involvement in deciding the pros and cons of mergers between the Health and Welfare Ministry or fund operations. In addition, it was not enough to say that the approval by the KSPO's investment committee itself was able to tolerate huge losses in terms of content or undermine the value of shareholders. In the end, interest is focused on the decision of the civil and criminal case authorities on whether or not the process of exercising voting rights of the national pension fund was legitimate. In addition, Samsung Electronics Lee Jae-yong merger Samsung's bribery scandal and Park Geun-hye, former president of a lower court's ruling, an appellate court, a judiciary judgment of the problem appeared to be made.I have your attention. aeran@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"Field : ' I'm not your yaddong '. From left, I heard the name "" Ojai "" from a Korean sexual violence counseling center, Seo Jae-rang, singer and director, Professor Inayoung Inayoung of Jungang University, and singer Oh Ji-eun. Lee Eun-sol. At first, I thought, ' I've never filmed a video before, ' but then I thought, ' Maybe my opponent did, even if I didn't. '  I checked the video, and I wasn't, but I wasn't really glad that that woman in the video could be the victim. I thought maybe it would all be over. "" Now, there was a scene of Molka, revenge video, synthesis -- a scene of increasingly violent cyber-bullying -- a scene that allowed us to listen to women. A talk concert on the off track of cyber-bullying held at Mike Impact Square in Jongno on November 11. The event was organized by the Seoul Metropolitan Government and organized by the Korean Center for Sexual Violence and the Center for Cyber Sexual Violence in Korea. Singer Oh Eun-eun was in charge of the social affairs, and Professor Lee Na-young, singer and director Yeong-woo, activist Oh Mae-eun of the Korean Sexual Violence Consultation Center, and activist Seo Rang of the Center for Cyber Sexual Violence in Korea were in attendance.The event was made up of three parts. The first part, "" I Came Here, "" dealt with the story of cyber-bullying and the second part, "" It's not my fault, "" handed over Mike to the audience and listened directly to the participants ' stories. In the last part of Chapter 3, ' Help me! ', women talked about how to behave in these situations. About 200 people attended the event and filled the audience. The lucrative Korean market for sexual assault in the cyber world has a unique structure. No company officially produces or distributes porn because pornography is illegal under Korean law. As a result, the porn products distributed in Korea consist of ‘ non-questioning ’ overseas porn and non-individualized scenes called ‘ Korea-Japan Night ’. It is all illegal and most of the time no copyright is issued, so it is cheap. Countless ' yadong ' without owners are distributed via the Webhard for tens of won per game. Webhard is so big that its daily sales reached 300 million won, said Seo Rang-rang, an activist at the Korea Cyber Crime Prevention Center. Recently, an insurance company tried to release an insurance product to pay for removal when Molka was distributed, but was hit hard by public criticism. Once money comes into play, the violence that women experience becomes commodities. That is why it is necessary to view the sexual violence against the victims of cyber warfare not as an individual level of criminal activity but as a structural problem that requires national intervention. Non-Automobile photography, or molka, is not a aberration of some wicked individuals doing "" bad things, "" but an industry that uploads thousands of times a day and downloads tens of times a day. ▲ Poster-Traumatic OFF Concert A singer Oh Ji-eun, who is in charge of the Center for Cyber Sexual Violence in Korea, said he had a video clip containing Oh Ji-eun, was chosen as the main character of the actual episode of cyber sexual violence. "" One day, I heard from a friend of mine that there was a sex video running around under the name of ' Oh Ji-eun, ' "" Oh said. "" I didn't even think, ' I didn't have to shoot one at first. ' "" "" I didn't see the video, but I didn't think it would be a good thing that the woman in that video wasn't mine. "" "" Maybe it was all, "" he said. "" We talk, write, and make music on our own, but Molka is out of my control, "" she said.The participants then shared their experiences with themselves. One woman refused to attract a boy who used to live in the same apartment and said she had posted her personal information and contact information to a "" condition meeting "" site to retaliate. The caller ID has found out that the criminal is the boy, but his parents say, "" Let's not see red flag in the neighborhood. How did you go about it? "" Lee Na-young, a professor at Jungang University, pointed out that men develop aggression throughout their lives. In the novel, Kim Ji-young, an 82 year old, tells her teacher to change places when an elementary school student teased her and her classmates asked her to change their seat. "" It's because he likes you, "" the teacher said, rather than criticize Kim Ji-young, "" because you are so tactless. "" Professor Lee Na-young takes this scene as an example and says, "" Women are considered to be the victims of violence, and they are considered to be the most suspicious and ungentlemanly bitch. ""Though it is legal, it is not enough to ask what kind of punishment the offenders receive until the system is improved. "" Taking and spreading a film was a huge violence on the victim, but I still felt like giving up on every single one of them, "" he said. "" If I went to the police station, I wouldn't have enough understanding of the crime, "" and "" web browser. "" "" Even though the distribution of video clips deals with sensitive contents of individuals, it is also a burden to the victims that they have to make a statement in an open place without an independent testimony space, "" he said. The institutions are poor, but not as negative as they seem. When the Sexual Violence Advisory Center of Korea opened in 1991, we don`t even know the name of sexual violence. Sometimes, I could not even say ` sexual violence ` when I opened an account at a bank. As ordinary citizens learn more about what sexual violence is committed on the Internet and observe the actual punishment of these cases, they are optimistic about a change in society. ▲ Leeunsol A last performance that says, "" We're all activists. "" When all of us are silent about something wrong, it's as if that situation were supposed to change, and that's why. Singer Riund said he found a molkabout on the subway and reported it. Although there were no punishments for not taking a close look at the body parts, he added, "" If you don't stop talking and speak your voice, it will change society someday. ""The same is true of people who see or share non-mobile photos around. Organizers have created an open chat room with topics like ' What to Say Not to Victims ' and ' What You Want To Say When You Meet Violators. ' Spectators personally expressed their opinions in chat rooms, which were read and talked on the screen by the hosts. One participant said, "" I also want to tell the perpetrator in the real world how much trouble it is when I see something on my cell phone that shouldn't have been told to the victim like ' You should have been more careful. ' ""Professor Lee Na-young said, I hope people here can go out and tell stories now. The event concluded with an impressive performance to honor the host's ‘ Activist ’ with the promise of the host and audience to act together.Event organized by the Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center said cyber sexual violence is increasing interest in relieving hangovers and group activities as much as ordinary citizens the opportunity to speak.It is important to raise the idea that cyber the seriousness of sexual violence through the ""and said the tenor of the event."" event is shared throughout society, to improve problem.I wish we could take the power is a move the the wind.Copyright : (c) Oh MyNews, no piracy and no redistribution ; cheer for this article!

"Last year, the price of Hwawon and field is rising ... The supply is so great that the price is so high, and the consumers and farmers have been so happy every year. Haenam is one of the largest cabbage producing areas in Korea, accounting for 13 percent of the total production of autumn cabbages and 80 percent of cabbages in the winter.In Haenam, the farm contract culture between farmers and merchants is established. It is a method in which merchants provide seed and fertilizer and farmers grow cabbages and receive the cost of cultivation. The cost of farming, which stood at 10,000 to 12,000 won per pyeong last year, remained around 6,000 won this year. It is because the cabbage prices have dropped sharply. Kim said, Prices were good last year when cabbage was ruined by the wet sea, and we grew more this year because of higher cabbage prices in the highland region, and the money came in for a good harvest. It is known that the market was inactive due to the collapse of cabbage prices, and some merchants lost contact with the firm by giving up contract money after signing a contract in advance. "" Last year, cabbage prices were so high that it is hard to predict how much cabbage prices will rise again this fall, so it is difficult for farmers to predict how much cabbage prices will increase in the fall. As high prices were established from last year to this summer, the area of land has grown and the supply is abundant. As the production of cabbages decreased due to wet sea damage and root cyst diseases, it is a far cry from last year when a flag with the owner's name on a cabbage patch appeared to prevent theft. According to the National Statistical Office (NSO), cabbage cultivation area this fall was 13,674 ㏊, a 2,245 ha (19.6 %) increase from the previous year (11,349 ㏊). Gaeulmu's cultivation area also increased from 5,414 hectares in 2003 to 63,000 hectares in autumn. Jeong Soon-yong (57), the governor of Gyechon 2-ri, Bangnim-myeon, Pyeongchang-gun, Gangwon-do, investigated by the authorities, saying, "" Excessive production is the cause. "" However, the results on some farmers were unreliable. We can`t solve it by sitting down at an office desk instead of coming to the scene. Jeong reportedly sold cabbage every three years, until he had signed a full contract with a large company in the 35-year run. Lee Jeong-man, 52, head of the farm at Taebaek Maebongsan, said, We can not answer for a possible price hike, but we do not know what to do with it. Other landscapes have appeared that they have been grinding down the cabbage patch that they have planted with sweat. Choi Jin-seok (64), a farmer in Hongseong-gun, Chungnam Province, said, "" We grew contracts with our product stabilizers, so the situation is better. As farmers who have done business on fields with middlemen can only get about 250 to 300 won at Pogidang, they have no choice but to change their farms to avoid further losses. The government is planning to dispose of 20,000 tons of cabbages and 10,000 tons of radishes in preparation for an oversupply during the growing stage. The company said it will stabilize supply and demand by gradually isolating all excess material from the market. It will expand direct dealing with permanent markets and home shopping, and launch a kimchi campaign. Gangwon Province also held events to make kimchi with urban consumers, a Kimchi sharing event to share kimchi with Chuncheon Wholesale Market, and a Kimchi making festival to share with Gangwon Province. However, the effects of boosting consumption are uncertain. According to a survey conducted by the Rural Economic Research Institute on the demand for gimjang (kimchi made by Korean kimchi) of 718 consumers ' panels from July 19-23, only 65.3 percent of respondents said they would make kimchi themselves. As cheap imports are also likely to be aggressive, especially at large suppliers, it is widely anticipated that it will be difficult to reverse the trend of decreasing domestic cabbage consumption. Meanwhile, cabbage prices are playing every year. The average wholesale price per kilogram of cabbage was 620 won per head on September 13. The average annual price of a button is fluctuating year by 913 won in 2012, 567 won in 2013, 409 won in 2014, 436 won in 2015, 827 won last year, and 575 won this year.Every time, farmers and consumers have mixed feelings about the issue. "" It is virtually impossible to control the amount of rice collected through local maps because the supply and demand of the vegetables is not very good, "" said an official at the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation in Daejeon. "" In particular, the basic measures to replace cabbages that have long been harvested were not suggested by farmers. "" An agricultural firm said, "" Farmers can expect to raise the price of cabbage and have guaranteed to give up on the contract when the price falls, "" adding, "" We can guarantee that they will have to pay more money when the market price falls.

"Seoul Gets Cold : A cold wind from afternoon and temperatures are expected to fall. Secretary-Newspaper on November 14, 2011 : Seoul = Yonhap news, on July 14, was mostly clear throughout the country, with temperatures in excess of average year until noon. However, temperatures are expected to drop sharply at night. According to the Korea Meteorological Administration, the nation's highest temperature as of 4:20 p.m. was 9-19 degrees Celsius with one to two degrees higher than the average year (10.7 to 16.7 degrees). In particular, Gangneung recorded 14.3 degrees, up 3.9 degrees from the same time last year, and the eastern region was three degrees higher than average. The temperature is expected to drop sharply from that night. Beginning July 15, the preliminary call for the College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) in the nation's eight-grade academic year, the lowest temperature will be two to five degrees below average. The daytime highs will also be cool during the day, with temperatures dropping one to five degrees below average.

The rats wore a bell shaped mechanical device on their heads as a hat. It is an optical device that stimulates the brain of mice by firing lasers. The black rat in the rerap sniffs around. Lee Jin-hyung, a professor of biotechnology at Stanford University, pressed a button on a device connected to mice and wires. The black machine let out a blue light, and suddenly the mouse started spinning clockwise. When I set the buttons to work again, the mice danced counterclockwise this time. The laser stimulated a particular part of the brain (stristratum), which allowed the rats to move as they wished. Advanced countries are investing the money for research on a national level to study brain. In the United States, the Brain Initiative, led by DARPA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Institutes of Health, began its 5.5 trillion won project in 2013. It is said that it will draw all of the several trillion synapse that links 86 billion nerve cells. The European Union also started the Human Brain Project around the same time. In total, 135 organizations in 25 EU countries spend 1.4 trillion won to research brain science jointly. Japan has mapped its primature brains with the brain Brain Work since 2014. If we understand the human brain properly, it could lead to the evolution of scientific technology as well as the conquest of many intractable diseases, said Kim Kyung-jin, head of the Korean Institute of Brain Studies. China is also rapidly absorbing the technologies of brain engineering in developed countries in recent years. It is due to the research environment that is relatively free from regulations. Advanced countries with advanced brain engineering such as the United States and Europe have strict animal testing requirements. Because of this, the researchers of these countries have broken through the door of joint research with Chinese scientists or by local experiments. Last year, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology placed a probe into the brain and spinal cord nervous system of a paralyzed monkey, making the monkey move its legs for the first time ever. One of the authors of the study, which was published in Nature last November, is a Chinese academic institute. Italian scientists cut off the head of the monkey and transplanted it into the body of another monkey last year, which was also tested in China's Harbin University. In the process, Chinese researchers are acquiring advanced brain engineering technologies from developed countries. It is not too late to start. Starting with the Brain Research Promotion Act 1998, the Brain Frontier Business Agency was launched in 2003. It has also begun a brain research and development project that will cost 25 billion won over 10 years. In 2002, the first department of brain engineering (Bio-Electronics Research and Development) to appear at KAIST. After that, Korea Institute of Brain Research (2011), the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST), and the Institute of Basic Sciences (IBS) Research Group (2013) were launched. As a result, however, Korean brain research lags behind advanced countries. While U.S. and European companies dominate the market for brain engineering appliances and therapies, Korea has shown no products with a large impact. Some call it the ' lost 20. ' Korean researchers have published nearly 10,000 papers (9236) in the past four years. However, there are only about 18 papers that have evolved to date. Government regulations have also had a negative effect. Brain clinical tests are still lack consensus among the government, industry and academic circles, pointing out that regulatory realities were crucial for the development of Korean brain research, said Shin Chan-young, a professor at Konkuk University's School of Medicine. ▽ Secret of Brain 〓 While Korean brain research and technology development is proceeding slowly, the advanced countries of the West are moving to the market over the threshold of research laboratories. In the U.S., four companies - MetLonics and Cyberonics - dominate the global market by inserting electrodes to treat diseases or illnesses by stimulating the brain. Earlier this year, the chairman of the German medical firm, Illon Musterline, founded a bio-medical research firm called Neurelink. Neurallink aims to inject electronic networks into the brain to stimulate the nerve cells in the brain or to read out electrical signals. His ambition is to combine brain engineering with computers to create an AI era. At Facebook's annual developer conference (F8) last April, Facebook senior vice president, Li Zinahoot, declared, "" We are developing brain computing technologies that connect the human brain to the computer. "" It is also intended to demonstrate a technique to communicate directly from skin to brain without having to touch a machine like Neurellink. Of course, it is a consistent assessment by renowned brain scientists at home and abroad that it is difficult for them to achieve their goals in the next few decades. The background of the cold assessment is the ' brain '. Human beings still do not fully understand what part of the brain works. It is just enough to realize where an electrical signal is coming from. And even if they do, they need more technology to transmit electrical signals to the brain. Nevertheless, experts have called Neuralink and Facebook's idea ' valuable ' in terms of ' vision. ' This means that even though it is impossible to do so right now, if technology continues to develop, it could change the future of mankind someday. If we believe that the company produces large quantities of electric cars, we don`t believe it will become a reality, said Choi Young-sik, head of the brain research department at the Korea Institute of Brain Studies, who led the IT giant to focus on radical research.

Lee Se-won, a reporter of Yonhap News Agency (Sejong = Yonhap News Agency) : The majority of Koreans said the financial crisis in late 1997 had negative effects on Korean society by widening the income gap and increasing non-regular workers ' issues. According to a recent survey of 1,000 adults aged 19 and older conducted by the Korea Development Institute on July 14 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the foreign exchange crisis, 88.8 percent of the respondents said that the problems of the IMF's irregular workers currently affect Korea. The foreign exchange crisis has led to stable preference for jobs for government employees and teachers (86.0 %), and expanded the income gap among the people (85.6 %), which led to a stronger labor shortage (82.9 %). In addition, the survey also found that 77.9 percent of the Korean population had a poor benefit, 57.8 percent of the respondents had a decline in consumer sentiment, and 43.4 percent had a decline in the quality of life. Similar questions were raised in the statement that the foreign exchange crisis chose one negative effect on the Korean economy. First of all, 31.8 percent chose to deepen polarization, such as the income gap between the rich and the poor. 28.0 % of the respondents answered that they had to deal with unemployment, including large-scale unemployment, youth unemployment, followed by 26.3 % of non-regular workers, contract or service, and 5.6 % of the other sluggish economic growth of small businesses caused by an increase in the number of small business partners.[KDI] The positive effect of the IMF financial crisis on the economy was to increase the soundness of big businesses and financial institutions through restructuring and enhance competitiveness (245 %). In addition, the reduction in consumption culture spread (23.1 percent), the improvement of corporate management and society's overall transparency (22.7 percent), and the improvement of the global financial safety net (6.8 percent), and the flexibility of the labor market (14.4 percent) have secured the effect. 59.7 percent of the respondents said the IMF crisis negatively affected their lives at the time, with only 8.0 percent saying it had a positive effect on their lives. 32.3 percent answered that it had no effect. The rate of recognition that the IMF had negative effects on life was the highest among college students on the basis of their jobs at that time with 68.9 percent, followed by the self-employed, livestock, and fisheries workers with 67.2 percent, respectively.Then Minister of Finance and Economy Lim Chang-ryul held an emergency press conference at Gwacheon Government Complex on November 21, 1997, and announced that he would decide whether or not to ask for IMF bailout funds within 2-3 days. When asked what they experienced or felt during the IMF financial crisis (multiple choices), 64.4 percent of the respondents said it was a psychological contraction resulting from the crisis. Changes in the national view (57.5 %), changes in the employment direction and values of investment (54.9 %), changes in the home environment and in the quality of living (39.1 %), changes in the working conditions of households (39.1 %), and changes in the quality of living (49.1 %)According to a survey conducted by the Korea Institute for International Monetary Policy (IMF) on the 20th anniversary of the Asian financial crisis, the IMF is considered the most difficult time for the Korean economy in the past 50 years. 57.4 percent of the respondents picked the IMF crisis as the most difficult time, and 26.6 percent chose low-growth in the 2010. The 2008 financial crisis saw the first quarter of the world's most powerful oil market, followed by the 1970s with 5.1 percent oil crisis, 4.2 percent of the apartment price hikes in 2006, and 1.5 percent of the IT bubble burst in 2000.The first thing that comes to mind when the IMF crisis hit the Korean economy was the vote-collecting campaign, with 42.4 percent of the respondents choosing to take part. The respondents answered that they expected massive unemployment, while 17.6 percent answered that they expected bankruptcy or bankruptcy to occur to businesses such as conglomerates and banks. Some answered that they think of sovereign default, exchange rate hikes (10.8 %), and efforts to overcome crises (2.1 %) at the general level. When asked what caused the IMF financial crisis, 36.6 percent answered that they had problems with the government, including the failure to manage foreign reserves and supervise insolvent banks. 32.8 percent answered it was a system problem, such as the economic structure of the business and business ties with politicians and corruption, and 15.3 percent answered it was the responsibility of businesses, such as excessive investment and expansion of the business community. 7.9 percent of the respondents said they felt the cause of the global financial crisis and the weak global financial safety net were in the global environment, while only 6.0 percent answered that they were personally responsible for excessive consumption or real estate speculation.Among the citizens who participated in the campaign to collect gold in order to overcome the IMF's foreign exchange crisis [Yonhap news agency], 9.1 % of the organization's efforts to reform the world's financial sector, including the International Monetary Fund, and other organizations (54.4 %) selected as the driving forces behind the efforts to reduce foreign exchange burden (rescue efforts), were to collect and to reduce foreign exchange. 20 years after the foreign exchange crisis, the most important task for Korea was to boost competitiveness by creating jobs, reinforcing job security, and finding new growth engines (4th industry, etc.). On the social front, 32.7 percent of respondents said they will build trust by fighting corruption, and 32.5 percent said they will prepare measures to reduce the birthrate and aging society. Regarding the results of the survey, Lim Won-hyuk, director of the Global Economics Research Center at KDI, noted, We have found that the public's growth in unity, including the gold collecting movement, is more important than their restructuring efforts. sewonlee@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"

"" The Police Reform Committee announced its recommendation on July 14 to make the police panel more realistic of its democratic control. Although the commission was established in 1991 to ensure the political neutrality of the police and to ensure the fairness and impartiality of the public, it has failed to establish a system that would have an effective legal status, the scope of business and the exercise of authority.The reform committee will hand over the current committee of the Ministry of Public Administration and Security to the prime minister to reestablish the legal status and character of the existing police commission, and change it to a central administrative body that will have the National Police Agency as a member of the National Police Agency. The committee will have nine members, including one chairman and two permanent members, to serve as a follow-up committee to the National Assembly and its courts. This is the full committee the administration instead of the current practice of designating it as the president and legislature with the recommendation of the Minister of Public Administration and Security Commission, in the Ministry of Justice, profits to increase diversity by.And intended to enhance democracy. Through the parliamentary confirmation hearing in the ministerial attendance and a cabinet meeting and appointed by the president will be to have a voice. However, former police officer shall be excluded from the chairmanship. A former military, police, prosecutors and NIS official can not become a committee member less than three years after retirement. Park Kyung-seo, police reform committee chief, is publishing the first book of the police reform committee at Seodaemun District in Seoul on July 19 with National Police Agency Commissioner General Lee Chul-sung attending. The National Police Agency announced the establishment of a human rights violation investigation committee, the realization of the right to question lawyers, the expansion of video recordings, and the introduction of a sunset system for long-term internal investigation. The term of Chairman and Commissioners.commission`s 2017.07.19 term will be changed from the current three years to four years. Rather than banning the extension of the term to avoid unfair influence by the appointee, the president extended his term by one year to fully exercise his or her expertise. The chairman of the police commission has no right to vote to prevent political draft. Authority is also drastically empowered to perform actual management and supervision of the police. Previously, only the laws and rules belonging to the police, the deliberation and voting rights of major police policies, and the right to approve of police chief appointment were exercised. According to the recommendation, the commission will be empowered to recommend the appointment of the head of the National Police Agency and the head of the National Investigation Agency. Through the Commission's recommendation, the prime minister president appointed him to the way. The National Investigation Agency is discussing with the reform committee how to keep the police out of the investigation. The recommendation also included that the National Police Commission review and resolution of the proposed investigation proposal by the chief of police, who has served as chief of the police, and the personnel who has been appointed to the post of commissioner of police, before requesting a recommendation. As for the recommendation of the police committee to make a decision on a policy, the reform committee recommended expanding the scope of the review and resolution to major policies or business plans in addition to the law and rules related to police to deal with the issue. The authority to request for improvement or correction of systems, statutes or practices that may cause violation of human rights or the misuse of the police power, and to request for an inspection, inspection or disciplinary action against police officers involved in a scandal, or an unfair investigation by their supervisor The reform committee shall ask for the actual role of the police management institution when it shall not fulfill its duty to act as a judge under the current police law and shall request for the execution of a resolution and for securing a resolution by the police commission. Instead of strengthening the position and authority of the police committee, checks and balances will be made. It was recommended that the committee chair be required to attend the National Assembly and report to the National Assembly as a means of controlling the police committee. In addition, the reform committee recommended expanding the committee meeting to once a week to revive the committee's operations and establishing an independent office organization of appropriate size. Other recommendations included appointing expert members to assist the committee in conducting research and review in advance of the committee's agendas. However, it is not without controversy over the effectiveness of the recommendation. ▽ New Seoul = Police chief Lee Chul-seong and police chief Park Kyung-seo attended a speech on the floor of the Daecheong Police Agency in Seoul on July 16. The relocation of the National Police Agency to the office of the Prime Minister of Public Affairs at bjko@newsis.com will raise the status of an administrative agency belonging to the Prime Minister's Office, not a government committee affiliated to the Ministry of Finance and Economy, and requires a revision of the Government Organization Act. The authority of the Minister of Public Administration and Security to the National Police Agency, which is the Foreign Affairs and Security Agency, will also be lost. Police Committee appointed by the president according to the regime if the number of political neutrality, police chief is a chief of the Commission position is higher than a (vice ministerial level).Police professional independence of the damage controversy is also a concern. A member of the reform committee said, The recommendation is to change the basic frame and framework of the police. So far, in the hands of the president as commander-in-chief, determination because it is necessary to the police. "" Another committee member said, As the committee is operating on a consensus basis, I don`t think it would be too politically dependent or biased, in effect, it would have to be removed from the ordinary affairs of the former finance minister. The National Police Agency decided to accept all of the recommendations, saying that the realization of the police commission`s decision is the key to creating a democratic control system for the police and the first priority. The National Police Agency said it plans to promptly prepare and implement detailed action plans, including amendments to relevant laws, to accommodate the recommendation of the police reform committee in the future, and especially those that can be implemented without the revision of the law by this year. pjh@newsis.com> Nahansang of Okcheonsa Temple in Gosung.

The Cultural Heritage Administration announced on July 14 that it would import the Okcheonsa Nahan Prize from the U.S. auction market along with the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. The two agencies confirmed that they received a list of foreign auctions, which are regularly reviewed by the Overseas Cultural Properties Foundation, and that the stolen Okcheonsa Temple Nahan was entered. He then asked the auction house to stop selling and returned the money after months of negotiation. The return of cultural assets from overseas was carried out by collaboration with the Cultural Heritage Administration and the Seongangdang Presidence Mission of Dongakdang Shrine in Suncheon, and by the Songgwangdo Temple in Suncheon. The statue of Nahan, originally enshrined before Okcheonsa Temple in Seoul, was originally 16, but seven of them vanished in 1988. Two of the items were recovered from a private museum in 2014, and another two were displayed at the opening exhibition of the main museum and donated by the director to their home location in 2016. If the first point returns from the U.S., the uncertain Okcheonsa Temple statue will be reduced to two. The statue is a sculpture of Arahan, a man who has cut off his passions and attained the highest status among the evil spirits. Domestic people have made 16 nahan, 500 nahan to be the subject of faith. We will continue to check stolen Korean cultural assets traded abroad and push for a return, said an official at the Cultural Heritage Administration. psh59@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"I met Seo Hae-soon at the office of Without Samsam Music in Cheongdam-dong, southern Seoul on July 13. "" People don't want to hear my explanation, "" Seo said in an interview with Kyunghyang, "" but they all want to hear what they want to hear and see what they want to see. "" Lee Sang-hoon, a senior reporter at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, told police yesterday that his wife, identified by her surname Seo Hae-soon, who was recently acquitted after being sued and prosecuted over the death of Seo Gwang-seok's daughter.

""Kyunghyang Newspaper met Seo's company with Samsam Music at his office in Cheongdam-dong, southern Seoul on July 13. Next to the desk and table were photographs of Kim, a caricature, and a photo taken with her daughter Seo Yeon. When talking about her daughter Seo-yeon, she shed tears. Lee Sang-ho, who sued him for organic lethal and criminal fraud, and Kim Kwang-bok, Kim`s brother, raised his voice when he mentioned Lee Sang-ho and Kim's brother. The interview lasted for about an hour and a half.Seo said, Since the movie was released, I felt as if my heart would burst. I was on a state of depression after taking my panic disorder medication, "" said Lee Sang-ho, "" I didn't watch movies or read articles to control it. I was having a hard time holding on, '' he said. Seo said, I think I could have jumped from a higher place if I hadn't done it wrong. I could endure it without dying because I had a happy time with Seo-yeon, said Kim.Seo claimed that he was being invaded by privacy, which was too much for him to handle in daily life. Seo said, "" Which grandmother is the one who takes the elevator? ""' Here you go. I'm a bit surprised to say, `` It's my sister. '' Some people say that the only people who have known faces and names throughout the country in such a short time are Choi Soon-sil and Seo Hae-soo. As for the film's creator, reporter Lee Sang-ho said, "" To promote his film, Lee has turned someone into a complete killer who makes money. "" What a shame. How would Seo feel when he finds out that her mother had been involved in such a thing?Even now that the police have cleared him of charges, the reporter "" pretends that the truth does not sink "" and "" that it is a fighter, "" he said. "" If you don`t believe the outcome of a police investigation, what is it? Even now, he should say that he was wrong when there was something wrong with his film, and wrong when there was insufficient coverage. Seo explained strongly that he makes a lot of money with Kim Gwang-seok's album rights. In fact, many songs by Kim Kwang-seok, but not many by composition. "" I love you on the street, "" they said, "" but you know, I did. I know you sang a letter from a private private, "" and "" Around 30, "" they said, "" and they didn't all write or compose me. "" I have lived a very quiet life, without any kind of worries or interviews. In addition, they said, "" We can use sound sources for professional events such as memorial performances for Kim Gwang-seok. ""Regarding the practice of the Kim Gwang-seok Act, which significantly extends the statute of limitations in the pending cases, some lawmakers agree on the purpose of the law, "" Why should the statute of limitations of the existing law be extended? "" It is not polite to the dead. We plan to organize our businesses and establish and manage a side-founding office when we get older, said Seo, who also intends to donate to the Kabuki syndrome group for Seo Yeon. Seo Hae-soon checks a copyright suit filed with lawyer Park Hoon at the "" Without Samsam Music "" office in Cheongdam-dong, southern Seoul, Wednesday. Lee Sang-hoon, a senior reporter at doolee@kyunghyang.com and Seo Hae-soon are the only ones who answered the question. - There was also a lot of public criticism after Lee Sang-ho's film < Kim Gwang-seok > was released. It hurt me like a ton of bricks. She took anti-crurnal medication and overlapped with menopause, leading to depression. To control the situation, I did not watch any movie by Lee Sang-ho or listen to the article. I was having a hard time holding myself back. If you were wrong, you might have jumped from a high altitude. Fortunately, the house I live in now was where I lived with Seo Yeon. I go out when I feel frustrated because I have a terrace and yard. Seo-yeon's items were still around, and I remember swimming and barbecuing. Because I had a happy time with Seo-yeon, I was able to endure it without dying. "" - Although the police announced that they were innocent, many people still thought it was strange.We have explained many times about those suspicions, but people don`t want to hear them. He listens to what he wants to hear ; he sees what he wants to see. The panels of the clan program that dealt with the incident do not speak out clearly. A normal house is not hidden from your daughter when she is wrong. Everyone is sad and has a funeral normally. But I was alone. She had a hard time raising Seo by herself. There was no one to look after. Seo-yeon never took anyone from the house to cook rice or let Seo-yeon discuss tuition. I asked Seo-yeon to call her grandmother after she was abroad, but there was no word like ' Come here, Seo-yeon. ' But the people say different things. (※ Kim Kwang-seok's brother, Kim Kwang-bok, told Yonhap News Agency last month that Seo-yeon called her directly and she should have stopped talking with her grandmother. 'I called Seo-yeon. Seo-yeon is here in Korea, "" he said. So how much hatred it must have been. Those who did not visit Seo-yeon so much deserve to say that Seo-yeon is wrong now. I didn't call you because I hated everything. That was my mind. I felt sorry not to have told the mothers of Dongbaek Middle School's Jangpae School, the closest, on the evening of July 13 at the "" With Sam Sam Music "" office in Cheongdam-dong, Seoul. "" People don't want to hear my explanation, "" Seo said in an interview with Kyunghyang, "" but they all want to hear what they want to hear and see what they want to see. "" Do you think it is witch hunt?"" Lee Sang-ho made a perfect killer out of money to promote his film. After raising suspicion of murder and mobilizing members of the National Assembly, I had to be brutally attacked. What a bloody affair that is! Would Kim Gwang-seok want his wife to be treated like such a dirty woman, falsely accused of murder? How would Seo feel if she knew that her mother had been attacked? How much tears I will shed! I fell asleep trying to figure out what to do with the movie [Kim Gwang-seok]. I felt as if Seo was holding my hand while asleep. Then this happened.(Shedding) Ah, you gave her a message. Mom, this is hard work, so bear with me. When I die, it's the perfect story. It seems that everybody wants it. Lee Sang-ho, I think society is driving him like that. "" Which grandmother said, ' Seo Hae Soon?' Here you go. I said, ' It's my sister ' in surprise. I can't go anywhere. People know their faces and names correctly. Some people say that only Choi Soon-sil and Seo Hae-soon are known for their faces and names in such a short time. I will draw up a lawsuit against the woman I was accused of meeting with. Lee Sang-ho, who is not even an entertainer, or an ordinary "" ajumma, "" was almost stalking me. He said he digs into it as if he were Kim Kwang-seok's brother. Even now, when the police have cleared him of all charges, they still pretend to be fighters, saying, ' The truth does not sink. ' What do they believe if they don't believe the results of police investigations? It is time to say that if there is something wrong with his or her film, she did it wrong, and if there was not enough coverage, it was insufficient. You can not be a good man or a good journalist unless you agree. Kim Kwang-bok also said, "" I should have known the copyright agreement and the lawsuit in the past, and I was accusing Lee of not being guilty of litigation. """" I was so angry when I was being questioned that I could make hundreds of movies by making them the way Lee did. "" I also have a director and a PD. It won't cost much to make. It is not natural that we should pursue a movie about Lee Sang-ho.Lee Sang-ho also writes pictures of my face on a video he has made. I took all of your pictures in New York. If you tell me this, I keep saying that I keep asking for money, but I run a company. I'm not a public figure. If you use my face picture anywhere, you can object. - Kim's acquaintances are calling for Kim`s copyright to be released on a public level.I have never blocked it so badly. Kim Gwang-seok, the producer of the song, can be used as a venue for a performance to establish the Kim Gwang-seok Scholarship Foundation and a memorial performance by fan clubs. However, when signing a contract with the musical "" Discover, "" Kim asked me to let him write all of his songs. Later, Kim Kwang-seok, who also wanted to write in the musical "" Days, "" contracted with Dissmber, and said it was a bit difficult. However, not many songs by Kim Gwang-seok were composed by him. "" Wait on the Street, "" "" I Love You, "" "" Private Letter, "" and "" Around 30, "" were sung by Kim Kwang-seok, but did not compose or write songs. So when you make a play out of these songs, it becomes a musical. Even though I don't have any songs by Kim Kwang-seok,"
"Musical with a Singing ' is promoted as follows. It is not a matter of any law. In such a situation, what kind of legal response would I take? People think I take everything because I don't talk. Copyright income was now one hundred million a year, but was originally three to five million won. The recent remake of "" Where the Wind Is blowing "" has helped boost copyright revenue. Until now, I have lived alone and never interviewed or been alone. Some say it is not better than Seo's absence.I think the law is a good idea. I agree with the intention of the law to increase the prescription of the existing Tae-wan Act. However, I hope you don't write Kim Kwang-seok's name on the law. It is not polite to the dead. I haven't told you yet about Kim Gwang-seok's method, but I will. How can the nation go back if they make a petition? "" (A day after the interview, Seo's lawyer Park Hoon said on the morning of July 14, "" We plan to review Seo's petition by saying that it was a homicide attempt.I met Seo Hae-soon at the office of Without Samsam Music in Cheongdam-dong, southern Seoul on July 13. "" People don't want to hear my explanation, "" Seo said in an interview with Kyunghyang, "" but they all want to hear what they want to hear and see what they want to see. "" | Lee Sang-hoon, senior reporter Doolee @ngghyang.com - Until recently, he worked in Daegu, where Kim Kwang-seok's hometown was founded, creating ' Kim Gwang-seok Storythouse. 'The Kim Kwang-seok Storehouse in Daegu opened in July this year. I found a house in Jung-gu, Daegu. It was similar to Seogyo-dong's house where I used to live. The yard was really pretty. Seogyo-dong House was built to build the building, but later on, I thought I should have lived with Seo-yeon in the yard instead of the building. Storehouse had a small courtyard to let him live with a bit of a seorhouse. The Storehouse displayed the sofas, chairs, tables, clocks, and other items that Kim really wrote, and gave fans a free look. There are pictures of Seo Yeon. Seo-yeon did a photo of her family in memory. In fact, since people close to Seo-yeon were curious about her, and since I kept telling lies unintentionally, Seo-yeon felt it was time to tell her stories (while preparing for them).The plan is to go ahead. "" As I'm old, I want to close down some businesses and leave a slice of the pie to Seo Yeon. There may be a way to donate the money to a foundation related to Kabuki's syndrome. As many people are involved in the incident, Kim Kwang-seok can join us if agreed. As Daegu is planning to establish a division corporation (Kim Gwang-seok Foundation for Happiness Sharing), they are considering ways to manage it together. However, when a division or foundation is created, it is problematic to go to the wrong person's rights after the generations. I think it is right that the closest person has it. In addition, the Appeals Commission should increase the quorum of the decision to require an agreement on more than two-thirds of the members present to reduce the severity of the measure, including the dismissal and dismissal of government employees. The Personnel Innovation Agency announced on July 14 that it will announce a revision to the National Public Officials Act on July 15 with such a slogan in mind.Article 57 of the National Civil Service Act stipulates that ' civil servants must obey their supervisor's instructions on official duty. ' The revision added a clue to this clause, ' However, if the order of the superior is clearly illegitimate, it can not raise an objection or follow, and thus should not incur any personal disadvantage. ' If an unfair personnel measure is taken for refusal to fulfill, it is allowed to ask for help by requesting counseling on complaints or examination, as well as by requesting review of grievances. When a complaint was requested, the committee held a grievance review committee, which included a private member, to ensure fair examination. Kim Pan-seok, head of the personnel office, said, I believe that the government's push to follow one of its orders while knowing that it is illegal because of personal penalties and other concerns. The Board of Audit and Inspection previously announced its audit results on the alleged involvement by the government authorities, including Choi Soon-sil, and pointed out the problems in the public office's social atmosphere that were carried out without a review of violation of the statutes. The investigation office will also strengthen the review process of civil servants who have been criticized as "" examination of the inspection period "" through the revision. In the event that the review of a disposition made by the Central Administrative Service by the disciplinary committee shall be governed by the Central Committee of the Prime Minister's Office, and that the presence of a majority punishment such as dismissal or dismissal shall be canceled or changed from the current Committee ; In addition, to improve the discriminatory factors in public office, the government will revise the regulation to allow the temporary retirement of childcare to be used freely. Currently, the term of the maternity leave is more than six months before the maternity leave is allowed, but if the revision is passed, the remaining term of the term will be allowed. The new rules also prohibit discrimination by gender, religion and social status when hiring government employees without good reason. The Act provided that anyone who is exposed of illegal or unfair personnel management practices, such as recruitment or promotion of government employees, should be able to report to the Personnel Office and that legal grounds are established to prevent any disadvantage to whistleblowers. The head of the personnel shall take proper corrective actions, such as requesting for disciplinary action, when necessary, by conducting a personnel audit on a tip. If the fact that the results of an audit are found to be a serious violation or unjust fact, and the reason of the occurrence is the head of the administrative body, the head of the National Assembly will be able to notify the relevant bodies of the revision to appoint or recommend the appointment. In addition, the Office of Personnel Management has extended its scope to utilize the national human resource database as an advisory database for experts in policy development, and has actively provided information such as information that government employees can directly access and read from the database. noanoa@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"The cost of car and office is also deducted from actual reals…the tax payment ordinance per per…Don't let the inspector charge the ` excessive tax payment ` and the ` under-the-table market ` pay. The number 38 was derived from Article 38 of the Constitution, which says all citizens are liable to pay taxes. The ministry received attention in July when the father of a professional golfer named Yoo So-yeon paid 300 million won in local tax in full for his 16-year overdue payment. The recruiting department has 25 delinquent passers[employees]. Six of them are contract workers. As the tax collection is highly intensive, such as being threatened by a delinquent debtor, the average civil servant avoids it. Employees who work at private debt collection agencies are hired on a contract basis.◇ Unfair protest, 朴 mayor "" do not pay one day's fee, "" contract workers are subject to the Seoul city government's "" Act on the Payment of Recovered Taxes on Income "". However, the ordinance includes the rent of the office building, the City Hall, and the cost of working as a team manager of a city government office. Even though the government employees are hired according to local government law, they work as self-employed at the cost of renting cars and office.Six contract workers receive a reward of 14 million won per annum and 3 to 7 percent of the amount collected. The basic deduction for each person is 141 million won. It includes 16 million won for the cost of one head of the disciplinary department. The city also has to pay 500,000 won for the office rental fee, 2.4 million won for the car rental fee, 900,000 won for the oil flow fee, and 200,000 won for the car tax and insurance. No offices or vehicles and management personnel will be set up for the six contract workers. Even when using the same office and car as the average employee, contract deductions include operating expenses. If the amount of individual collection does not meet the basic monthly deduction of 11.75 million won, the collection will be carried forward to be deducted. A city official said, If there is anything unreasonable, I will ask for a legal revision, saying, I will stop paying excessive rewards as a result, and put a deduction item to use as the amount of money as the city's financial resources.The posting for hiring contract employees does not appear. It only says that it will hire people who have an appointment system based on the local government employees ` law and the local government employees ` appointment ordinance. The contract says, ' We will pay a collection reward in accordance with the ordinance on the payment of tax collection and collection fees by the Seoul Metropolitan Government. ' The amount of deduction is not specified.A researcher who has worked as a contract worker for the 10-year-long ministry recently posted a complaint about the unfairness of the ordinance on its city administration portal Won Soon's complaint center. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon's office is the place to answer complaints filed by civil servants. We are operating with a higher rate of reward and upper limit of payment compared to regular employees, according to the special provisions, said Park, responding to the investigator. "" It is called the Sarangjima, the branch of life. Please do not be surprised at the immediate result and try to get a bigger one. "" I asked you to dig out the injustice of the ordinance, and I was embarrassed to answer it, "" the investigator said. "" I felt as if I was working with pride for the past 10 years. ""◇ It is also disclosed that some of the payment amount collected by the reward collector goes to the reward of the employee who does not conduct the onsite collection. According to a report recently submitted by Seoul Metropolitan Government to Seoul Metropolitan Office of Representatives and Eunpyeong District to Lee Soon-ja, the administrative, technical, and administrative, which does not distribute any substantial amount of money, is not collected. Rep. Lee Soon-ja points out, We need to come up with fundamental improvements to increase transparency and fairness. A 38 tax collector said, All of the department employees receive a reward because they have difficulty collecting their arrears of taxes. ▽ Photo = It is not surprising that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on July 14 stressed ` aggressive restructuring ` toward the Korean economy. Restructuring is the economy's age-old task. But there is a reason why it hasn't been easy for a long time. Because waving a structure usually involves resistance. Examples are labor market reform, such as the mitigation of protection of regular workers, and commodity market reform, such as the relaxation of various investment and entry regulations.So, recent economic circles point out that the recovery phase is "" golden hour "" of structural reform. If the job market is hit hard, it could accelerate the pace of recession. That means that if the government reconfigures the structure in a dead-end street, as it did in the past during the foreign exchange crisis, the aftermath will double. The IMF stressed its mid - to long-term restructuring plan, but raised the growth rate to 3.2 percent this year, which is not irrelevant. When IdalI met, economic experts agreed. In particular, he focused on the expansion of labor flexibility toward full-time workers, as pointed out by the IMF.◇ Measurement “The economy is when I need structural reforms” an economics professor gimgyeongsu a Sungkyunkwan University, an economics professor, "" the next South Korean government could be a problem, but lacks labor flexibility in the future.The height is the most important issue of our economy "" “Moon Jae-in the president vowed to temporary abolition of the problem is that full-time nanny as long as it continues in trouble.” that high.Said.Professor Kim argues that if we are to eliminate discrimination between regular and non-regular workers, we should first ease the protection of rigid full-time jobs. It is desirable to solve the restructuring of traditional industries, such as shipbuilding and construction, when the economy is doing as well as it is now, Kim advised, even in areas that are less competitive among export related industries such as steel.Last year, former president of the Korean economics department Cho Jang-ok, also said, It is very important that the restructuring be difficult and therefore less damaging. The government should have a lot of will.This is similar to the ' flexibility ' concept presented by the IMF today. Expand flexibility for the Gaepa full-time position In addition, build a social safety net for the unemployed or establish a social safety net for the active labor market policies. The demand for technological and structural changes resulting from the fourth industrial revolution will form a new labor market structure, the IMF added.Ju Won, director of the economics research department at Hyundai Economic Research Institute, similarly thought. He has first hand of the structural reform to raise the labor flexibility, but Moon Jae-in, while the story that is not a place in the government. It is the government's idea to be rigid. We agree that it is the right time to reform the structure, said Shin Min-young, an economist at LG Economic Research Institute.There were also many advice on easing regulations. Yonsei University economics professor Kim Jung-sik said, "" Because of the high wages of regular workers and the difficulty being laid off, restructuring is not really easy. In reality, the only breakthrough is to see an improvement in corporate income, "" adding, "" It is not an easy way to live up to the corporate issues.◇ The problem of "" next year's economy is likely to be slower than this year "" is that it is unknown how long the rebound will continue. That means if we miss Golden Time now, we may face more painful restructuring.Experts don't think next year's games will be very bright. Exports and investment were good overall, but the most important thing is consumption this year, said Shin Min-young, who heads the ministry to discuss the issue this year. He expects next year's growth rate to be in the mid-two-percent range. Professor Kim Jung-sik also said, Citing the United States and other austerity measures, I think the growth rate will be lower than this year.It is clear that the global economy is in harmony with the economic recovery. It is likely to get better by next year, but we may have difficulties with the possibility of ` new three high schools ` recently emerging from some quarters. If the recent rise in the Korean won, oil prices, and interest rates become a reality with the new three, it could put a burden on our economy.

Yoo, who rose from the dock, bowed low to the court and said, After being detained, I am spending every day with deep reflection and atonement.

If the past three decades have been a loyal life for the nation, I will live a life of serving society in the future, the court urged the court to give a favorable answer. Yoo admitted all of the crimes and agreed to the evidence submitted by the prosecution. The court concluded the trial on the same day after examining the composite picture of the problem in a physical camera. The prosecution just said, The defendant has given a lot of cooperation to the prosecution's investigation so far, but there is something to be done in the future. It is difficult to continue investigating when judgment is made, and we can expect additional charges, so please defer it.

After watching the Korean Professional Baseball playoffs, he watched the highlights on cable channels. It was the actual day of the day last month for local officials who entered the "" merit training "" earlier this year.Moon Jae-in, the government has 11 trillion won from next year's budget proposal of the restructuring of government expenditures. One of the key ways to finance the presidential election pledges is to restructure spending and tighten the belts between ministries. However, the amount of money spent on training government employees is actually no touch.Park Chan-dae, a fisherman's representative at the National Policy Committee, received an annual salary of 1,582 government employees last year as part of his 2012-2016 national and local government service training program. The figure is about 46.26 million won per person, excluding various benefits. The budget alone amounted to 62 billion won over the past three years. The merit system was introduced to help civil servants who have less than one year left until retirement age adjust to society. It was first introduced to public servants with a grade 5 or higher in 1990 and expanded to civil servants with a grade 6 or lower in 1993.

"" Critics point out that the government is wasting taxpayers ' money using the training program to solve the congestion of human resources. Whether citizens can agree on such a system is questionable, Park said, It is better to scrap the system unless we effectively change the merit training in line with the aging era.Some worry that if the government does not improve the public service education system while promoting the creation of 810,000 public jobs, only the number of non-working employees will increase. It is difficult to get rid of the program because it is so complicated with other personnel systems, said an official at the personnel reform ministry."

First of all, why didn't the South Korean military fire back? If you think about it, the North Korean military will shoot you, so you should shoot too. I think that's the argument. [reporter] That's right. However, it is not right to say that the North Korean military shot us, considering the special nature of the JSA. The site commander will determine the situation as a whole to whether to fire back or not, and first you need to see if there is a breach of the ceasefire.The North Korean army after getting off the car ran over the border, and if there was a shooting incident after it crossed the border, it would have violated the armistice agreement. [Anchor] But it would be hard to judge it because it's too short.[reporter] That's right. Let's see what happened then. It's about 10 meters from the car to the Military Demarcation Line. Since the North Korean army crossed the border was about 50 meters, it is possible that the shooting occurred even after the fleeing North Korean soldier stepped on our side.That would violate the ceasefire agreement.But as you said, because it was only a few seconds, and the shootings didn't last long, we need an extra investigation.[Anchor] 40 shots are automatically left to shoot, and when you shoot, it will slurp off at a time, so it was not a long shot. But then the North Korean army operated on an AK-47 was actually supposed to be with the gun. Within the truce village of Panmunjeom So isn't this a violation of the ceasefire agreement?Carrying a rifle in the JSA is a breach of armistice agreement.It was not clear whether the North Korean soldiers in the guard post fired the rifles, which were carried out, or whether the North Korean soldiers who were chasing the North Korean soldiers out of the JSA were firing their shots.The soldiers deployed near the JSA anyway are armed with rifles. ANGER : Don't you think it's easy to check with a CCTV or something?[Video] There is another blind spot, and since the part that follows is off the Military Demarcation Line in our JSA, you need to check it out more. Anchors : It happened in a few moments, so it seems like there are many controversies, and what is the position of our military forces?Defense Minister Song Young-moo said, "" First of all, I judged it in a short time, and then I did a good job of not raising the situation.

But you don't just fire at random because it's a shooting, you have conditions.[reporter] That's right. The basic framework of the UNC rules is to respond proportionally to any threat to the Korean military, whether or not it is highly probable that it will pose a threat.If the commander of the scene judged that the North Korean bullet was not a shot at our sentry, and that it was highly probable that it would be a counterattack, he would not have counterattacked.The Site commander's judgment is so important.

"▽ Money-Traday Kim Se-gwan : [KT M. Mobile and other transfer businesses are also having a hard time managing 600 thousand wool rental units.] Home Plus decided to withdraw from its frugal phone business this month. Another conservative mobile phone operator, which has more than 600,000 subscribers, was recently confirmed to be suffering from financial problems. Amid negative domestic and international environment surrounding the saving phone industry, such as an upward revision of the alternative pricing schedule, monthly fee reduction of 11,000 won per month for the underprivileged and a full review on the introduction of the universal rate system, the savings phone industry is facing a possible shutdown. ◇ Home Plus Saverphone Stops Service Experience…Because of Changes in the External Environment = According to the government and industry on July 13, Home Plus is scheduled to end its frugal phone service on July 30. With the announcement in mind, Home Plus is undergoing a full-scale closing process by receiving the consent of its thrifty phone subscribers to transfer to a third-party service. Home Plus entered the frugal phone market in March 2013. In those days, it received attention due to its combination of large discount stores and economical phones. However, it has discussed with the Science and Technology Information Ministry (Ministry of Science and Technology and Information) since late last year to withdraw its business, in conjunction with the issue of expanding subscribers and selling companies in 2015. In the past year, no new subscribers were actually sought. Currently, approximately 10,000 residuary-sized Home Plus consumers are estimated to have paid for their own phones. I usually rent KT network, and some use LG U + network. Among customers who agree to transfer their services, KT network users will automatically switch to KT Emmobile, a subsidiary of KT Freetel Co., and LG U-Plus Network users will automatically be transferred to MedioClog, a subsidiary of LG U-Plus Co. We are in the process of agreeing with our subscribers on the transfer of services, said a Homeplus official. If subscribers agree to transfer to other saving phone operators, the numbers and rates will be automatically switched on December 1. Those who can not contact the company by July 25 will be suspended from office starting July 27, and services will be terminated sequentially. ◇ Business suspension worries … `` Reflecting difficulties in the industry '' or "" market reformation "" = The problem is that the withdrawal of saving phones is not the only problem for Home Plus. Last month, consumers experienced considerable inconvenience due to financial difficulties in customer centers. Some worry that the domino effect may arise. The industry agrees that the situation represents the difficult environment of the economy and the mobile phone market. Although it was adopted with an ambition to realize the ' half-price ' communications costs in 2011, it took more than six years to face structural limitations. It was not without the government and businesses ' efforts. As the government has continued to make efforts to reduce wholesale price by replacing the deposit phone, such as to negotiate a bargaining fee, to exempt the use of radio waves, the postal service, and sales of saving phones by saving money, the business community has secured various mobile service providers (and handset companies) that can provide tens of billions of won per year.However, the industry profitability has worsened as the competition for the saving-providing mobile phone service has intensified due to changes in the external market environment such as the launch of the 30,000 won data plan. In particular, since the inauguration of the new government, companies have reportedly adopted a policy of reducing communication costs by adjusting the discount rate of the drug discount, reducing the monthly rate of communication to the weak, and reviewing the adoption of the universal rate system. The industry may feel inadequate, but we are not making efforts to revive the industry this year by cutting wholesale prices and extending the exemption of radio fees, said an official at the ministry. Some say that this is part of the natural market reformation. Since the introduction of the frugal phones in 2011, there has never been a market reorganization, and now it is time to start the business only with operators who can do business. "" It can be not only an intelligent investment sector, it can be an IoT field, "" an industry insider said.

"Countermove fire also needs UNC approval ... The Joint Security Area is where a U.S. battalion commander counteracted by Kim GwI-geun (Yonhap news agency) at the Joint Security Area of the United Nations Command (Joint News Agency) and escaped from the truce village. The South Korean military has been in charge of guarding the DMZ since 2004, but the use of force, such as countersuit fire, must be approved by the United Nations Command. There are two main generals : the Korean Army Security Unit and the United Nations Security Command (UNC), all of which are lieutenant colonel. Korean troops are responsible for the expense, but the use of force is where the complicated chain of command that has to be controlled by the U.S. Army's battalion commander operates. Military officials explain that the command structure is necessary because the UNC has the jurisdiction of the DMZ under the armistice agreement. If a counteroffensive is to be fired within the JAS, it is necessary to follow the UNC engagement rules. However, the UNC's rules of engagement should respond with the principle of proportionality, with an exact assessment of the possibility of a war being confirmed and the escalating crisis management. Seo Wook, director of operations at the National Assembly`s National Defense Committee, said, The rules on engagement at the Joint Chiefs of Staff consists of two tracks. "" We will determine at the same time whether the situation is causing harm to the sentry or whether the crisis will escalate. "" The Joint Chiefs of Staff explained, As the Joint Chiefs of Staff is in charge of UNC's responsibility, it is the commander of the United Nations Command at the central bank, which explains, All of which must be controlled by the United Nations Command chief. Korea`s military guideline to engage in a frontal attack is to respond immediately, using the commander's method of being a candidate for the position, and to fire back at the scene without limiting proportion to fire. However, an official of the JCS stated, "" If there is a direct risk of harm to the Korean soldiers, the commander of Korean troops at the scene can exercise his right to defend himself. "" "" It is based on the judgment of the field commander whether or not we exercise our right to defend ourselves rather than what we can do or not in the JSA, "" he said, protecting the Korean troops at the scene by UNC power rules. Some in the military argue that since the South Korean military is in charge of the defense, the UN commander should delegate the decision to use the armed forces and exercise its right to defend the defense to the commander of the Korean battalion.Kim To-il, a reporter at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed on July 13 that North Korean soldiers who defected via the truce village of Panmunjeom approached the North's outpost by military jeep.The reason for this is that the site of kmtoil@yna.co.kr is in an urgent situation, and if the UNC rules of engagement and the UNC decides the situation and waits for the instruction, it can not respond to the crisis. The U.S. side has expressed considerable dissatisfaction with the aggressive engagement guidelines of the Korean military in the area of the general outpost, making it difficult to assign troops to the chief of the Korean armed forces. Meanwhile, some point out that with the recent defection, the South should increase its surveillance equipment in the JSA with a clear view. It is known that the area where North Korean soldiers were shot down was the blind spot on CC (Circuit Closed) TV. Surveillance equipment was installed at several points in the JSA, which is mostly headed to the north and is said to have concentrated on major possible infiltration. threek@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
