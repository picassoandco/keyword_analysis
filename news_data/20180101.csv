While the issuance of new virtual accounts, the basis for virtual currency transactions, is fully prohibited, it takes up to a month for a real-name bank system to be adopted at commercial banks. The photo shows the Bitsum Exchange in central Seoul in the morning. mon@yna.co.kr, a traditional virtual account holder can do business (Seoul = Yonhap news) ; Park Yong-ju, a reporter of New Year's news agency, will virtually enter the market to block the virtual currency (cipher currency) on January 1. While the issuance of new virtual accounts, the basis for virtual currency transactions, is fully prohibited, it takes up to a month for a real-name bank system to be adopted at commercial banks. According to the financial authorities on July 1, the Financial Services Commission held a "" virtual money-related financial institutions inspection meeting "" on July 28 with Financial Supervisory Service and commercial bank officials to discuss follow-up measures against the government. The Financial Services Commission requested at the meeting that the bank first stop issuing new virtual accounts to virtual currency traders (exchanges) and offering virtual accounts to new members of existing virtual account dealers. This will block the entry into the virtual currency market. A full interruption of the new issuance of virtual accounts on the current system, where virtual currency transactions are required using virtual accounts, means that the opening of new transactions will eventually stop, said an official at the financial authorities. New members can continue to sign up as a new member depending on the policies of the virtual currency exchange, but new transactions are also not possible as the virtual account is stopped. As for the virtual account of Kim Yong-beom, vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission for Virtual Monetary Policy, the virtual account is used to identify individual customer transactions (individual corporate accounts) when a large amount of deposits or transfers are granted from banks. As individual virtual accounts are issued and controlled by businesses rather than banks, it is pointed out that they are a hotbed of indiscriminate transactions as there is no real name verification procedure. Financial authorities said the first person to deal with virtual currencies for the future is to use the ' real-name bank transaction service. ' This service allows you to deposit only in the account of the identified operator and the same bank account of the virtual currency handler. Financial authorities, however, expect banks to spend one to two weeks to adopt the system, at the latest, and one to a month to do so. Banks need to draw out unified criteria, and there are times when it will take physically to transfer those criteria into computer systems. Authorities plan to launch a task force early this month to engage the Financial Services Commission, the Financial Supervisory Service, and the commercial bank in order to speed up the time to introduce the real-name bank service. The financial industry expects the real-name bank system to be fully operational before and after July 20. Those who received virtual accounts before January 1 are able to make virtual currency transactions as before. As virtual accounts are not a clear personal name, it is advantageous to check their real names, said an official at the financial watchdog, even the incumbent dealers should go through the real-name process as soon as possible. speed@yna.co.kr According to CNN on July 1, the pope's order to print on the holiday cards was photographed by a boy in Nagasaki, Japan, who was hit by an atomic bomb by U.S. forces in 1945.Photo of an Atomic Bombs on Pope's New Year's Card by U.S. Marine Corps photographer Joe O'Donnell, photographed publicly available at Nagasaki, Japan, in 1945.A boy with a dead brother is shown standing in front of the crematorium, waiting for the order of the funeral. On the back of the card, the picture was explained with the title ' The result of the war. ' The Pope left his signature under the title. Local media reported that the pope himself chose the photo. The caption read, The little boy's sorrow appears only when he bites the bloody lips.The photo was taken by Cho O'Donnell, a photographer at the U.S. Marine Corps who visited the scene after dropping an atomic bomb during World War II. U.S. Congressional Library of State for the Day of the War says the aftermath of the attacks on Nagasaki and Hiroshima by U.S. forces on two cities was recorded as the result of nuclear weapons. The photos of Odonal were revealed in a book titled "" Japan 1945 : A Marine photographer from Ground Zero. "" CNN's Vatican commentator John Allen says, "" There is no significant new addition to the pope's stance on photo cards, but the pope himself has chosen the first specific image to be released during the holidays. "" The pope has previously criticized nuclear weapons and was very concerned about the harm war would have on children. Some say that the North might have carried out its nuclear weapons program or raised tension on the Korean Peninsula due to the U.S. and other military options. In a Christmas message posted on July 25 (Rome and the rest of the world), the Pope separately urged people to trust him, concerned about the standoff on the Korean Peninsula. The Pope also revealed last November that he `` prayed daily '' to resolve the crisis surrounding the Korean Peninsula. Reuters reported that the Pope's New Year message also warned of irresponsible behavior. "" We wasted and ruined the year with death, lies and injustice, "" the Pope told a year-end mass held at St. Peter's Basilica the previous day. Pope Francis [AFP] who prayed for the war was "" the most glaring sign of shameless, foolish arrogance, and many crimes called it a sign of humanity, society and the environment. "" Pope Francis did not disclose specifically what theories were involved in, but stressed responsibility. "" We have to take responsibility for everything before God, our brothers and our creatures, "" the Pope said. Throughout 2017, he has made a strong voice in many global issues, including wars, racism and climate change. The Pope denounced as an "" unacceptable massacre "" after a chemical attack in Syria in April last year killed many civilians.

The average Korean man who spends more time exercising a week was 295 minutes, which is 95 minutes longer than the Japanese one (200).Physical fitness age was the opposite of exercise. According to a recent survey, Japanese elderly people were found to have less exercise than their Korean counterparts in terms of time and time needed to balance on one foot, stretch their arms functionally, and rise from a chair. Even though the BMI was established, Korean elderly people were heavier than Japanese elderly. The research team estimated that Korean elderly people are 3.7 years older than Japanese under the same conditions of physical function.The researchers attributed the age difference between Korean and Japanese elderly people's physical abilities to their different exercise habits. Korean elderly people enjoyed walking, mountain climbing, and biking, but Japanese elderly people concentrated on sports classes, ball sports, and water sports. Korean elderly people often hike on the mountain is very athletic, but it is hard to tell whether it is for exercise or for social purposes, some say.It is desirable for Korean seniors to practice more exercise to improve their fitness, along with the exercise habits they are currently practicing, Chung Song-yi recommends.The results of the study were published in the online edition of the International Geriatrics & Gerontology.[reporter Kim Myeong-jin @chosun.com][ Go to Dooson.com] - Copirits ⓒ Chosun Ilbo & chosun.com, No Japoff and Redistribute -"

"Science Issue to Surprise World : Black Hole Contours in Black early March. / NASA, Google, and others have various scientific issues that will shock the world this year. What happened in science fiction films such as "" black hole observation "" and "" gene therapy "" is about to become reality.First of all, it is possible to see the face of a black hole that has not been able to observe its reality. A black hole is a state of extreme contraction of a very massive star. The gravitational pull was so strong that it took in not only material and light that it was unable to observe the actual appearance. International Joint Research Team Korea, the United States and Europe found the black hole in the constellation Archer, which is the center of the Milky Way last April. The international team began verifying the black hole observations collected by eight radio telescopes simultaneously last summer. As a result, the outline of the black hole will be revealed for the first time as early as this year. The U.S. space agency NASA is also planning to launch TESS (Tess), an alien planet observatory in March. The satellite with a space telescope will observe about 200,000 exoplanets over the next two years.The United States and Europe are planning to apply ' crisper gene scissors ' to people for the first time this year. Crisper gene scissors are protein enzymes that cut bad genes that cause diseases in DNA. Last year, a joint U.S. team of scientists successfully eliminated gene for genetic diseases from human embryos (fertilized eggs). Genetic therapy company Krisperterapteraphatics is using Krisper's gene scissors for genetic blood disease patients in Europe and the United States this year. Stanford University School of Medicine is also planning to ask the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to allow patients with blood diseases to conduct clinical tests on gene scissors.There are also quantum computers that can significantly exceed the performance of supercomputers. Google plans to launch a quasI-computer computer with a 50-quit performance within this year. A bit, the unit of information used by an existing computer, expresses information as either 0 or 1. The cubite of the quantum computer is much faster to compute because it can process zero and one at the same time. As quivits grow more exponentially, the speed of a quantum computer can outpace a traditional supercomputer. In Korea, a test rocket launch is scheduled in October to check the performance of a 75-ton Korean rocket engine. This is what it looked like when I went out in the morning after the New Year events last night, said residents of the apartment building.

"As punishment is not enough to curb the extreme neglect of human beings, the prosecution has decided to draw up a concrete standard of the amount of criminal offenses committed by each case, and will start to prosecute those convicted of murder starting next year. Murder, combined with violent crimes such as rape and kidnapping of minors, is based on life imprisonment. In the event of extreme neglect of human beings, the death penalty will be actively considered. The Supreme Public Prosecutors ` Office said yesterday that it will start streamlining guidelines on how to deal with murder cases. The main reason is that the total amount of capital punishment for murder was raised and the criteria of the offense were divided into case by case. We intend to alert the murder crimes with a strict, unified law enforcement law enforcement law enforcement law and present clear opinions to the courts that will pass sentence, the prosecution explained. The sentences that the courts proclaim of murder vary greatly from probation to death. The reason for punishment varies from crime to crime. After setting the first standard for murder in 2009, the committee revised the standard for judgment of the law twice in 2011 and 2013. However, the current punishment level is not sufficient to curb murder against women, children and the underprivileged. In a survey conducted by the Kookmin Ilbo with the Supreme Public Prosecutors ' Office (see June 5, 2017), eight out of 10 Koreans answered that the standard of assessment in terms of homicide crimes and the type of law were low. In addition to the prosecution (51.8 percent), lawyers and half of the teaching group said they "" had a low punishment rate. "" Under the new standard, the prosecution will punish women and children more severely on socially disadvantaged people, including the elderly and disabled. People who seek financial gains, revenge, or "" don't ask "" murder consider it as an additional punishment factor. Homology and violence are also an added factor. However, victims who have been murdered, such as those who have abused their perpetrators, also consider crimes that they have reasons for themselves or that are caused by their hardships, as an anxiety factor. Prosecutors estimate that about 50 victims lose their innocent lives each year due to ex-offenders. Murder cases occur in the region of 1000 per year, with the average rate of offenders being convicted of murder as ex-convicts from 2006 to 10 years old recorded 6 percent. The prosecution said, "" Punishing a murder case strongly not only restrains it, but also isolates an ex-convict from society longer. "" Our courts usually carry a sentence of murder for 10 to 16 years. In Germany, 24.3 percent of murderers were sentenced to life in jail for five years starting 2010.

I'm afraid it'll be just January when a little bit more will be available.] The multiple homeowners in areas subject to capital gains taxes and heavier taxes are estimated to be around 850,000.Among them, it is possible that the so-called gap investment landlords who owe the house could make a sale all at once.Although many of the long-capacity asset owners were more likely to go ahead with the plan, the situation changed in the second half of next year when the government made it official to revise property taxes.It is expected to dispose of apartments outside the Seoul metropolitan area or in rural areas first, due to concerns about tax burden.[Park Won-kap / KB Kookmin Bank's real estate specialist : Multiple residents are more sensitive to holding taxes than capital gains taxes. It is expected that many multiple residents will register as rental apartments or switch to sales.From March, rental operators with higher interest rates on loans than on rental incomes will also face pressure on the Officetel and store markets as RTI regulations limiting lending significantly.( chwijae yeong sang : ,, Video Editors:Lee Hongmyung, VJ : Jung Min-goo (jhpark@sbs.co.kr) [Telepatient & Downsymptoric Girl : Please check the happiness of two people directly at SBS"
"The days of the ultra-low-generation era are over. The global economy started to stretch its grip due to the financial crisis. Last year, the U.S. stock market index and the KOSPI index in Korea set a new record, taking one day apart. What will the global economy look like this year? I looked at it with five keywords.① What options would Jerome Powell, the dollar-barrel (the preference for monetary tightening), make for the doves that are surrounded by overheating and slowing down, when it comes to relaxation? Jerome Powell, who will lead the Federal Reserve System (Fed), is a doves. The mayor considers Janet Jellen as being as cautious and prefers a gradual increase in the base rate. Powell will begin his official term as Fed Chairman in February. We have to make a single line of three key rate hikes between overheating and slowing down. The variable factor is that the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are being replaced by hawks. The rate of increase in the benchmark rate may be faster than expected. Donald Trump recently president the new Fed nominee as a director at Marvin good friend a professor at Carnegie mellondae the hawks. Trump first elected the Fed, Randall, is president for Qualls, regulators, who is a hard-liner. Trump, president can appoint three members of the Board of Governors are more. The right to vote for FOMC will also be transferred to the hawk. FOMC is represented at all times by Fed Chairman, including Chairman, and Federal Reserve Bank President New York. The Federal Reserve Bank presidents of the rest of the country alternate in voting rights. The voting rights of two doves against interest rate hikes - Federal Reserve Bank of Cacicarininia and Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans - are to be voted on by the hawk, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President John Williams. New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dedley, who followed the Fed's policy line, said, "" We will resign to make things more volatile.② Between the dream of a beat coin up and the frustration ... What about Bitcoin, which is called the 21st century tulip, in 2018? Market watchers say the bubble is more likely to burst than to return to last year's 20-fold jump. Motliful, a U.S. investment magazine, predicted on July 24 (local time) that "" Bitcons will fall below $ 1,000 in the future. "" The main reason is the realization of profits of investors who benefited from soaring prices and the possibility of hacking into encrypted currency (virtual currency) exchanges is also a risk factor for Bitcons. As the Japanese stock exchange's Mountakes, which accounted for 70 percent of the total bit coin transactions in 2014, was hacked, 7 percent of the total bit coin circulation was eliminated. A hacking scandal broke out on the Yubbit, Korea Exchange, and about 17 billion won in virtual currency was stolen. Government regulations in each country could hamper the craze. As much of the upward trend of Bitcone is derived from the legalization of Bitcone in Japan (payment), successive regulations may act as a brake system. Some forecast that the bitson will continue to soar. Wall Street investment strategist Tom Lee raised his ' Bitcone Target for 2018 ' to $ 20,000 on July 22 from $ 11,500. That is because virtual currency has an inherent value of block chain technology and reduced price instability as gifts are traded in the U.S. financial market.③ Young industry based on the fourth industrial revolution is expected to accelerate its appearance this year. Global banks such as UBS, Citibank and Barclays are speeding up their adoption of block chain technology, according to the International Financial Center. A block chain is a digital book that records transactions. Instead of a central server, everyone involved in the transaction shares the details. For overseas remittances by bank, it takes at least 2-3 days to review the related documents when using the Inter-Bank Association Payment System (SWIFT). On the other hand, based on block chain technologies, international remittances are possible in real time. 5G (fifth generation mobile communication) technology is also available. 5G, which has a data transfer rate of 20 times faster than 4G, uses a ultra-bandwide frequency of 28 ㎓. One-Man-Man-Man devices within a 1-hour radius are provided with IoT services. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) set the timing for the 5G commercialization in 2020. Each country is fiercely competing to acquire technology standards. U.S. mobile carrier Verizon will begin commercial services in the second quarter of next year. The financial services to compare the products of banks and financial investment firms, and the foldable phones, which are foldable smartphones, are among the younger industries.④ The Brecksheet Congress declares involvement in the negotiation … a divorce process for the EU and Eurozone. The maximum variable threatening the recovery of the eurozone is quicker than expected. The eurozone is forecast to grow 2.4 percent this year, following a 2.3 percent rise last year, according to the Center for International Finance. The European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to complete quantitative easing at the end of this year and raise the key interest rate starting in the mid-19 2019. But the short Brek sheet schedule is a "" stumbling block. "" Britain's Brecksheet said Britain faces a very tight schedule to leave the European Union, according to the Financial Times. The National Assembly denied the government's proposal and said it would intervene in the process of the breakfast. The House of Commons passed an amendment to the EU exit bill that would require parliamentary approval before the administration ratified a package of final withdrawal plans agreed with the EU. The U.K. administration, which is expected to finish the Brecksheet negotiations by October, has added a barrier to parliamentary agreement. Therefore, the time given to the U.K. is actually about six months.⑤ Oil prices are forecast to reach $ 45-55 per new normal barrel … It is expected that when the global economy recovers, a "" new standard "" will be established in the global crude oil market. As "" Sweet Spot "" is maintained at the cost of $ 45-55 per barrel, U.S. Shale Oil Company is acting as the new output controller for OPEC and is therefore the demand for crude oil. The Center for International Finance predicts oil demand will maintain its average rate of growth this year, based on the recovery in emerging economies and the United States. The supply is expected to grow significantly due to the rise of non-Inflation countries such as the United States. However, due to the small oversupply, the market expects oil prices to continue to rise in the second half of last year. However, there are certain risks. First of all, there is the possibility of accelerating demand recovery around the world. Faster recovery means greater than expected global demand for crude oil, creating an ' over-rebalancing ' situation that can turn over sweet spots. It is also possible that U.S. oil exports could soar or OPEC's solidarity with reducing output could lead to an increase in supply. There are geopolitical risks in the Middle East and North Africa, which are always in a state of constant correction instability. Political conditions in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Venezuela, and others should be noted. As of December 31 of last year, the number of Koreans who want to take part in class action suits surpassed 180,000. About 180,000 people attended Apple's class action suit as of 2:00 p.m. on July 31, according to law firm HannurI Law Firm, which is seeking to participate in the iPhone's performance degradation class action. There were about 30,000 people applied by Tuesday morning, but the number of applicants increased by 150,000 within one day after the announcement of the compensation measures (local time). Whimyung Corporation, a law firm, is also receiving applications for litigation. The reason why consumers are so angry with Apple is that they are dissatisfied with Apple's compensation package. Apple said it would lower the cost of replacing the battery to $ 50, from $ 79 to $ 29. Apple Korea also announced that it would lower the cost of replacing the battery to 34,000 won, or 29 dollars, from 100,000 won for Korean consumers who use the iPhone 6 and later. Since Apple admitted the performance of its older iPhones had been reduced due to the iOS update, many say it should support the replacement of batteries for free. Kim Jae-hee jetti@donga.com"
"A sign of the corridor of the Seoul office of the Korea Employment Service for the Disabled, Toegyero, Seoul, on July 27 reads, "" Get rid of the special wage clauses on the minimum wage for the seriously disabled "" near elevators and walls."" One day? "" I'm getting 20,000 won a month. "" This is what a middle-aged woman who met at the Korea Employment Service for the Disabled in Toegye-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul said on July 27, appealing for better working conditions for the severely disabled. The woman, whose children are severely disabled, also vented her anger at the reality that the minimum wage is not applicable.The National Association for the Elimination of Disabled Persons (Jeon Jang-yeon) has taken control of the Seoul office of the industrial complex since November 21 last year and continued its protest for over 40 days. The building with its branch office is filled with A4 paper appeals and information written by disabled people saying they want to work in the right workplace.  Their request calls for scrapping the "" minimum wage exceptions against severely disabled people "" and acknowledging the work of the severely disabled as labor. Article 7 of the Minimum Wage Act currently says that those who have a significantly lower work performance due to mental or physical disabilities (such as those with severe disabilities) can be excluded from the application of minimum wage with the approval of the Minister of Employment and Labor. The government has so far excluded lower wages from the minimum wage requirement, as it aims to create jobs by encouraging companies to hire severely disabled people. In contrast, the severely disabled called for abolition, citing the reality of working at extremely low wages. Disabled people staged a sit-in at the Korea Employment Service in Toegye-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul yesterday. Jung-su (22), who has autism, wants the minimum wage.Chung is working at a rehabilitation facility for disabled people in Seoul, where he closes envelopes and gives trademarks to them. After graduating from a special school, he tried to get a job, but he entered the facility because it was not easy.When he has no work, he sits down in a facility room and waits endlessly with three seriously disabled people. I'm lucky enough to start work when I get a job. The products are classified as products for the disabled and sold.Chung only receives 20,000 won per month. It is because he is still a student. The situation improves when working conditions improve, but only about 100,000 won a month are needed. The reason for the severely disabled's work is that they have a stronger meaning of "" education "" and "" protection "" than "" labor "" because they are not paid the minimum wage. "" I can't get a job because a severely disabled person can not work, and I can't afford to go home all day, so I have to go to the facility, "" Jeong's mother said.Lim (25), who is mentally challenged grade 2, is in the same situation as well. Lim also works as a packer-up at a rehabilitation facility in Seoul. He receives 100,000 won a month. Here, he gets about 70,000 won a month after he removes his share of the expenses of signing up for the four major insurance plans. This is where meals are deducted again. Because of this, Lim's parents said, "" You are still in the red. "" Daejabo, a sign that reads, "" Please do away with the exemption of the minimum wage for the seriously disabled "" was posted here and there on the corridor wall of the Korea Employment Service in Toegye-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul on July 27.The rehabilitation facilities were originally established to provide vocational training and protection for the disabled. On the other hand, the reality is like a place where the severely disabled who can not find work stay content with their small income.According to the report on the status of the economically inactive people in 2016, only 19.7 percent of the severely disabled were employed. This is considerably lower than the minimum wage for the disabled, 43.6 percent. According to a study by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea that year, the average minimum wage for severely disabled workers was also lower at 2630 per hour. Compared to last year's minimum wage of 6,460 won, it is 40 percent.   "" I was not as productive as I was for non-disabled people, but I was working as hard as I could, "" said an aunt with brain lesion grade 2 (26). Members of the Korean Federation for Disabled Persons ' Protection stage protests on Dec. 12 last year`s afternoon above the Jeontaeil Bridge in Jongno-gu, Seoul, demanding the minimum wage law be revised and the Framework Act on Labor.As the hourly minimum wage has risen to 7530 won this year, the disabled person's sense of wonder is bound to be huge. We don`t want the wage of the disabled to be 7530 won, the level of non-disabled, the official explained. Under the minimum wage exclusion clause, the work of the severely disabled has not even been recognized as labor, adding that we should scrap the clause that distinguishes the severely disabled and hire new public jobs. According to Jeon, the U.N. Commission on the Rights of the Disabled, in 2013, advised the Korean government to remove the minimum wage exemption clause for the severely disabled and prepare alternatives. The government has also tried to solve the situation, but the reality is that there is no clear solution. In fact, directors of the Korea Employment Service for the Disabled and employees of the Department of Employment and Employment for the Disabled went to the site to discuss the protest but failed to reach a specific agreement."" It is easy to say that there is a burden on businesses that employs the disabled, and that creating public jobs with the KSPO funds is not a sufficient discussion and clear alternatives are being made in the short term, "" said an official at the park.Ahn Seung-jin, a reporter for the New Year's news conference on North Korea, told The New Year's Daily, "" North Korean Workers ' Party's Office in Seoul that North Korea's nuclear program will successfully meet Kim Jong Un New South Korean leader Kim Jong Un has shown his willingness to talk with his South Korean counterpart to Pyeongchang over the North's nuclear threat, saying, "" The nuclear threat is always on my desk, "" on July 1. Kim made the remark in his New Year speech to nurture North Korea's Central TV station in the morning of that day. "" We made it clear a year ago that an intercontinental ballistic rocket (ICBMs) test preparation project, on behalf of the party and the government, was progressing in the closing stages, "" Kim said, confirming several security tests."" Our Republic has finally got a strong, reliable deterrent that nothing can undo, "" he said. "" America's nuclear threat is so strong it can not be crushed and responded to. The United States can not wage war on Gulcona and our country, he boasted. Kim also said, We need to take the party line in parallel with the plan, develop and produce boring nuclear weapons, complete with its own nuclear weapons structure, and modernize the nuclear rocket production process.As he goes, "" We should have known clearly that the entire United States of America is within our nuclear arsenal, and that the nuclear setup is always on my office desk, not a threat, "" he said.Regarding North Korean relations, Kim said, The conservative government, which had been sticking to the fashionable rule and personality confrontation in the south of the Korean Peninsula, collapsed and the power of the ruling camp changed, making the North Korean government's policy of engaging the North Korean people more strongly opposed to the situation.Without ending this abnormal situation, we can`t avoid the ravages of nuclear war, which is enforced by external forces, let alone unification of the nation, he stressed."" New Year's Day will be marked by the celebration of the founding of the Republic of Korea's 70 stones as the Great Wall of Korea and the hosting of the Olympic Games in the south and outside of the North. """" First of all, we need to ease the tense military situation between the North and the South, and prepare for the peaceful environment of the Korean Peninsula first, "" Kim said. "" It is not the security of a war or of peace in the North.This is interpreted as calling for Seoul to withdraw its military measures to threaten the North, including the suspension of Korea-U.S. military drills during the Pyeongchang Games.Chairman Kim said, "" We have widely realized the contact between the North and the South, cooperation and exchanges, and have solved misunderstanding, distrust of each other, and played a role and responsibility of each of the various opposition groups, "" adding.Regarding the Pyeongchang Olympics, we are willing to take the necessary measures, including dispatching a delegation, and the North Korean authorities may urgently meet to make this happen, the official said.Meanwhile, Chairman Kim's New Year's message was carried out in about 30 minutes from 9.30 a.m. in Pyongyang. He drew attention by taking off Kim Il-sung's badge, appearing in a bright gray suit and tie.▶ Looking back 2017 ' Ten Keywords ' … Enjoy Free Cartoons and Win! ▶ Cheerleader vs. racing girl Park So-yeon soyunp@mt.co.kr< Author : ' Real Time News with Money ' Money-Transplay, No Transporting or Redistribution >"

Fears are being raised that the wage ceiling, which rose 16.4 percent to 7530 per hour starting this year, will fuel inflation.Food prices are sloshing as the minimum wage increases were reflected in menu prices, according to the distribution industry on July 1. Starting the same day, the restaurant franchise A increased prices by 1,000 won. The remaining menu items will be raised at intervals. "" We have raised the prices of major menus by 1,000 won at the request of the shop owners because we can not reduce the number of employees, "" a company official said.

Buffett's victory earned the charity, which he was sponsoring, with a prize of $ 2,220,000 (2.4 billion won), the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on July 1 (local time). Buffett reportedly made a bet with New York hedge fund management firm Protese Partners in 2007 or index funds or hedge funds to see which one would make more profit over the next decade. Buffet's criticism of hedge funds said the fee was too high reflects his usual argument.As part of Warren Buffett's bet, Buffett placed a winning bet on the S&P 500 Index Funds of Bangard and the Proteid Fund in a selection of five hedge funds. The two sides also agreed to bet $ 320,000 each on a bet and invest it in U.S. government bonds. In addition, the fund, which will grow to $ 1 million together with its principal and interest in the next 10 years, will be donated to charities designated by winners. The showdown of the century, which began on January 1, 2008, ended with Buffett's landslide victory on January 29, the last day of the New York stock market last year. Buffet's index fund earned an annual profit of 7.1 percent until the end of 2016, while Protese's hedge fund earned only 2.2 percent. Considering that the S&P 500 index rose 19.5 percent from the beginning of last year, Buffett's victory is overwhelming since 2013. Buffett has also stressed that he is confident he will win the 10-year race against the Protese this year. Buffett's victory brought a big smile to the charity Girls of Omaha, a charity that he promised would hand over prizes 10 years ago, the WSJ said. Buffett and Protese earlier agreed to put stakes on the table for 11,200 Berkshire B shares in late 2012, as bond prices rose faster than expected due to falling U.S. interest rates. As Berkshire shares soared 121 % in the high altitude, the prize money increased to $ 2.22 million, more than double what people had expected. Girls ' is a nonprofit organization that provides education and rehabilitation programs for young girls aged 6 to 18. "" The real winner in the 10-year bet by Buffett and Hedge Fund is ' Girls of Omaha, ' "" said the charity, "" is also offering a new home for girls who are older than their foster age. "" The group also added, "" Although no one knew for a long time what Buffett would win, he wasn't sure what would happen to the girls. "" However, it is now expected that Buffett and Hedge Fund will not face each other again, reported CNBC Broadcasting Company. Buffett, 88, wrote in an email to fund manager Mark Yusco last October, "" I'm not going to be able to do that much investment competition with hedge funds until I turn 97. "" vivid@yna.co.kr has been confirmed to be the lowest number of defectors since 2002. The reasons for the decline were North Korea`s strengthening border control and worsening relationship with North Korea and China. According to the Unification Ministry on July 1, the number of defectors who entered South Korea in 2017 was 1,044 as of late November. It was the smallest number since 2002 when the number of defectors who escaped from the South was significantly tallied. We don`t count the number of North Korean defectors yet, but we do know that it will be only about the lowest level since 2017, said an official at the Unification Ministry. As of the end of November 2017, a total of 36,1256 South Koreans have defected from the South.The number of North Korean defectors who reached below 1,000 before the 2000s continued to grow to nearly 3,000 in 2009, up from 1142. However, the trend has decreased since then, when then Democratic Labor Party Chairman Kim Jong-un took power. The number of defectors who escaped from North Korea in 2012 dropped to 1,502, half of the 2,706 in 2011, and after the decline, it was only estimated to surpass 1,000 in 2017. Analysts say that the reason for the decline is due to North Korea's stronger border control and tighter unity in the Kim Jong Un administration. In addition, North Korea experts cited worsening relations between North Korea and China as the reason for the decrease in defectors. We know that China as well as North Korea has tightened control by barbed wire, said Kim Young-hee, chief economist at the Korea Development Bank. Meanwhile, some analyze that the economic situation in North Korea has improved paradoxically according to international sanctions on the North, reducing the incentive of North Koreans to defect. An official who recently met a North Korean defector said, "" I don't think I deserve to leave North Korea when I eat and live in the North. "" He said, "" If I don't want to leave my home town on guilt, I should leave North Korea. "" In other words, the domestic market is becoming more active even temporarily, as international sanctions on North Korea blocked export channels to China and other countries.

When the government received orders for the nuclear plant, it sent an Ark unit consisting of 150 special forces troops from the United Arab Emirates. At the time, the government claimed to protect nuclear plants and the people, but experts say that it sent troops to UAE to fulfill military cooperation, such as training programs. According to Kim, the arms trade with Middle Eastern countries is quite complicated. The countries say they lack the ability to operate while purchasing advanced weapons.

It is not worth responding to, said the National Assembly, already agreeing to send troops to the UAE, and digging into the background of the incident is a preposterous allegation. The National Assembly passed a motion to extend the deployment of troops to Iraq by one year at a plenary session Dec. 1. There were also suspicions that the Defense Ministry had selected six members of its military cooperation team to send additional troops to Akh in August but failed due to opposition from the UAE. UAE is known to have protested the selection of defense experts instead of combat trainers. Regarding this, a presidential official said, Even though we don`t know the details, `` Even so, it was not a practical level of problem that could turn into a problem between countries. '' Cheong Wa Dae uae Muhammad kaldun Khalifa, a close associate of the tax system, Mubarak Abu Dhabi government to know the head of the Moon Jae-in, Seoul at the beginning of the president's visit to uae is pushing. Lim decided that the two countries would make a breakthrough in the recovery, and plans to strengthen the summit visits. If the agreement with the UAE exists and the contents are disclosed, it is expected that the two countries will recover their relationship. It can affect contracts with other Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia. As military cooperation with the Middle East has become more manageable, Kim said, There are also resources diplomacy in Saudi Arabia. The UAE problem may not be the end.

"■ News 1 : 460,000 workers who received minimum wage from Lee Eun-ju Designer ... Concerns over the minimum wage increase starting today is 16.60 %. The maximum wage stabilization fund effect is unknown (Sejong = News 1). Moon Jae-in government that won through first button of the achievement of price increase, 10,000 hourly minimum wage income by 2020 initiative that positive growth prospects and job losses.Will bring negative outlook is so fierce cross to 'soft landing of the minimum wage' are likely to emerge as major tasks this year. ◇ Minimum wage impact = 4.46 million workers on the first day of income driven growth = According to the Ministry of Employment and Labor, the rate of workers who are directly affected by the increase in minimum wage from this year reaches the lowest level of 23.6 million (minimum wage). About 23 out of 100 workers are affected by the "" minimum wage "" as the highest rate ever recorded (174 percent). If the minimum wage is converted to daily wage of 8 hours this year, it will cost 62,240 won. If the minimum wage is converted to monthly wage, it will cost 1,757,377 won for 40-hour weeks (including paid weekly leave). The price of luxury goods rose by 8480 won and the salary increased by 225,400 won. The vacation pay for the vacation before and after the departure from the previous month was 1,500,000 won per month, and the maximum for unemployment benefits was 680,000 won per month, up from 50,000 won per month.It is expected that household income and income distribution will improve as income and support for workers increases. The minimum wage increase is expected to contribute to income distribution and the reduction in wage inequality, said Kim Joon-jun, head of the Environmental Labor Team at the National Assembly Research Service. Median wage is the income of workers who are at the very center of their income when all wage earners are set as income sundos. With the high rise in the minimum wage, the government is pushing for an income driven growth. Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance Kim Dong-yeon told a meeting of economy-related ministers in November last year that better working income is more important than other things to achieve income growth, and that starting with a minimum wage increase was the start. The logic is that by raising the minimum wage, low-income workers will have to increase their household income and spend more to lead the growth. The logic also suggests that the Gini coefficient, a typical measure of income inequality, rose to 0.357 last year from the previous year, giving rise to a deepening polarization and rising relative poverty rate. A part-time worker works at a convenience store in Jongno-gu, Seoul, when the minimum wage was decided in 2018. ▽ 2017.7.16 / News 1 / = Fears over a job security effect = It is uncertain, but opposition is also growing. Concerns are rising that small businesses or small businesses may reduce hiring or run a course because they can not afford to pay steep labor costs. The minimum wage hikes have an effect on income conservation for low-income workers, but at the cost of small businesses, they have two sides, said Lee Yoon-jae, economics professor at Soongsil University. Small and midsize businesses estimate that the minimum wage increase this year will add up to 15-20 trillion won in additional labor costs for businesses. The move to reduce hiring has been shown through various recent surveys. The KBIZ surveyed 300 small businesses last December and found that eight out of 10 companies surveyed had no or no plans to hire. Only 18.1 percent of the companies answered that they had a plan to hire. In the 2018 job-seeking plan, which was adopted by the job portal Albamon, 79.3 percent answered that "" the minimum wage increase is not going to affect next year's job-shop, "" and added that they had no impact on the bottom line. By industry, the job cuts at bakery, dessert and ice cream centers were highest at 95 percent, followed by Δ family restaurants, fast food restaurants and restaurants at 92.9 percent of Δ coffee chains at 86.0 percent.Some say the impact of the minimum wage hikes on the loss of employment will not be huge. Analysts say the government's 3 trillion won job security fund will support the move. As the minimum wage support budget, employers with less than 30 workers will receive 130,000 won per month per employee, or less than 1.9 million won per month. However, since the support coverage is expected to vary widely and the cases are expected to vary, it is not clear yet how much effect it will have. It is also expected that the resistance of the business owners who failed to make the cut will be strong. Although the government`s policy direction is to raise the minimum wage to an appropriate level, there is a minimum amount of support for them to consider as small business owners, said Park Ji-soon, a professor at the Korea Labor University. The country`s three mobile operators plan to make full-scale investment starting this year with the goal of commercialization in 2019. If the cost of the auction for spectrum, which is scheduled for June, is added, the initial investment is expected to surpass 10 trillion won.◇ 20 trillion won for simple calculations = Mobile communication businesses and the Ministry of Science and Technology and Information, according to the daily variable sharing of necessary equipment and equipment, the government and three transportation companies plan to start commercial operations of 5G by 2019. Facility investment is expected to start in earnest after the auction of spectrum this year and concentrate for the next three to four years. LTE investment took a similar period. Looking at the annual CAPEX costs of the three companies, it exceeded 6 trillion won in 2010, was gradually reduced to 7 trillion won in 2011, right before LTE commercialization, and decreased to 8 trillion won in 2012 and to 8 trillion won in 2013. 5G is currently one step further advanced than LTE and therefore, initial investment is expected to be costly. Moreover, due to the high accuracy of radio waves and the short reach, base stations should be mounted more closely than LTE. As a result, the total investment is forecast to grow by more than 20 % over LTE.SK Telecom President Park Jeong-ho of SK Securities said in a parliamentary audit, "" 5G said we should have installed base stations three times more closely than LTE, which would cost us about 8 trillion won to build 4G. "" Assuming that each company's facility investment is close to its market share, the investment costs of the three companies ' total investment amounts to 20 trillion won. However, thanks to the development of communication technologies that help utilize existing LTE equipments and small base stations (Smalsel) and increase transmission efficiency, investment costs will be reduced. SK Securities Co. said in a recent report that it is highly likely to deploy High-ga-Rate LTE together in the early stage of its 5G commercialization, reducing investment costs by allowing smaller, low-powered base stations to be installed at a lower cost than their existing ones. Once essential facilities sharing is realized, it is expected that the investment burden will be further decreased. Required facilities refer to wired facilities essential to telecommunication businesses, such as poles and ducts. Most of the country`s communication essentials are owned by KT. The government is set to improve the joint construction of necessary facilities in the first half of next year to reduce the burden of investing in 5G. We hope the three carriers share vital facility information on 5G in a news conference last month, ministry Minister Yoo Young-min said, reaffirming his commitment to the policy. SK Telecom and LG U + are expected to reduce the initial investment burden when necessary facilities can be shared. However, as KT is reluctant to invest in the industry, it is expected that sharing will be difficult.◇ Stop the "" curse of winner "" or the "" winner "" of an auction scheduled in June is another measure that will determine the initial investment costs. As 5G frequencies are wider in bandwidth than LTE, the bidding price for auction is expected to surpass LTE's. The previous three LTE frequency allocations reached 6.241 trillion won. The allocation is based on payments made over the next five to 10 years, with the cost of paying three companies per year at about one trillion won. The Ministry of Information and Communication recently predicted that the winning bid for 5G spectrum this year would reach 10 trillion won if the LTE auction price was to be used as usual. As a result, news agencies awarded were concerned that they would have difficulty avoiding the "" curse of winners. "" Reflecting these concerns, the ministry will revise the way it calculates the 5G spectrum allocation cost. He has already operated a research team to improve the system and study ways to reduce the quota. As the government has pledged to lower the allocation price, the cost of 5G spectrum is expected to be greatly reduced. In addition, the installment plan is expected to reduce the initial burden. We can`t determine the exact size of the investment as the technology standards are not set yet, industry watchers say, We are watching the trend since sharing spectrum allocation costs and vital equipment is the key variable. okko@yna.co.kr"
"▽ New Seoul = Civic group members including non-full-paid workers ' union activities held a press conference Thursday morning in front of Gwanghwamun Avenue, declaring "" Youth University Student's Minimum wage at 10,000 won per passion. "" ▽ Employment agencies for teenagers who violate the law by 80.7 % in the second half of the year, and inspection businesses in the second half of the year were found to have violated their work contracts. The Ministry of Employment and Labor announced on July 24 to December 24, 2017 that it conducted a general inspection of 3002 stores, hair salons, and gas stations with a high percentage point of entry into the law, and found that 80 to 13 out of total violations of basic employment regulations. The rate of violations in the law increased by 3.6 percent in the first half of last year and by 60 percent in the case of judicial review. There were 1121 areas that did not pay properly, and 4,152 people did not receive more than 1.5 billion won in total. Only 143 places violated the minimum wage standard, with 330 people earning less than 140 million won. There were also some areas in Dandong that had not written down their work contracts. More than half of the workplaces have not properly created work contracts. The percentage of violations of the written work contract was 63.3 percent at restaurants, 55.0 percent at hair salons, and 62.9 percent at gas stations. The delayed payment of wages was also serious. Gas station workers were forced to pay 41.0 percent of their wages in arrears. Four out of 10 gas stations did not pay the right amount of money. Other restaurants, such as 37.5 percent and hair salons 32.4 percent, saw similar situations. Among 2,244 businesses that violated the law, 1882 carried out administrative orders. The ministry has prosecuted 24 other businesses that have implemented the correction order and fined 300. At present 218 locations are under corrective action. We plan to strengthen our labor supervision this year over minimum wage compliance and the creation of written work contracts, the ministry said, particularly focusing on the minimum wage increase, with less than 30 employees scheduled to follow suit. positive100@newsis.com○ Development of a new research robot that will groom Korea with robot robots The path was slightly separated by blocks of cement, along with a slope of 35 degrees that surpassed that of the ski resort's senior course, but the robot moved forward one step at a time without flailing. When one leg was being moved, the other was balanced on three legs. It is a four-legged walking robot called Jinpung 2, which was developed by the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology. It is a name that takes the initials of Jindo dogs and Pungsan-gae, Cho said, We can use it to navigate disaster sites and search for victims in the near future.Iron dogs, made by Korean scientists, are ready to shock the world. In bumpy areas, four-footed robots are much more advantageous than wheels, an unlimited track, or a two-footed robot. Iron dogs can do dangerous work for humans and scout the enemy on disaster sites or on battlefield sites. Usually, you can ask for a newspaper and jog with your owner like a pet. Delivery services are also available.◇ Jinpung 2, developed by the Korea Institute of Structural Technology and the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, is equipped with a hydraulic driving device. Hydraulic powered by oil pressure is used primarily for construction machines that need strong force, such as ground drilling machines. In 2005, the robot robot was developed by Boston Dynamics, followed by the robot, BigDog, which was developed by Hanwha, Hyundai Rotem, and others. Jinpung 1 can carry up to 60kg of cargo, but Jinpung 2 can carry up to 100kg, said Cho. Walking has become much more natural. In the past, we made a movement by combining vertical and horizontal movement, said Dr. Cho Jeong-san, Now, we can separate the horizontal and vertical parts altogether and operate much simpler.Iron dogs were originally developed for military use, but neither the big dogs nor the real winds have yet been in the military. The noisy engine and high fuel consumption made it difficult to use for military operations. Researchers at the institute instead turned to disaster sites. To that end, she plans to have a robotic arm in her anti-seismic hair this August. A researcher held a mechanical device in his arm and followed the robot's arm. Jinpung 2 will be able to lock the valve with its robotic arm following human movement in the affected factory, said Park Sang-duk, a senior researcher at the robot group Saeng-kyeon.Technology in the true wind can be used anywhere else. Along with Hanyang University and Susan Heavy Industries, the company is also developing remote controlled robots with two robotic arms that enter the vacuum of the drilling machine. "" Later, I could wear four front-legged legs instead of an unlimited orbit, "" Cho said. The global excavator market will grow from $ 38.7 billion (41.35 trillion won) in 2016 to $ 64.7 billion (69.13 trillion won) in 2024, according to market research firm Goldman Research. Some of these robots can develop new markets for trillions of won.◇ Robots with a 1m jump are more powerful than me at disasters, but agility is the most important factor in life. Professor Kim Sang-bae at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is the world leader in this field. Kim invented the "" cheetah, "" a running quiet dog in 2013. They also run at 6 meters per second, jumping over obstacles. Electro-motor robots have been a barrier to commercial use, and have improved their energy efficiency 20-fold by recycling shock energy generated when their feet touched the ground, Kim said. Boston Dynamics followed Professor Kim to revise the Iron Dog development strategy. Spot, introduced in 2015, is equipped with an electric motor powered by a gasoline engine and starting the following year, the spotmine is running its electric motor by battery.Professor Kim is currently developing the cheetah 3 with support from Naver and others. The cheetah learned that it can lean on the stairs under the pressure of its legs, significantly reducing the cost of cameras and laser sensors, Kim said. You can also press the elevator button or jump to a height of 1m with one foot up.Scientists are predicting the start of commercial use of the Iron Dog soon. In China, research and pet "" Laika "" was released late last year for $ 20,000-3,000 (about 32 million won) per child. The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich also introduced Annie Malle, a robot that can be put in the gas or oil refinery's accident scene at any time. Professor Kim Sang-bae also said, "" I was asked whether or not the three cheetahs were dispatched to the nuclear plant accident site in the U.S. "" We can use it anywhere, but it can be commercialized within a year, Kim said.[Science reporter Lee Young-wan goes straight to Dooson.com] - Copirits : Chosun Ilbo & Chosun.com, No Uncommissioned Additions and Redistribution -"
"Digital promotion videos and slogans may be filled by fans who have left out cosmetic ads they produce. People can say different things about the results of the advertisement by cheering idol singers or celebrating the birthday inside Samsung Station. ▽ Photo : When reporter Kim Yu-ah went down to Seoul Subway Line No. 2, a large digital screen was displayed on both walls. After the performance of a famous idol singer was shown and the video ended in about 10 seconds, the phrase "" Happy birthday, 00! "" appeared. Some of the citizens urged their feet to move. Passing the screen, a large billboard called ' Wide Color ' entered the passage. Seven of the 16 ads are for idol groups. Chinese tourist Chang Jianshin (29. female), who was filming an advertisement for a male idol singer, responded with a curious reaction, "" I heard that in Korea fans produce their own ads. ""Advertisements celebrating or cheering the birthday of idol singers dominate subway stations. Some citizens are complaining amid the rise of a "" Fandom culture, "" in which fans voluntarily gather to promote their favorite singers.■ According to Seoul Transportation Corporation on December 31, 2006, the number of ads in subway stations executed by idol singers was 1,038 as of the end of 2017, more than double the number of ads last year from about 400. As the Seoul Transportation Corporation decided to increase advertisement for public service advertisement or culture and art, and as idol ads are being filled out of plastic surgery ads, idol fan clubs are emerging as leading customers in the advertising market at subway stations.The public advertisement for idol singers at subway stations and bus stops made headlines in 2011 when an advertisement supporting male singer group JYJ appeared in subway stations. Later, as audition programs for viewers to vote became popular, idol ads featuring fan's "" Dreams Come True, Cheer With One Table, "" were turned into competitive ads.Celebrities caught fire, too. In March, a member of a male idol group posted a photo on social networking sites of their birthday celebrations looking for the photo. One entertainment agency even advertised messages from idol singers to their fans and posted them on subway stations. Now, the subway angelfill ads are connecting fans and stars, explained the A advertising company that produces the ad.The public is generally a positive response. Jin-mo (39) said, It is funny. I used to pass by the billboard casually, but when I saw an idol ad, I sometimes looked into it with someone saying, "" This person is someone. "" A student who took pictures of her friends in front of an advertisement board for a male idol group said, I came here hoping that the celebrity who took the photo with the certificate will post it. Although there was no sticky note, Lee was delighted to use the photo as the background for her phone.■ Water debt is an ' inconvenient ' advertisement for an entertainer, but other citizens are complaining about ads that support celebrities with social issues. Han (25) was shocked to see an advertisement for an idol singer at a subway station in Gangnam-gu. Recently, there was a big advertisement celebrating the anniversary of idol stars ' debut in search terms that led to a sex scandal. Han said, "" You can't say you can get off on a public display because you pay for ads. "" The Seoul Metropolitan Transit Authority reported that for this reason, a petition was filed to remove ads and the ads will be closed within a week in consultation with the advertiser's fan club.However, it is difficult to immediately respond to a dispute. It is difficult to know if there is a dispute between each and every one of them, said an official at the Seoul Transportation Authority.Popular culture commentator Chung Duk-hyun said, As the new Fandom culture continues to emerge, the voices of people raising the issue are getting louder, the controversial ads of celebrities could have backfired. As it became difficult to buy or sell a house due to regulations on lending and transfer and income tax, the sale decreased, and the donation of wealth to children and others in the form of donation from the department was increased. Last year, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport and the Korea Institute of Standards and Technology announced yesterday that the volume of housing transactions nationwide stood at 875,458 cases, down by 9.42 percent from the same period in November 2016. With the new government's series of measures to boost lending and taxation, such as the June 19 measure and August 2 measure, buyers delayed selling their homes, and buyers waited with anticipation of a fall in housing prices, reducing their transactions. Another reason for the decline is that the reduction in the number of loans has led to higher costs of buying homes by buyers. In particular, Seoul, which is heavily regulated such as overheated speculation zones, saw its accumulated sales volume fall 11.3 percent to 174,57 from the same period last year (196,261). Gyeonggi Province saw a decline of 9.64 percent from the same period of 2016 (253,955 cases), while Busan saw a decrease of 857,708 percent year-on-year (686,504 cases). Experts predict that the number of housing transactions will be around 900,000 in 2017 after exceeding one million in the two consecutive years in 2015 and 2016. Meanwhile, the number of houses donated by the government is expected to reach an all-time high last year. In November last year, the total number of accumulated gifts stood at 79,364, an increase of 11.3 percent from the same period last year (72,344 cases). The number of gifts for the first year of 2016 (85,557), which was the highest ever recorded for housing donation, was also close to the record, so the total number of gifts given in December was also higher. Sales in Seoul decreased last year, but the number of gifts rose 10.1 percent to 12,759 in November from 11,588 in the same period last year. Whereas the gift rates of Gangnam-gu and Songpa-gu decreased 14.3 percent and 33.7 percent respectively from 2016, Gangdong-gu saw a whopping 198.3 percent year-on-year decline to 1,222. It is believed that the donation demand was high at Dunchon Jugong apartments in Godeok - dong and other newly built apartments, where the volume of transactions skyrocketed due to the approval of management disposition plans last May. In addition, Yongsan-gu (74.8 percent), Gwanak-gu (58.0 percent), Seongbuk-gu (55.7 percent), Jung-gu (48.3 percent), Yeongdeungpo-gu (44.8 percent), and Eunpyeong-gu (36.1 percent), Yeongdeungpo-gu (36.1 percent), Seoul (36.1 percent) and Yeongdeungpo-gu (31.8 percent) increased by 2005. Busan, the capital of apartment complex, saw its sales decrease, but the number of gifts was 5,232, up 21.1 percent from the year before. Gyeonggi Province's gifts amounted to 17.6 percent in the first 11 months of last year, up from 15,306 a year earlier. The increase is due to the increase in the number of "" donation funds "" that are used to buy homes for children on loan or rent. In addition, as more and more people give gifts before inheritance to pay their respects to people for tax purposes, the number of gifts is on the rise. The number of home gifts rose from 54,464 in 2013 to 66,893 in 2014 and exceeded 80,000 in 2016. A representative of a local brokerage house in Seocho-gu said, I do not expect house prices to go up in the future, so I will often rent out a small amount of money to my children or give them a name in advance, and I usually buy apartments in the name of Gangnam. In particular, more people have chosen to give as gifts rather than sell their homes or register for rental businesses before the transfer income tax in April this year. One agency owner in Gangnam-gu said, "" There are multiple homeowners who consider giving to their children to avoid the burden of capital gains taxes, "" and added, "" If the number of multiple home owners goes ahead, it will increase.

"Kim Jong-un Announces to U.S. Global Summit on Nuclear Danchun [Production Committee Chairman Cho Hae-in and Choi Ja-yoon] : "" New Year's speech by Cheong Wa Dae official Kim Jong-un, who is concerned about possible a rift between the two Koreas and the U.S. ""2018.1.1 [Available only locally ; no redistribution. Lee Sang-hyeon, a reporter of the South Korea-U.S. Use Only in the Republic of Korea Redistribution]nkphoto@yna.co.kr( (Yonhap News Agency), released on July 1 as a New Year message released by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un toward the North will be split into South Korea and the United States. In his New Year's message, Kim said, "" The entire United States is within our nuclear strike zone, "" and knew that "" the nuclear button was always sitting on my office desk, not a threat, "" and knew it was the reality straight up. Regarding inter-Korean relations, he said, "" We need to improve the North Korean relations, which have been frozen in a state of expertise this year, in order to make our national ambassadors magnificent and to let the people's dignity and spirits go. "" He also said he expected the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics to be carried out successfully, adding, We are willing to take necessary steps, including dispatching a delegation, and the North Korean government could urgently meet with him to help. It reaffirmed the completion of its nuclear weapons program last year and reinforced the threat with the expression ' nuclear buttons on the table ' while turning to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics proposal for Korea. Kim Jong-un's remark is apparently intended to resolve the current situation, which is suffering from strong international sanctions against North Korea due to repeated nuclear and missile provocations, through dialogue with South Korea. Some analyze that the U.S. Trump administration is trying to open the door to North Korean dialogue with the North as it maintains a strong stance of sanctions against the North. Once the worldwide peace and reconciliation festival of Pyeongchang is just a month away, the North's proposal to hold dialogue will likely have a positive response from Seoul and the United States. Moon Jae-in, if it already but the government in July last year to non-response to North Korea military talks, such as the 'The door to dialogue' between the two Koreas, which is tightly closed.Can also predict that a rare open. National Diplomat Professor Kim Hyun-wook said, [North Korea's delegation sent] to Pyeongchang [production photo] [Kim Hyun-wook] looks as if it is now watching North Korea's move to normalize relations between the two Koreas and the United States and South Korea. The United States can not make any pressing remarks on the Pyeongchang Olympics. Moon Jae-in, president and North Korea's denuclearization of North Korea in, some worry that the position of 'North Korean leadership`s increasing' (pg) collected a force for cooperation between Seoul and Washington on the composition of the crack occurs.Also fears that the number of experts.

Some say that the new proposal is intended to create a rift between the U.S. and Korea. Accordingly, the Moon Jae-in the government does from now on 'Driver' of the journey towards peace in talks with North Korea, through close communication between the U.S. when to detailed dialogue with the DPRK.Detail the conditions and speed to coordinate their efforts is that analysts say will be more important. Professor Yang Moo-jin of the University of North Korean Studies said, We have shown the North Korea has recently shown a tactical change to the South by engaging in a joint venture with the United States. We can push ahead with it consistently when the two countries become one voice. "" Professor Kim Hyun-wook also said (when talking with the North Korean proposal), I suspect there is pressure from the U.S. government on the South Korean government. How we manage the differences in the future is our homework. We have always been in the process of coordinating the relationship between Korea and the United States, but we believe it will become more important in the future, an official at the Foreign Ministry said. hapyry@yna.co.kr Las Vegas : Seo Young-jun, reporter and Cto?

China is running away from criticism, saying, The North Korea-China Marine Oil Mill Bridge is not real, but if the suspicions are confirmed, it can not avoid the criticism that it is a hole to punish the North. China's state-run China State Security Agency claimed on Dec. 31 that the Wright House Winmore was known to be a vessel hired by a Taiwanese company. Taiwan companies rented if the ship, Chinese Foreign Ministry is “China's involvement is, Cheong Wa Dae showed no.” explanation for the force is be in Global Times is Donald.Trump, the United States president ‘ in the act are so busted.

Taiwan's Transport Ministry admitted that the Winmore boat was being rented out and used by Tangar-based Viliance bunker group, but denied that the group was linked to the Marshall Islands. The Marshall Islands is an ally of Taiwan, where many Taiwanese companies have held and invested their assets since diplomatic ties in 1998. The United Nations Security Council blacklist of illegally functioning ships on Dec. 28 last year also revealed that "" rogue ships "" originally requested by the United States were excluded by Chinese opposition. The Wall Street Journal reported on December 29 (local time) that out of the 10 defective ships originally requested by the U.S., Winmore 2, Kaishang, Shinseong High, Yuan, and Gloryhof did not agree on total 6. As Winmore and Samjung-2, which are being detained by the government, were not included in the vessel, it is pointed out that the kernel is missing.

"Professor Cho Hong-seop from Yongbuk Animal Community College showed up at Japanese university with 1.5 million Korean hunting dogs and dogs suffering from the disease. "" After decades of effort, we restored the sapsarees, and in the process, we saw a short, furry, native dog that was believed to have died out completely. The rock was revived from the dust screen and folklore, "" said a dog that was not accompanied by Ha Ji-hong, a professor of biology and science at Kyungpook National University, at Sapsal Sapsal Cancer Research Center in Gyeongsan, North Gyeongsang Province on July 8. Small dots are stuck in the big, chestnut pattern and a blunt opening. The medium size, ears were lying down, the tail was standing, and the friendly, sparkling eyes looked intelligent. Badugi is a Korean native dog that is rooted in emotion. My brother went to school. You should play with me. Come here, Baduk. Come here. "" "" The first Korean textbook published by the South Korean government in 1948 begins with Young Young's words. The first Korean textbook published in 1948 by the Korean government, titled "" Badugi and Chulsu, "" Ha is dedicated to finishing a new breed of samgyopsal, a fur-looking breed of dogs. As the year 2018 was marked, the team looked into the possibility of the restoration of Korean dogs. When I started as a professor at Kyungpook National University in 1985, I started the Sapsal Restoration Project. Is it not yet complete? Until Shilla and Sapsal, a dog breed that was restored from Sapsal Hospital in Gyeongsan-si, North Gyeongsang Province, there was a hybrid dog that has grown for more than 1,000 years, attracting public attention as it retains its own dog gene. "" The sapsaree restoration process in our memories and paintings is complete. However, I have a desire to make a dog with competitive traits compared to a foreign dog. Since its designation in 1992, we have grown more than 8,000 sapsaree dogs through breeding, and the task of choosing and fixing good traits is almost finished. "" "" Interestingly, single mothers were constantly born at a rate of 3 percent in the long breed of sapsarees. It's a byproduct. "" It's similar to the Korean artist's painting, baduk, by Kim Doo-ryang, which is a one-mother sapsaree. Baduk, one of the single parent sapsarees that appears regularly in the process of bringing in Sapsal dogs, is similar to the dog drawn by Kim Doo-ryang. Since short, furry dogs are different from the original sapsarees, shouldn't they be destroyed? "" That's not true. Our ancestors never intentionally created dog breeds. Small dogs with many colors and shapes, such as yellow, black, baduk, and white, were bred freely. Many dogs with short hair were just dumpy dogs, and some dogs used to call their dogs six-haired, or salak dogs. The royal sapsaree was bred seriously by the royal family and became a mongred after Silla collapsed. "" Yes. More than one thousand years after Silla, Sapsal dogs became domestic dogs without distinction of pure and mixed breed. The sapsaree raised by our ancestors is a mutt with five long hairs, and the restored sapsaree is a breed that is artificially fixed and made of pure breed. The prototype is a sapsaree of the past left in paintings or in shijo, but it is a feature that matches modern times. The restoration process involves thorough historical research, reliable character fixing, and aesthetic sense. The German Shepherd, the world's best dog, is also a prototype for some mixed-bred shepherds from Karlsruhe, Germany 150 years ago. "" Professor Ha Ji-hong (left), a Jindo dog, says of Korean tradition. In the late 1960s, Professor Tak Yeon-bin and Professor Ha Seong-jin of Kyungpook National University decided to restore Sapsal with 30 long, hair-natured dogs, so to speak, a well-qualified shepherd dog. "" It was a kind of ore rock that could be tempered to make steel and pig iron. It was also a "" gene pool "" of indigenous dogs, which were constantly mixed and unique. Killed the Japanese occupation when 1.5 million native dogs for fur animals. They have taken every big, good dog from anywhere they can get to. Since the 1970s, we have brought in many large, large-breasted Japanese dogs to breed with native dogs from the countryside, and recently, the restored breed of western origin is the "" Shinseo, "" says one of the youngest dog breeds. The breeds of dogs with medium short hair survived in part in remote mountainous areas such as Pungsan-gae and Jindo Dogs, while the sapsals, which used to be found throughout the country, were preserved. Fortunately, the sapsaree gene pool contained the characteristics of a medium - to one-mother native dog that is now gone. For example, the bottle of glass bottle with the Nakdong River water floating down the drain to Jeju Island, and now the cap is closed, so we can get the original water that was not mixed in with the sea water and the Nakdonggang River in the past. "" Yes. About 250 years ago, short, medium, and short tow baduk (baduk), which was sitting in the middle of a screen during the Joseon Dynasty, was born by a sapsaree dog named nuongi, and blacks. There are 70 to 80 dogs including dogs, but they are well preserved and when they are bred together, they are 100 % short. In fact, single mother species and long hair breeds are only one difference among the gene's three billion base pairs, but short hair traits are highly recessive, and are mostly born single mothers. It is much easier to care for and healthier than a long furry dog. "" This is the multicolored sapsaree, a species of species of species that was born in the process of raising sapsarees. Now may be the prototype of a lost native dog. What is needed for conservation of sapsarees to lead to the restoration of native dogs? "" Looking at pictures from the Joseon Dynasty, there are many species of single mother, especially baduk. When Sapsal dogs were first designated as natural monuments, it was urgent to see even the long furry ones as sapsarees. Spirited sapsarees and short fur sapsarees can represent native dogs throughout the country, just like two sides of a coin. Attention is needed to conservation and restoration. For example, if you can breed cattle in the metropolitan area, I think it would have a high educational and therapeutic value.

"FTC Announces to Resolve Consumer Dispute Resolution Administrations Even if baggage handling is delayed, the payment could be refunded on the plane if the plane cancelled its reservation in case it was delayed by one hour. If you cancel your travel reservations for compelling reasons, you may be exempt from penalty. The Fair Trade Commission announced on July 1 that it would announce its plan to revise the consumer dispute resolution standards, which contains such information. As the holidays take place, Incheon Airport is packed with tourists. Consumers can still get reimbursed for late plane baggage.[Yonhap news] At present, when the baggage is checked by Airline, Airline has only compensated for the loss or breakage of baggage. There was no provision for compensation for delays in transport. The commission ordered people to pay for damages in case of delayed consignment deliveries. It also provided that, until now, if an aircraft is delayed or failed to arrive at a transport service due to violent reasons, such as bad weather conditions, airport conditions, or so forth, it should be exempted from this obligation without the need of Airline to prove it. In the future, even if an aircraft fails to operate as scheduled due to compelling reasons, it is only exempt if the airline proves that it is not responsible. If you cancel your reservation for a restaurant within the next hour, you will not be able to get it back. Reimbursements from default are increased when using an international plane. So far, if Airline fails to provide an alternative, $ 400 has been reimbursed and $ 600 will have to be reimbursed in the future. 10 % of the fare is compensated for delays of one or two hours or less when using domestic passengers. Korean passengers were only responsible for the delay of more than two hours. There will also be a new regulation on the cancellation of reservations for restaurant reservations, such as the sale of materials by small businessmen, and the elimination of so-called "" no-shows "" (no.). To prevent the probe, the commission imposed stricter penalties on the traditional catering business by separating it into catering and catering. The revision prescribed a new deposit refund as of one hour before the reservation time. Previously, cancellation of reservation allowed customers to get a refund on their deposit. However, the company cancelled the reservation for less than one hour, or made a new penalty payment so that one can not get a penny back without seeing the restaurant without cancellation. Refunds and penalties for post-natal clinics and restaurants have also been improved. As the ‘ total amount of use ’ for calculating the penalty, which is not clear, was not set up at the sports facilities, leisure service businesses, and postpartum care centers, there was a lot of arguing between the business operators and the consumers. The FTC defines the total amount of use as the amount of the purchase and sale set by the contract. Consumers could be exempted from penalties if they cancel their contract with a travel company for unavoidable reasons, not natural disasters, or other reasons, such as the result of an influenza pandemic or contagious diseases. Consumers are advised to make more reasonable improvements to the criteria for resolving consumer disputes in areas closely related to people`s lives, such as aviation and catering, and catering, said Nam Young-il, director of the commission's consumer policy bureau.

She has her hair neatly folded back, a white shirt, a tie, and a cardigan.

Before you start, turn on the ignition to wake up the bus that was frozen all night. The 152 buses, which travel from Ui-dong to Danggok Intersection (Boramae Hospital), runs from northeast to southwest of Seoul. The best three seats available to the biggest passengers in Seoul each year are the top three seats available every year, as it passes by Duksung Women's University, Kookmin University, Yonsei University and other major bus stops. It was four o'clock in the morning. An engineer with white gloves started running. Before the stores open, the only things that reflect the gloomy dawn are the bus headlights and the streetlights. Only taxis and business trucks sometimes run on the road. Meeting the Nightbus is basic. The bus is the foot of those who go to work in the morning. Passengers who were waiting for a bus got into the car from the entrance of Doseonsa Temple in Ui-dong, the first stop. He is armed with padding and a mask, and he carries a backpack on his back. The first car in the third stop became a full-ringed long bus that looked like a liar. "" Hello, "" and "" Thank you, "" passengers and drivers say hello to each other. Of the more than 40 apparently well-looked-looking passengers, only two close their eyes and sleep in the first car. A joyful voice filled the bus. Kim Chang-soo : The first stage of Hanjiyeon's journey is usually reserved for commuters. Passengers cleaning, leaving restaurants, construction workers, etc. Some of them work the early shift. Most of them are in their 50s or 60s. "" The first car is full of energy and is full of energy, "" Kim said. "" If you drop by, some passengers will have a snack. "" And everyone is less comfortable.

"" Well, let's go to work, "" they said, adding, "" Let's go, "" adding, "" I have a full cry of passengers and one of 143. Around 4:52 a.m., a fast driver slid open the front window.

"If the U.S. dollar is not raised fast enough to export more U.S. dollars and the exchange rate falls due to the pressure on the U.S. dollar, the Korean won will continue to fall by 1050 won and the U.S. dollar by 2018. Exports of semiconductors are expanding the current account surplus, and the threat from the U.S. dollar designated by the Korean foreign exchange authorities are contributing to the lowering of the won-dollar exchange rate. It is predicted that the won-dollar exchange rate could go down to 1050 won per barrel, the first trial period, if there is no surprise. A decline in the won-dollar exchange rate is partly a burden on exporters, but gives the Bank of Korea little time to sharply raise its key interest rate. When the U.S. Federal Reserve System (Fed) makes three rate hikes a year a reality, Korea and the U.S. will face a reversal in their basic rates starting in the first half, and fears of capital outflow will arise. However, if the won-dollar exchange rate continues to fall, the central bank can take a breather by increasing its domestic inflow tax of foreign capital to profit. The Bank of Korea's economic statistics system on October 31 closed at 1070.50 on July 28, the lowest level in more than three years since Oct. 10, 2014. The average exchange rates for November and December fell 26.66 and 16.87 won, respectively, to reaffirm the sharp decline in the final chapter of 2017. Compared with the closing price of 1207.70 won in 2016, the value of the won increased 12.8 percent in just one year. This is due to the fact that North Korea's missile provocations have decreased since October and that the Fed is not moving up rates as fast as it should be, resulting in a weaker dollar. In addition to the improvement in the growth rate from the current account surplus, the central bank`s signing of a currency swap agreement with key trading partners in November also helped to strengthen the won`s value. Experts say the won`s strength is not likely to weaken in the coming year. If you consider the current account surplus of South Korea`s GDP as 3 percent abroad, the semiconductor trade surplus could fall to 10-17 percent, said Kim Jung-sik, economics professor at Yonsei University. As the central bank announced its intent to be cautious of raising the key interest rate this year, Lee restated in his New Year message that prolonged loosening of monetary policies may deepen the financial imbalance. Aside from the key interest rate, the market rate is likely to rise early this year due to the possibility of entering the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) with an increase in the amount of money issued by the U.S. Treasury.Woo Sung-kyu, Graphics.com = Lee Seok-hee [Facebook] [Taehangso High!

"▽ Furious society, don't be mad. 〓 If you touch the small cart, # 1, you can stare at it and you can say, ' Bureaucracy. ' Mr.Why has the Republic of Korea become such an angry society? How can we not all live with a big smile and soothe our anger in the New Year, as the actor Hyun Dae-cheol (50) looks? Hong In-gi, a reporter in October 2017 in front of a large supermarket checkout counter in Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, where shoppers were in a rush for Chuseok, Seoul, a white-haired man in his 60s and older looked like a man in his fifties. That is why when a man in his 60s hit the back of a man who was leading the way, he mumbled, "" I, I am. "" A man in his 60s who heard the abuse even pretended to hit at the age of "" Do you want to kill the young XX? "" Even for employees who tried to stop themselves, the young man said, "" Why am I XX with me? "" As constant noise gathered around him, the man cursed even the eyes he saw. He could not keep his temper until he left the mart. We live in an ' angry society ' surrounded by people who are prone to fits of rage. She gets angry at her family members who worry about their daily lives, at work, at work friends, and at the casual encounters in public places such as a street or a supermarket. Even if cell phones don't work properly, and they don't have anything to look for, many people can not stop their political anger from growing out of the news or Internet postings. An impatient and impulsive society, indignant with the little things, is now the nation of 2018. According to a 2015 survey by the Korean Neuropsychological Association, more than half (52 percent) of Korean adults are suffering from poor anger control. More than one in 10 people are at risk of suffering from shock control disorders, or shock control disorders, that need treatment. What on earth are they, or why, angry at? The scene of an angry Republic of Korea, which Korean newspaper reporters encountered around at the end of 2017, was as fierce and fierce as the biting cold. A bus stopped in front of the world`s most affluent city of Goyang, Gyeonggi Province on July 13 due to a fight between two passengers. Regardless of the surrounding requests, a woman in her early 30s raised her voice and said, "" What are you looking at? "" as the fight began with a man in his late 30s who looked at her with disapproval. For more than 20 minutes, the two exchanged abuse. As they ended up in a shoulder-buttery struggle, the woman yelled, "" Call the police "" and the driver ended up driving to the nearby block. Police were out but he jumped in front of the bus to start again and stirred up a storm, saying `` I can't go now because I don't deserve to do this. '' At least one person a day visits the Earth with these little arguments, said the unit's inspector general who moved to the Earth. "" I'm freezing, XX. I'm calling the police, "" said a 50-something male passenger in late November at Mapo station, in Seoul, in a fight with a bus driver, stepping on the steps in the front door. It was because I waited for the bus but did not open the door. The driver repeatedly apologized "" I didn't see you, I'm sorry, "" but he insisted. Despite the changing traffic lights, the man remained at bay, and some passengers on the bus said, "" Get in or get out. "" Then the situation ended. In crowded public transportation such as buses and subways, disputes over what is called explosive anger are frequent. Some even say that they are afraid to use public transportation. Uijeongbu subway Line 1 at home by a college student who lives in Seoul yunseowon and grandfather who swear that they don't have to seat (22), who said concessions, a short skirt.That "" even with a stick right. "" So, when the subway, while the other compartments or even avert their eyes if you wouldn't smell right. we're going to head., to commit it. Recently, at an organic grocery store in southern Seoul, parking fees were 1,000 won, causing the store to turn sour. A man in his fifties was furious when he was told that there was no parking fee in front of the store, but the basement car park had to pay 1,000 won to park. The man did not even have enough time to yell at the staff, so he called the number of the car parked in front of the store and found the car owner. A 40-something woman said, "" I couldn't park my car in front of the store because of you. "" And then she took it out on dry customers, throwing her head and saying, "" That's rude. "" The man left the store with repeated apologies from his employees, but he shouted "" Live straight "" to the end. Employees who work in these stores call themselves "" bounders. "" Around the same time, a convenience store in Incheon had used violence by throwing things away because customers had requested "" a plastic bag "". A 23-year-old owner said, "" I always asked a customer who bought two bottles of soju to pay me 20 won for them, so I threw them to the ground and often reacted very aggressively. "" Workers at the store are afraid of the alarm going off with a tag. If the alarm sounds and the customer is not able to leave, the next time the bag is scanned, the next time the customer scuffs at the bag, it will make nine. A 25-year-old working at a cosmetics store in Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, had to kneel down in front of customers due to an alarm. When the customer said, "" I'm sorry to sound the alarm, but can I see your bag? "" the customer dropped the contents of the bag on the floor abruptly. "" If I didn't steal, get down on your knees and apologize. "" The alarm was sounded because the customer bought the book online and had the tags attached to it. Although he apologized repeatedly, he forced his knees to roll. ▽ Furious urge / 207-12-29 = Except for the time spent sleeping at the Korean daily office and drinking party, the workplace that spends the most time each day is also the place where anger explodes. A 33-year-old worker at an export company in Seoul recently talked to a manufacturing company over a delivery schedule, and suddenly stormed out of the office door with a loud curse. A 36-year-old senior Yoon took Chung to the lounge and said, "" Keep your manners up when the office is in the same room, "" and instead asked, "" What are you up to? "" A new dental technician came in and knocked over the table while having a year-end dinner at a meat restaurant when he said, We don`t cook properly. Not long after the party began, each had only one or two beers per person, not enough to be drunk. Another dental hygienist who was in the same place at the time often used to say, "" I wasn't good enough to beat the guy's hand but I was angry because I couldn't stand the cut out my toe, and I used the excuse that I was so angry with the pile of meat. ""Experts say that the background of the "" blow-up "" anger is not only individual tendencies but also sociocultural factors. In addition to being impatient or unqualified, social frustration is the main cause of the outrage. Choi Seok-hyeon, a researcher at the Gyeonggi Development Institute, wrote the journal, "" We have found that the desire for a better life can be accounted for by structural issues that are increasingly difficult to achieve as obstacles to social inequality. "" To achieve immediate profit, the solution of "" Men with a Great Voice "" has led to complaints in such a way as showing extreme indignation at public institutions, department stores and restaurants.

Exercise therapist Joo Jeong-hwa, who runs the 10-year overweight classroom, says, People who visit overweight classrooms today are younger and heavier than they were 10 years ago, and they feel overweight in their lives.According to the National Health Insurance Corporation's report titled, "" The Obesity White Paper, "" which analyzes the results of health examination by 13.95 million adults over the age of 19, recorded 33.6 percent of overweight patients in 2016.The obesity rate for men was 41.3 percent, much higher than that of women (23.7 percent). It is the first time that the percentage of obesity among Korean men has entered the 40-somethings scale, up from 29 percent in 2006. Especially, the obesity problem was serious among men in their 30s and 40s. The average age of men was well above the average, with 46.3 percent in their 30s, 45.9 percent in their 40s and 42 percent in their 50s. The obesity rate of middle and high school students also increased steadily from 8.2 % in 2005 to 12.8 % in 2016.Oh Sang-woo, director of the Korea Obesity`s School of Obesity, said, As our eating habits Westernized, eating high-fat, high-calorie foods, and exercising less and more, we gain weight.◇ Obesity is more dangerous than smoking or drinking, and as the number of overweight patients increases, the cost to our society is also soaring. According to the Health Insurance Policy Institute, the amount of money lost due to obesity reached 9.1506 trillion won in 2015. It is equivalent to the social costs of drinking and smoking (as of 2013, 9.4524 trillion won and 7.1258 trillion won). Obesity is as high a risk of adult diseases as smoking and drinking. Obese patients have a risk of diabetes 2.5 times higher and high blood pressure twice as high as those who weigh normal.The World Health Organization (WHO) calls obesity a ' new infection of the 21st century. ' Moon Chang-jin, head of the Korea Health Insurance Corp.'s obesity policy committee, said, It is not the time for WHO to say obesity is not just a form of obesity but a form of illness, as it should be seen as a "" personal health problem. ""☞ The BMI (BMI) weight (kg) divided by the square of the keys (m), for example a person with a weight of 70 kg and a height of 170 cm will have a BMI of 24.2 (70 ^ 1.7 ²). In Korea, BMI of 25 or higher is considered to be overweight and 30 or more is considered very obese.[Choi Won-Woo Press.com] - Copirits ilbo Chosun Ilbo & Chosun.com, No Transporting and Redistribution - 2018 has begun.

"Buses Are Going in and out of the Jongno Central Bus Line, which connects the Dongdaemun intersection of Sejongdaero intersection in Sejongdaero intersection that opened on the morning of July 31. Bus users and drivers of hihong@yna.co.kr are expected to use the bus faster and safer ... It is more likely that they will get to work faster than usual … The last minute of the year is finished, and some of the buses will be opened for the Jongno-Dongdaemoon Central Bus Intersections on July 31. ▽ End of News.com = Lee Hyo-seok (Yonhap News Agency) = People expressed their satisfaction and hope on July 31, saying, "" The bus has become faster on the first day of the exclusive bus service in Jongno, Seoul. "" Seoul City opened its own bus lane 2.8 kilometers from the intersection of Sejongdaero and Heunginjimun Gate on the same day. The city said it completed Dongseochang, a central bus lane that passes from Gyeongin and Maporo to Mangu-Wangsan, east and west of Seoul. At around 3:00 p.m., buses running on the Jongno Central Bus lane ran "" cool "" without stopping. Bus stops at road stops and then cuts in to change lanes to one or two lanes, leaving the scene of colluding with the cars completely gone. People who met at the central bus stop said in unison, "" I am satisfied that the bus runs smoothly on the central bus. "" Office worker Hong (31) said, "" My home is in Chong-ro, Mapo High School, and I think it will definitely reduce my commuting time when I ride it today. "" But I found it uncomfortable to do so because of the rush hour. Some said that the bus station reduced the risk of accidents when getting or getting off the train. Kim (age 57, female), who came from Seongnam, said, "" At road stops, when several buses are left behind, the bus stops were not at the stop ; they were at the flower beds or at the fence, so the bus stop was safe. "" Bus driver A (63), who ran the main bus only on the main route through Yanghwa and Mangouro, praised the opening day, saying, I`m able to ensure on time.Lee Hyo-seok, a reporter at the Seoul Yonhap News Agency, opened on July 31, when the exclusive bus lane for the Jongno Central Bus Line opened, while the regular bus stop near Dongdaemun Gate was cool.However, it was not clear whether the car was able to stop at hyo@yna.co.kr (last year), but it was rather stuck with regular cars, which decreased from eight lanes to six lanes due to the opening of the exclusive bus lanes. The Jongno 1-ga district is usually a little more clogged than Sunday, said an official at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's National Traffic Information Center, referring to the completion of the central bus stop and preparation for the Baechingak Bell event. Some citizens complained that the opening caused the bus routes to change or increase the distance it takes to walk. "" As soon as I get off the road, the bus stop is India, and I think I'll have to wait for the crosswalk again, "" says Bae. "" It's a little confused and my station is in need. "" Some citizens looked around or pointed out the lack of comfort and security as they could not find a crossing because they had not yet completed the pedestrian crossing at the bus stop. Every central bus stop posted a notice asking for your understanding, saying, I will complete the tasks as soon as possible. Police dispatched traffic police and exemplary drivers to prepare for the safety accidents.Lee Hyo-seok, reporter for the Seoul Yonhap News Agency, said yesterday, "" People still cross the street near Jonggak Station in Jongno, Seoul.hyo@yna.co.kr (end of December 31, 2001) ▶ Report and inquiry by reporter and 1:1 chatting on the trade surplus with the U.S. $ 22.7 billion in U.S. trade surplus with the U.S. last year as a result of sluggish export and protected trade. It is the first time that the surplus with the U.S. is less than $ 20 billion since the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was signed in 2012. According to the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy on July 1, the U.S. trade balance with the U.S. decreased 22.7 percent year-on-year to reach $ 17.17 billion. The trade deficit with the United States has been above $ 20 billion since it hit $ 15.08 billion in 2012. The trade volume has decreased significantly because imports of major export items, automobiles and auto parts, have shown a sluggish pace, while imports from natural gas and semiconductor manufacturing equipment have soared significantly. From January to December 20 last year, cumulative exports to the United States rose 4.2 percent to $ 666.67 billion. The U.S. economy has continued to recover due to job security, increased consumption and improved industrial output, but exports of auto, car parts, and wireless communications equipment have decreased. In particular, steel exports have declined as the U.S. imposed anti-dumping duties against Korean steel products. Korea`s sluggish auto strategy model and protective trade measures hurt steel exports last year, dramatically reducing the surplus with the United States, an official at the Commerce Ministry said. By item, sluggish sales at the end of the day have led to a decline in car sales (- 3.9 percent) and falling exports of car parts (- 156 percent). Major export item, wireless communication equipment, also saw its sales of cellular components in the country grow and its rival rival new products release 17.6 percent less than last year. Revenues during the same period rose 18.1 percent year-on-year to $ 49.25 billion. Imports of natural gas and other petroleum products soared 121.9 percent and 102.8 percent of imports for semiconductor manufacturing. Indeed, the U.S. is increasing the pressure on major countries that produce imported goods, including Korea, by imposing a series of safeguards on them. The U.S. Department of Commerce imposed an anti-dumping duty on cold rolled steel tubes made in Korea from 5.10 to 48.00 %. The anti-dumping pre-tariff duties against carbon-alloy steel rods was recently raised to 40.8 percent from 10.09 percent. It is also possible that the U.S. will impose a new type of import regulation by investigating the security effects of U.S. steel imports.Trade is expected to remain tense in the future. In the revision talks scheduled for this month, the United States is targeting Korea`s major export item, automobiles and auto parts. The ministry earlier raised the possibility of accelerating the removal of Korea`s remaining tariffs and adjusting the duties on major items to address the trade imbalance between the two countries, particularly in improving market access, said the ministry. In fact, the U.S. raised the value-added standard of the automobile sector to 85 percent from 62.5 percent and demanded the use of 50 percent of U.S. parts in the free trade agreement with North America. The government plans to respond in consideration of the company`s production structure. Reflecting the difficulties of the industry, the ministry will also actively ask for improvements in the standard of origin of Korean industries of interest. The ministry said it plans to push to reflect the issues of our interest with the aim of enhancing reciprocity and achieving a balanced profit. sypark@newsis.com> Anchoriston > Today (31st), there was another unfortunate incident.

"The Korean Central News Agency's Kim Jong Il and the North's Kim Jong Il Museum of National Defense have also announced a plan to present a "" U.S. ' approach to improving inter-Korean relations. "" / Yonhap news agency's chairman, Kim Jong-un, did not hide his intention to turn the situation around, saying, "" We can send a delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and open dialogue between the authorities of the two Koreas to do so. "" But at the same time, Kim is closely watching what he intends to do to change the situation by threatening that the nuclear button is always on my desk at work.North Korea appears to have made a surprise offer for a breakthrough when its economy has significantly declined due to growing sanctions on the North. In particular, it is possible to develop nuclear and missile technologies by stalling the dialogue phase. We should step up the project to mass produce and deploy nuclear warheads and ballistic rockets, Kim said, while repeating the need to complete nuclear weapons. This means that the two sides could attempt to launch an inter-continent ballistic missile (ICP-14), which was launched in an attempt to complete the incomplete nuclear weapon.Koh Yu-hwan, an adviser at the Seoul Economic Daily University, said, "" Nuclear button references are meant to receive U.S. nuclear weapons because they can strike the U.S., which is supposed to have the rudimentary ability to confirm through experiments. "" The ministry also analyzed that although North Korea did not specifically suggest any further provocations, it will continue to upgrade its nuclear capability.Some analyze that North Korea is trying to make a difference between the U.S. and Korea by making a surprise proposal to the South Korean government while avoiding any special comments on the U.S. and South Korea. Kim said, We must abandon all nuclear training exercises with foreign powers to set fire to this land and dye the sacred soil with blood, and collect all of the activities that would attract U.S. nuclear equipment and invading forces. As a specific condition for the improvement of inter-Korean relations, the two sides called for the suspension of the Korea-U.S. military drill and the suspension of the deployment of U.S. strategic assets to the Korean Peninsula.In particular, it is also possible that North Korea will ask for the lifting of sanctions, the resumption of economic cooperation, and humanitarian aid to the North by taking advantage of the participation in the Pyeongchang Olympics. If the government agrees, it could face friction with the Trump administration, which emphasizes the highest levels of pressure and sanctions on North Korea. North Korea will put a greater weight on its participation in the Pyeongchang Games but will decide whether to take part in the Games based on the attitude of the South, said the National Security Strategy Institute, but if Seoul and Washington refrain from launching any further provocation before the Olympics, the training session will not resume.③ North Korea will improve its relationship with the South Korean government before attempting to talk to the United States, "" some view. Kim said, We are a responsible nuclear power that loves peace, a country that will not use nuclear weapons unless its aggressive rivals violate our nation`s sovereignty and interests. This is interpreted as a sign that they will not make any preemptive provocation for the time being. Some also point out that North Korea has controlled its criticism of the U.S. in comparison to its New Year message.So far, North Korea has made a `` unilateral courtship '' of communicating directly with the United States except for South Korea, but it is only the U.S. that changed its pressure and sanctions tactics to come back./ Seoul Economic Daily News, Park Hyo-jung.
