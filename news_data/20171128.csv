The Indonesian news agency raised an alarm in Bali during the last day of the AFP. Volcanic experts at Oxford University in Britain, Professor David Files, described the current state of the Agung volcano as "" a small explosion that is emerging at this time, with high-temperature gas, molten rock fragments, or volcanic ash. "" Geologists from Australia's Adelaide University Mark Tingay said, We continue to see volcanic eruptions of Mount Agung, which began Saturday (July 25). Smoke is going up to the height of 3,000 meters, said Park. `` The eruption is now more serious, and has moved on. Viscous lava can trap compressed gas here, which could potentially lead to an explosion, '' he said. Many experts say that the recent activity on the volcano Agung resulted in the loss of about 1,600 people and the release of approximately 1 billion tons of pyroclastic material, reducing the average global temperature by 0.2 to 0.3 degrees in the previous year. Based on what was observed in 1963, Professor Files pointed out that the current situation is quite similar to that of the early days of differentiation. It is likely to explode. But it takes days or weeks to develop. Professor David Rothery of the British Open also expects a big change to occur soon. `` The Agung volcano will eventually cause a major eruption, which has been concerned about for the past few weeks, '' he diagnosed. French volcanologist Jacques-Marie Bardinjes said, "" All the warning lights are red, "" and "" My Indonesian colleagues and I believe it will erupt. "" Gray smoke is erupting from the volcano in Bali, Indonesia.■ AFP : Some academics are cautious about news 1. Professor Karman Solana, a volcanologist at Portsmouth in the U.K., said, "" It's hard to say at this point that the eruption is going to go on, and he said, "" If volcanic activity could grow rapidly, it could go off into a major eruption. "" Some say that the worst-case scenario can be realized. `` The worst scenario is for a slightly bigger explosion than 1963, '' said Professor Files. `` The evacuation areas should be extended to 10 to 12 kilometers from the volcano, '' he said. The evacuation will not have to be extended to the entire island, it added.If the summit of Agung Volcano explodes, the effects include volcanic ash, lava flows, and the impact of tourism, the main source of income on Bali Island. Professor Rothery said, "" Volcanic ash in the air is a respiratory hazard and kills crops. We can also break down the roof and turn it into a very destructive mudslides when it rains. Volcanic ash is not toxic, but is a serious danger to airplanes. Because all planes land at Bali International Airport. The ash accumulated on the runway can cause aircraft taking off and landing to slip out of control. Guy Gratton, visiting professor at the University of Cranfield in Britain, said, "" The biggest danger is the engine, "" and pointed out that "" it hardens the turbine blades of engines and therefore reduces efficiency and could potentially stop. "" Professor Mike Burton of Manchester University in the U.K. warned that a large eruption would cause a "" hot rock events "" along the slopes of the volcano. And when the monsoon season sets in, mud and ash can be mixed together, devastating land and damaging infrastructure around the volcano, he pointed out.As the Agung volcano in Bali, Indonesia shows signs of an explosion, neighboring people are living in shelters."
"Prince Harry and Prince Mary's Countermarket to Consignment and Divorce Scandal over Prince Edward VIII and Prince Charles is now re-married in church only three years ago. Prince Harry (left) and Hollywood actress Margan Makrey stand before reporters to announce their engagement on July 27. Foreign media are evaluating that "" the British royal family is moving away from the past, "" as Queen Elizabeth II allowed to marry Mark, a divorced woman. Reuters reported on the same day, "" The British public opinion has changed over the past few decades, but the royal family has been bound by Christian values. "" Claudia Joseph, a British royal author, also said, "" It is less than 100 years old, and the royal family has changed enormously. "" Public awareness of divorce changed early, but the royal family was unable to escape from conservative thought. She also went through numerous scandals and tragedies to adhere to traditional values for marriage. The most famous scandal was Edward VIII and Mrs Simpson's ' forbidden love. ' Prince Edward VIII of England announced in a radio speech in 1936 that he was giving up his throne for a divorced woman, duchess Windsor and winzer. After 11 months on the throne, he went to marry an American divorcee, Mrs Simpson. The Church of England then forbade the remarriage of the divorced person. Even when the two met, Mrs. Simpson was married with a second marriage in mind. Although it is now called the Love Story of the century, the romance between the two men rocked the British royal family, the church, and the government. The prime minister threatened to resign, while Australia and Canada said they would leave the Commonwealth. Eventually, Edward VIII took over the throne from his brother, leaving a speech saying, I knew I couldn't do my king's duty without the help of a loved woman. The couple, both dubbed Windsor Castle and the duchess of Windsor, went to France in a chase and married. Princess Margaret, the divorced mother of Queen Elizabeth II, who had refused to give up her love. [Central Photo], a 16-year-old divorced man asked Princess Margaret to marry him but was unable to overcome the opposition of the whole of Britain. In 1953, the whole U.K. was in a roar with love from Princess Margaret, the brother of Queen Elizabeth II. Princess Margaret wanted to marry a divorced man, too. His opponents were Peter Town Sand, a former military officer of his father, George VI. Princess Margaret, who was proposed to him as a divorced 16 year old, asked for permission from Queen Elizabeth II according to the law. The Queen did not answer immediately, however, and the government and the church threatened to give up not only the possibility of her succession to the throne but also her status and property when Princess Margaret married the town sand. The media criticized it as an unthinkable marriage that would disgrace the royal family and its Christian values. The royal family even sent Town Sand to Brussels, Belgium. After two years of desperate opposition, Princess Margaret saw through the BBC that "" I could not separate myself from my obligations and marriage, and I decided not to consider this as my first choice, "" and said that "" I would marry Peter. "" Queen Herry never remarried Prince Charles, and the divorce of Prince Charles and late Princess Diana in 1996 was a huge scandal surrounding the royal wedding and divorce. Shortly after 15 years of marriage, which she had known to be fairy tales, Princess Diana died in a tragic car accident in Paris, France in 1997. Prince Charles (right) and Camilla Parker Bowles, remarried in 2005. Central Photo : And in 2005, Prince Charles remarried to divorced woman, Camila Parker Bowles. She was the long liaison. However, their wedding could not take place at the church. It was because of Queen Elizabeth II's strong religious beliefs and wedding values, which were also the head of the Church of England. The Queen did not even attend their wedding at Windsor Castle. After the wedding, he attended only the ' blessing services ' held at the royal chapel in Windsor Castle. Some commented after the service that the Queen's reception was held, but some reluctantly consented that only finger food was served, but still reflected the Queen's reluctance to marry. It was only three years ago that the Church of England formally allowed people to remarry in the Church. Even he imposed the condition "" only on exceptions. "" "" The Queen must have been in a dilemma when Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles married, "" Prince Charles told Reuters, "" Charles opened the way for his son Harry.

The Australian government has refused to make public despite repeated requests for the release of the 2008 video, for fear of worsening relations with Japan.Sea Shepard, a marine conservation organization, has brutally captured a whaling ship yesterday in an attempt to capture the whale. In this clip taken by customs officials, a harpoon was fired from a whaling ship, is set precisely to the whale, and blood is drawn from the whale, which is stripped of its flesh. Sea Shepherd started getting the video in 2012 based on the Freedom of Information Act, and after five long years of fighting, they finally got it. Australian media outlets reported that the video was shown and tried to keep it secret, saying it would harm relations with Japan. But Sea Shepherd has been opposed to taking sides with the poacher for his diplomatic advantage by saying that Australians want to protect whales and stop the annual whale hunt. Eventually, the fight ended when the Australian Intelligence Service recently gave the Ministry of Culture, Information and Communication an order to release the video. Jeff Hansen, Director of the Australian chapter of Sea Shepherd said, "" This video has been shown to be extremely ruthless, brutal, and meaningless death, of an animal, both wonderful and magnificent. "" The Embassy of Japan in Australia told the Sydney Morning Herald, their whale research program is carried out in compliance with the International Whaling Convention (ICRW).

"▽ The grandmother and mother bought a house with cash, but since the gift tax was not paid and the amount was taken into account by a down contract and the doctor kept the money in his mother-in-law's account, the public service doctor in charge is now 31 years old. However, he lives in a luxury apartments in Daegu, and recently purchased apartments scheduled to be rebuilt in Seocho-gu, Seoul, and new apartments in Yongsan-gu. It cost an estimated one billion won to buy two homes and to finance the rent of an apartment in Daegu alone. Where did he come in with such a large sum of money? The National Tax Service (NTS) found that the payment for Mr. A's real estate transaction was made between his mother and his grandmother. He received more than 1 billion won in cash from his mother and grandmother and spent it on rent and housing sales, but paid no gift tax. It was even revealed that he received cash from his mother regularly and used it as a living expenses. The National Tax Service announced on July 28 that it conducted a tax investigation into real estate transaction in areas where housing prices are skyrocketing and charged a gift tax on the cash received from his mother and grandmother.Another case was discovered in which the CEO of an illustration firm, "" Real Estate Speculation-Doctor Tax Investigation (PG), "" stole corporate income into personal accounts to purchase real estate. B (49), who runs a corporation, missed out on corporate and income taxes by accepting some of its income as individual accounts. He was confirmed to have purchased three homes in Gangnam in his own name with the money he embezzled, and finally put his name on the tax collection list. It is also known that the practice of down payment of the sale price of a house to reduce the transfer income tax is still the same. C (47), who lives in Gwangju, bought and sold apartments more than 10 times for speculative purposes, including the ones in Busan, Dongtan 2, and the innovative cities with high premiums to sell apartments. He wrote down his transfer income each time he made transactions with a down contract and purchased houses and land from Dongtan 2 New Town and Sejong City again with his laid-off returns. A 33-year-old from Busan got caught hiding the sale price of her apartment in her mother-in-law's bank account via a down contract. E, who runs an authorized brokerage business in Busan, reduced taxes by registering a real estate brokerage office in the name of four acquaintances and declaring the amount of income. He also hid the import amount by taking real estate brokerage commission in cash and not issuing cash receipts. It was also discovered that the relatives of conglomerates, which should be subsidiaries under fair trade laws, grew up on the basis of work from their subsidiaries. The subcontractor underscored the tax amount by taking advantage of small businesses despite being affiliated with a large company. The chairman of a large company, K, was also found to have overlooked giving billions of won in gift tax to his children as a gift at face value from stock he trusted with his executives and employees to succeed in management. As for irregular gift acts that are prevalent in some areas of society, we will collect cases through various channels to strengthen our ability to respond to them on a cleaning basis and on a drafting scale, an official said. rock@yna.co.kr"
"; Professor Lee Jong-hee of Nushise-&amp;Oh Dong-Hyun, an elementary school student, spent 15 million won for payment of a mobile game payment item. The item was paid by credit card of the parents associated with the smartphone. After being caught late, the parent asked the game company for a refund, but was only able to return 8 million won that they paid within 65 days. B, who has a 10-year-old child, found out that his cellular phone had been charged 205,000 won. It turned out that while their children were using the mobile game, they paid for the item without the consent of B. In response, he asked the game company for a refund, saying, "" My child, who is a minor, made a random payment without asking for consent. "" However, the game agency refused, and asked the Korea Consumer Agency for help. The case of Miss A and Mr. B is just the tip of the iceberg. Countless families are suffering from the gambling children. Families with boys and their adolescent sons are especially strong at a much more sensitive time. As the players are hungry and preoccupied with games, many complain that they are out of control. We have seen elementary school students spend 15 million won and high school girls 40 million won on stochastic items, Sohn Hye-won, said in a parliamentary audit. A stochastic item is an item that provides various items at random to the probability in return for the consumption of game money or game points. They are called "" items with a bootlight "" or "" item with a capsule "". The Korea Center for Gambling Problems has been conducting preventive training by designating stochastic items as "" a typical gambling element in a game. "" However, the game industry is causing social problems as it is introducing stochastic items, even to the games enjoyed by children, and inducing a fee. According to game industry sources on 28th, the odds of using Lineage M (12 year olds / teenage users) by NC Soft, World Junior High-Complex by Netmarable Games ' Lineage Revolution 2 (12 year olds) by Nexon, and Dark Urvens ' NCsoft originally launched Lineage M as its 12-year-old user, but released an app-level non-use application last July. The item exchange is a system that supports people to buy or sell items within a game using a diamond, a pay-for-cashable item. Dias can be obtained through payment within Lineage M game. You must pay 3300 won (including VAT) to purchase 120 diamonds in minimum payment units. NCsoft will charge two percent of its fees for each item traded on the exchange. In Lineage M, the probability of pulling a weapon called the Kurtz sword is 0.0001 percent from Ken Lauel's weapon box. It is similar to the chance of winning the Lotto 2. Even though the Lotto is worth 1000 won, it costs 1,200 diamonds (33,000 won) at a time to get the weapon out. Netmable Games also saw its 12-year-old Lineage II Revolution get suspended by the Game Management Commission. The problem was the blue diamond, which is used as a commodity on the item exchange. The blue diamond, which is paid for in the grades used by teenagers, stirred controversy over gambling. Netmarble then added a new diamond, called Green Dia, to the item exchange that can only be obtained through playing games. The probability type item is selected by the "" blue diamond "" as usual, and the actual transaction item is done by the "" green diamond. "" The structure of allowing teenagers to pour money into stochastic items is unchanged. Nexon also received a flurry of criticism in 2015 when it launched its collectible "" pull-out "" event in its online role playing game (RPG), a 12-year-old user. It was an event to purchase a product called Lucky Bingo box with a reward item and a number between 1 and 25, and offer character decoration when a figure is collected and the ice cap is finished. However, he was criticized for encouraging gamers to pick up the same number of players because it could double. The problem is that it is like getting a "" rare thing in the sky "" for gamers to get what they want out of a stochastic item. Nevertheless, the game industry says it is not gambling because it announces its odds and has no so-called "" Boom. "" On the other hand, gamers protest that items that have been extracted with a large amount of money are in the general rating and are in fact "" gross. "" A bigger problem is that mobile games do not have a payment limit for teenagers. As a result, teenagers with poor self-control continue to make payments until they get the items they want. It is not hard to find cases in which teenagers access games using their parents ' names. Even when children surreptitiously pay for paid items with their parents ' credit cards, such payments are not possible. According to the 2015 Games Overmore Event by the Korea Creative Content Agency, 20.5 percent of elementary school students, 46.7 percent of middle school students and 55.2 percent of high school students have purchased paid items. In this regard, voices are growing to say that the probability type of items should be regulated. Currently, PC online games have a monthly payment limit of 500,000 won for adults and 70,000 for minors. However, the game industry insists that the payment limit should be raised even as a result of harming the game industry. Under these circumstances, it appears hard for the game industry to limit the payment limits of mobile games themselves. Meanwhile, parents of underage children are complaining increasingly. According to the Korea Consumer Agency, the number of mobile-game service-related consultations during consumer consultations rose 50.3 percent year-on-year to 233 in September. Major consultations were called for a refund due to the cancellation of games paid by minors. Even e-commerce sessions were conducted with 177 mobile game services, up 172.3 percent from the previous year. As a result, the company was ranked third on the list of items that were included in the e-commerce list. In particular, consumers are complaining about the Lineage M of NCsoft recently. This is because they ignored customers who demanded refunds, such as withdrawal of subscriptions after purchasing items. According to the Korea Consumer Agency, the number of NCSoft`s complaints counseling sessions at the Consumer Consultative Center in Seoul, which began June 21 this year on the first day of Lineage M's launch, soared to 204. Compared to the number of cases in May, the number of such cases has risen significantly. NC Soft's Consumer Complaint Consultative Report showed that 69.1 % (141) answered "" withdrawal and refund of subscriptions "" after purchasing items. Following, the company accounted for 8.8 percent of cases in terms of ' quality ', ' misconduct ' and ' display and advertisement. ' Although many in the game industry recognize that mobile games need to be controlled by teenagers, just like PC online games, officials said that they do not have future policies. Another game industry official complained, We are trying to get away from the stochastic item system as much as possible, saying, If mobile games do not have stochastic items, what game companies are eating at all. odong85@newsis.com>"
"[Company should not be misled by the commission, consumer support group, and early public service warning against promo subscribers ...] The Korean Fair Trade Commission's General Assembly's kimchi seller should know better if it is found to have signed up for an uncertain contract. He paid 39,800 won per month as an automatic transfer, but recently asked B to cancel the contract. The company said, Among the monthly payments of 30,800 won, 30,450 won was monthly payments for refrigerators and 5,500 won was the monthly payment for pre-product products. The preliminary cancellation refund was about 90,000 won based on monthly payments made by pre-product agents, excluding fridge agents. I thought it was free because it was a gift, but when I was about to cancel it, I paid for the refrigerator payment instead of paying for the first item.As the electronic products sold by combining them with the premier-producing products, such as air conditioners, refrigerators and massage chairs, a growing number of consumers are complaining about the expanding sales patterns of their businesses. As a result, the Fair Trade Commission and the Korea Consumer Agency issued a warning on July 28 against damages related to early service.The warning is intended to raise awareness of the damages filed by consumers through the Consumer Relations Center (National Single Number 1372) and the FTC's public inquiry office, and thus promote the cases of consumer damages to the public.Major damages disclosed by the Fair Trade Commission and the Consumer Agency occurred when an electronics store guided its early goods to installment savings and paid in installment savings, resulting in a majority of e-products being subscribed to. For premarket-producing products, the subscription can be withdrawn within 14 days from the date of receiving the contract, and for electronic products according to the installment transaction method within seven days from the day of receiving the electronic products. However, if the consumer cancels the early contract with an installment period such as electronic goods remaining, the discounts on such products may be lost or the remaining installment may be paid in full.Consumers should therefore pay more attention to the terms of their contract, not to be misled by the word "" giveaways "" or to consider the monthly payment as small amounts of money that they receive.As damages occur due to the closing of the business of the business, consumers need to pay attention. If the subcontractor that the partner is affiliated with closes within the contract period (usually more than 10 years), the legally guaranteed damages are only 50 % of the amount paid. Instead of being misled by uncertain external contract conditions, the company should carefully examine the quality of service performance, financial soundness, and past law violations.Moreover, it is also necessary to pay attention to the damages caused by the damages caused by the mutual benefit union and demands for additional money at the funeral site.Although the top priority is to prevent consumer damages from being caused by the service, we will continue to make systematic efforts to expand the market and improve negative perception, said a commission official.What you see next door is a free comic strip and a gift batter!

The indoor thermometer on the shabby jeonset house outside Gohan-eup on July 15 was 10 degrees. In a room filled with cold air, I lived with nothing but a 60cm square. On the spots were cans of nuts with cigarette butts, a pack of cigarettes, and a lighter with the name of a pawnbroker on it. The house, which pays 600,000 won per month in security, was completely out of keeping with Park 10 years ago. He was a wealthy man with billions of won. He was a businessman from an elite dancer. He graduated from a dance department at a well-known private university in Seoul, class 80. He grew in abundance thanks to his father who owned a fruit wholesale business. After graduating from college, she worked as a professional dancer at Kangkae, a theater restaurant in the Walkerhill Hotel in Gwangjang-dong, Seoul. Hey-hee, a dance dancer and Park Young-hee in her wealthy dancing Hanbok, recalled "" in the mid-twenties "" and did not remember the exact time to shoot. Park Young-hee : After she got married, she moved to Japan in 1996. He succeeded in turning into a businessman. He has owned a Japanese barbecue, a massage parlor, and a pub for nine years. He touched a sizable sum of money. `` I don't think I've earned 10 billion, and I have billions of won, '' he said. He returned to Korea in 2004 and divorced two years later, but his standard of living has not changed significantly. The restaurant operated by Uijeongbu City, Gyeonggi-do, Korea's Yakjatang, Hop, and Gamjatang restaurants were doing well. The catastrophe that consumed his life happened at a totally unexpected moment. We have obtained more than 170 million won on the first day, Park Young-hee is entering the Walset house in Jeongseon.

When I lost a lot, I lost 20 to 30 million won a day, and usually 7 to 10 million won a day. Sometimes, he won more than 10 million won. However, it failed to keep up with the losing pace. It took less than a year to squander. In 2008, he moved to Taebaek, Gangwon Province. Thinking about it, I set up 20 minutes drive away from Kangwonderand thinking casino. After three months at the casino, he was forced to close all three stores. He explained that he could not even collect the royalties properly except for the restaurant's most profitable restaurant. Taebaek City went to casino about once every other day. When I started playing games at 10:00 a.m., I was out until 6:00 a.m. the next day.

"Min Young-kyu : As two children from a rural area of China were found to have traveled 80 kilometers to find their parents working in the city, they were found to have traveled 80 kilometers to an empty bus market in China, they were found to have lived in a public society. According to the Hong Kong South China Morning Post (SCMP) and the U.K. BBC on July 28 (local time), two boys aged 8 to 9 were suddenly reported missing in poor villages in southern China's Guangdong Province. They were found at a bus stop on their way to Guangdong on the same day. It is about 80 kilometers from school. Children found by guards in hiding in the narrow area of the bus floor were covered in mud while hanging on the bus that ran for about three hours. Among the roads that thin children have been hanging on, the 4.7km long path is dangerous. `` It's amazing that you weren't hurt, '' the guards said. The children were leaving themselves to go and look for their parents who went to work in a city in Guangdong. Netizens were shocked when news of the incident was delivered with pictures via Chinese Twitter, Weibo. The photo spread with the article, "" It hurts my heart.

For these twisted minds, the devotion of auxiliaries in the Pohang Postpartum center, known as SBS reports, would have approached JugbI.

Government beehives, seeking to flourish, persecuted the pop artists to the core. Young people were frustrated when the government revealed the unfair recruitment process. The president of government who like playing house people empty the chest. All were deviations from those who were required to have stricter work ethics than anyone else. Nobody said, "" This is something I can't do for my professional conscience.

"" Lee responded, I heard inside the police officers (who worked in the special inspector's office) and found that it was a clear preference to transfer Woo's son to the driving force.

Lee also disclosed the circumstances under which he was pressured by Woo during his inspection. According to Lee, Wu called me right after the inspection started. If the media raises a question, it will be quiet next week, so why are you rushing to inspect it? Former Chief Executive Officer Woo said, "" When Lee released testimony against him, he briefly stared at Lee and looked uncomfortable. Lee hardly looked at Woo, who is sitting in the dock. Lee and Woo have worked together at Gyeongju District Public Prosecutors ' Office in 1992, so they are close to each other by being "" friendly. "" Wu was in charge of personnel verification as the senior civil affairs official when Lee was appointed as a special inspector in March 2015. However, the relationship between the two men has completely turned sour since their inspection last year. Former head of the prosecution, Woo Su-woo, is investigating for illegally inspecting former National Intelligence Service commissioner Lee. The investigation team of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office (team leader Park Chan-ho, second Deputy Director of the team) reported to Woo Thursday that he should attend as a suspect.Kwon Oh-hyuk, reporter hyuk@donga.com Even with its historical significance, some say that the improvement of Kosepe is needed.This year, Blff made a record-breaking online sale. The nation's top 100 online companies including Amazon sold $ 5 billion (5.4 trillion won) per day. The figure is an increase of 17 percent from last year. Korean office workers saw their orders surge during the same period. According to Moltale Corp., Korea`s largest overseas shipping agency, the number of orders for the Bluff period (July 24-25) reached 46,000. It is the largest increase ever, up 31 percent from 35,000 cases last year. Demand for online shopping continues on Cyber Monday after the end of the game, giving Korean market a hint."" The success of the Bluff is that it looks like it will cost you an exceptional price and a variety of products for up to 80 to 90 % off from the average 30 to 50 % in June. "" "" The sale and inventory of the event will go on with U.S. distributors and manufacturers.Meanwhile, Cosseppe's grades on the other hand, with the Korean version of Bluffs, were humble. Korea has hosted the government-led Kosepe this year for the third year, but the total sales of 100 retailers who participated from Sept. 28 to Oct. 31 amounted to only 10.36 trillion won. Even considering the gap in market size, it is less than half of Alibaba's daily sales of 168.2 billion yuan (28 trillion won).Store officials say the discount rate for Perfu's products has decreased by up to 90 percent, while the discount rate for Cosepe has been low by only 10 to 30 percent.The government led the way in copying the price discounts without considering the country`s distribution structure, another failure factor. In the U.S., department stores and discount stores bring in goods and directly sell them. If they are unable to sell their products by the end of the year, they will have to bear the burden of bad stock. Commercial users, who have the right to decide on prices, focus on exhausting them with aggressive discounts at the end of the year.Korean retailers, on the other hand, have a specific purchasing structure that manufacturers rent out space to sell their products. The distributors will only pay a fee and the price of the store will be decided by the stores. It is hard to expect a substantial discount as distributors are not burdened with inventory burden. In the end, manufacturers are required to actively participate in the discount but only about 30 percent of the participating companies have participated in the event.We needed to significantly increase the discount rate to make the Kosepe a Korean version of the block as the government intended, as well as engage in creating privately led distributors as well as environmental enterprises.

Lawyers for the campaign first showed the results of the tablet PC's emotion, which they concluded was Choi Soon-sil. Prosecutors submitted the results of their feelings to the court Friday. The prosecution claimed that Choi had never seen a tablet PC in court, but its state-run reply confirmed that Choi`s self-car photo was taken with the main tablet PC, and that it was false. Prosecutors also explained that the remaining information on the tablet PC is identical to Choi's, and that the e-mail account registered on the tablet was set up with the former name of Choi's daughter Chung Yoo-ra. In particular, Choi also stressed that the company`s claim of possible tablet manipulation has not been confirmed by the state-run tests. Lawyers continue to argue that Choi used a tablet PC, so why Kim Han-soo, a former presidential aide, is the one who set up the tablets?

"" The threat from a 25-year-old did not sound like a joke. Kim (24, female), who was terrified, left without saying anything. The two were once a couple on campus. Earlier this year, they had an unexpected child. I want to have an abortion, Kim said. The two men went under the knife for half and half. Until then, Kim could not imagine Park's threats. After a while the two separated. Park, who has become a ' ex-boyfriend ', told friends at school that Kim`s abortion was an act. Refusing to admit it, Kim visited Park last month to cry about defamation. Park then confronted me, saying, I will file a suit against abortion. Eventually, Kim took a semester off.○ In August 2012, the Constitutional Court ruled that abortions are constitutional, as the judgment on abortions shows. After the court's decision, the Dong-A Ilbo obtained and analyzed all 80 abortion related rulings made by the national courts during the past five years. The laws provide for the protection of abortions for women who have committed abortions (self-abortion), for surgical methods, and for men who have expressed their will to punish abortion outright. Abortions are allowed only on exceptional occasions, such as when the investigating agencies identify them as being pregnant by rape or when the parent has a genetic disorder.Many of the women were brought to justice at the request of their boyfriends or husbands. The abortion charges were being used by men to secure advantageous positions in divorce suits or custody disputes or to try to catch a girlfriend who asked to leave. Choi (29), who was fined 4 million won last year for abortion. After suffering from domestic violence by her husband (32), she decided to divorce and found out that she was pregnant. Her husband, who was in conflict with Choi over the amount of alimony, sued the gynecologist for an abortion with Choi. We know only a few of the facts about the abortion, including the woman involved, the surgeon who operated on it and the other man, so it is hard to get it out unless one of the three makes a complaint, a court official said. So most of the plaintiffs is male, or male, relatives. Women and doctors are punished if an abortion is discovered, but men avoid punishment if there is no clear evidence that they consented to the operation. Among women, the tacit trick is to "" do not tell a man of an abortion if he can afford it. "" However, many obstetricians refuse to operate unless their male counterparts check their consent. The court will impose a suspended sentence if the same abortion woman agrees with the male sex, but will punish her with a fine if she does not. Women who do not seek male consent or surgery that is not required to remain on hospital records are forced to seek a ' high-risk ' table. Hospital must be presented verbally by an abortion broker. In addition to the operation, it costs around one million won. Kim, a 28-year-old college student who used to work as an abortion broker, says, If you post comments on the Internet about possible abortions, you will receive a deluge of calls. We received 100,000 to 300,000 won per visit in return for randomly calling the gynecologist and making a reservation.○ There is only one case in which 80 abortion sentences in five years of criminal abortion for plant disease were sentenced to jail. The only case is that the suspended woman who underwent an abortion was sentenced to one year in jail in Busan in 2012 for having aborted another woman in her 20s. The other accused received a suspended sentence (51.3 percent) and a suspended sentence (36.3 percent). According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare on July 27, about 170,000 abortions are performed each year. Only about 10 cases are prosecuted each year. That is why abortion is now being quizzed and condemned as a plant crime. Among the 80 accused, 56 (70 percent) were doctors, nurses, and other medical staff. According to the Korea Obstetrics and Gynecology Association, the average daily number of abortions in Korea is currently estimated at 3,000. The judge's worries about reality are revealed when you review the judgment. Three doctors working at a Daejeon gynecologist have been on trial since 2008 on charges of performing abortion on 60, 120 and 140 women each during the three-year period. The court ruled that all of the doctors were suspended. The court ruled that "" Considering the social atmosphere that abortions are virtually acceptable, it was difficult to impose heavy responsibilities on doctors and the pregnant women with abortions had their own convincing circumstances. "" A 29-year-old gynecologist, Maria, 55, says, Women come to hospitals one or two hours away from most of their homes to avoid being seen by strangers. If the women cry and ask for an abortion, it is hard to return it as illegal. If we leave the reality as it is now and don`t correct the abortion laws, we will make women and obstetricians a potential criminal, said Jeong Hyun-mi, a law professor at Ewha Womans University. The abortion laws were designed to break away from the principle of protecting the lives of the unborn children and allow adults to attack each other by their weaknesses, he pointed out.Lee Je-hun, reporter of the newspaper easyhoon@donga.com, Kim Ye-yoon and Choi Ji-sun ; official Facebook ; and hot economic issues ; and total collection of re-teaching methods (click!) ⓒ Donga Ilbo & donga com"

The investigation is considered to be the first of its kind since the Woo Byung-woo division was replaced. Attention is drawn to what results the prosecution will produce under different circumstances. Prosecutors said Monday that Woo will appear at the Seoul Central District Public Prosecutors ' Office Thursday as a suspect. Woo has shown up at the investigating agencies as a suspect three times. Since the prosecution started investigating Woo's wife's real estate prices last year, many lawyers have questioned whether the investigation would proceed. As the Woo Byung-woo division has been all over the prosecution by the control of the prosecution's personnel management, concerns have been aroused over the investigation. Fears were explained by a single photograph. The media caught a controversy over whether to investigate the emperor, who was smiling arm in arm when he appeared at the prosecution's presence last October, was able to catch the verdict. The team disbanded over the incident to an independent counsel without any noticeable results. The investigation into Woo, the former chief of the special prosecution, was also not smooth. At that time, the special prosecutors concentrated on the bribery cases of Samsung and other companies, while the former chief of the Supreme Prosecutors ' Office placed Woo in the background. Meanwhile, prosecutors who sent prosecutors to Iraq are hesitant to investigate the case. The special prosecution then applied to the former chief of staff Lee Seok-soo on suspicion of obstructing the inspection team, but turned over the case to the prosecution when it was dismissed. Although special prosecutor Park Young-soo said, If I had requested a warrant again, I would have been issued, Woo said, but the trial is currently underway without physical detention. The arrest warrant that the prosecutor demanded after investigating about 60 people related to Woo, who received the investigation records, was also rejected. Former Seoul Central District Public Prosecutors ` Office Deputy Director Roh Seung-kwon, who was then a head of the investigation team, was criticized for being designated as Woo Byung-woo Division. Moon Jae-in, however, government, the situation is the prosecution and investigation and changed. Most of the names of those listed as Woo Byung-woo Division`s team were excluded from the investigation headquarters in July. In particular, the entire inspection team of the civil affairs and water analysis office, known as the Woo Byung-woo Special Investigation Unit, was replaced. Prosecutors plan to summon Wu on the morning of July 29 to investigate the suspicion that he received instructions and reports on illegal surveillance. After his trial on July 24, he seems to have made all-out efforts to snatch away the cell phones and vehicles of Woo's returning home. The search was carried out based on the judgment that there was someone inside the prosecution who helped Wu. Since it is unusual for the prosecution to continue its investigations on certain figures for more than a year, the legal circle says it will be the last time for Woo to investigate. Wu is accused of ordering and reporting illegal inspections of former special inspectors. As it is confirmed that the former NIS director Choo Myung-ho, who was arrested for fulfilling the order, is under investigation to deal with the new cases by prosecutors. kafka@newsis.com>"

According to related authorities and businesses on July 28, most Korean tourists who visit Bali during this time are newlyweds and backpacking travelers, with 400-500 daily flights to Korea. Sources familiar with the local situation in Bali said, It usually depends on the days, but since around 400 people per day were canceled during the two days to return home, an estimated 700 to 800 people were stranded. The problem is that it is hard to predict when Bali Eungurarai will resume its operations. Local aviation authorities is an island in the northeast across ash and southwest of the ash from cracks to the island over the same day, when the Ngurah Rai International Airport in the morning.A closed period extended 24 hours to 7 a.m. on August 29.▽ Indonesian Volcanic Circle (Jakarta = Yonhap News Agency) = Hwang Cheol-hwan, Correspondent of Assemblyment Indonesia (BNAC), a volcanic ash on Indonesia's Darwine Island Fire Protection Center (BNPB), released on July 28. If the current wind direction is maintained, it is possible that the airport will not be able to resume operation on July 29. As 445 flights were canceled during the day on July 27 alone, the damage is expected in the event of a prolonged closure of the airport, which left about 59,000 passengers stranded. A Korean Embassy official in Indonesia said, "" We dispatched assistance by the Balinese Association to minimize damage to Koreans. We set up a help desk on the second floor of Eungurae Airport's international airport on July 28.

However, it costs 300,000 roopia (about 24,000 won), and it takes up to 12 hours to get to the main airport, and if the airline does not offer a significant detour bill. Despite such difficulties, tourists who are in an urgent need to return to Korea are using the route, said an official at the Korean embassy. Using neighboring Lombok International Airport is another option. At Bali Eungurarai Airport, buses are offered free of charge to Padang-BallI Port, where you can take a boat to Lombok. Using this, it takes about 4 1/2 hours to get to Lombok. However, the problem is that the operation of Rombok International Airport can be stopped without notice depending on wind direction, etc. Lombok International Airport has been shutting down and resuming operations since it was once closed on the afternoon of July 26.

All the rescued dogs went overseas for adoption to the United States, Britain, and Canada.So far, all dog farms in which HSI has rescued dogs have been voluntarily contacted by owners to confirm closure and readiness of the farms. Kim Na-ra, campaign manager at HSI, said, "" There has been a growing number of inquiries and requests from dog farmers lately.

High room rates and no reservation fee, 10 % of all room reservations, and the community's only staying room rate. The photo shows a rental banner hanging on the street of Hoenggye-ri, Daegwanryeong-myeon, Pyeongchang-gun. Yonhap news sports fan Cho Joon-hyeok (42, Yongin City) recently planned to attend the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics on February 9. Because of the high rate of accommodation, which costs 400,000 won per night. I planned to visit Gangneung with my family, but I found out that when I checked the price, I had to cancel my hotel or pension plan for the hotel with good facilities by more than 400,000 won per night.At least things are looking up in Gangneung. "" Last chance! Reservation!Burst reservation! Only one room remaining! "" If you search Daegwanryeong-myeon's accommodation, the main stadium for the Pyeongchang Games, is located on February 10 next year, you will see only two cases. Among them, the hotel-level G Resort, with a maximum of six people for three rooms, costs 1.7 million won per night under the terms of the contract. If you search for accommodation in Pyeongchang during the Olympics, you will find the most accommodation in Bongpyeong-myeon, 40 kilometers away. A similar pension is priced at 600,000 won per night. The Pyeongchang Olympics, which is nearly two months away, is hardly attracting public attention. Unlike the summer Olympics, the pandom-prone winter Olympics are essential for Korean fans, but the skyrocketing fees are pointed out as the biggest reason to turn away tourists. According to the organizing committee of Gangwon Province and Pyeongchang on July 27, about 30,000 rooms are needed per day during the Pyeongchang Games. So far, about 73,000 rooms have been booked, including 22,254 hotels, condominium and 57,700 guest rooms. They have more than twice the amount of rooms they need, but the problem is the price. As prices have increased since the beginning of this year to target special Olympics, it is not easy for tourists to find accommodations at a price that is convincing. Prices of ice skating events, ice hockey and figure skating, in Gangneung, where popular events are to be held, have risen sharply since early this year. A pension fee in Gangneung, which was around 150,000 won per night during the summer vacation, has recently jumped to 420,000 won. Some hotels in Gangneung saw their expenses soar to 400,000 won in time for the opening of the Games. It was about 50,000 won more expensive than a five-star hotel in Seoul. Room and pension facilities that can accommodate group tourists cost close to one million won per day. That is why some say the price is too high, even considering the special Olympics.Motels in downtown Gangneung, which once soared to 600,000 won per night, are still not understandable to tourists, although the cost of motels has decreased by an average of 260,000 won recently. From the beginning of this year, it is rare to find a place where people can get reservations of less than 200,000 won per day during the Olympics, said one owner, the same story goes for Gangneung or Pyeongchang.However, it is not easy to book accommodation. Some businesses are reluctant to make individual reservations because they need to attract group tourists. Due to the controversy over the excessive price and refusal to book tickets by individual customers, the booking rate for the Olympics periods at accommodations in Gangneung and Pyeongchang is currently just over 10 percent. High rates are also having a negative influence on the sales of Olympic Games tickets.While businesses that are seeking special Olympics events are hesitant to avoid games, many say, "" If you miss the timing, you could face a disaster. "" In particular, if the Seoul-Gangnung KTX line starts to run next month, tourists will be able to travel to metropolitan areas in large numbers, causing concern over even large-scale "" public affairs. "" As the situation got worse, the host region and residents expressed concern.The central branch of the Korea Federation of Bedroom Industry and the Association of Rural Homestead Homestead Association announced yesterday that the entire city of Gangneung is being asked to provide more affordable accommodation, as it requested to refuse short-term and individual hotel reservations. They also called for the eradication of the overcharging, saying, When the 2012 Yeosu Expo was held, the rate of the rooms rose to 200,000 to 300,000 won per night, making it problematic to pay exorbitant prices after it opened. As it is possible to avoid paying through the nose, we need to take special measures to undermine the national image of the Republic of Korea as well as the Korean economy.Gangneung : Park Eun-seong, Correspondent.com, Choi Heung-soo, ▶ Korea Daily [Facebook], [Kakao Friends] ▶ Sign up for the Naver channel![ⓒ Do not illegally transfer or redistribute by Hankook Ilbo (hankookilbo.com),]"

Trump in Thanksgiving Day message, "" our citizens as a member of the family proud to be an American is president (citizen) new ties of loyalty, love and trust each other the field.Let's go with it, "" said emphatically. Stephen Vannan, the former senior White House strategist, would say outright, "" America is a country of citizenship.

Barack Obama's former administration has a policy of helping young immigrants, both parents and the American people, go to the U.S. as part of their campaign to get rid of what they call detrees.

Until then, no laws existed that would regulate the migration to the United States. Then, how long has it been since the U.S. immigrated to the country? The U.S. cable network History said it began declaring independence in the late 1700s. Prior to that, black Americans and European settlers entered the United States regardless of their will to do so were the main culprits. The meaning of immigrants and settlers is entirely different. Immigration is the people who have to abide by the laws of the country they migrate from, and settlers are here to defy the current system and make their own laws. The United States locked its doors to immigrants more than 100 years ago. Starting with the Chinese exclusion law in 1882, it slowly and cruelly closed the Immigration Act, which passed the Asian Prohibition Act in 1917 and limited immigrants to less than 2 percent of the population in 1924. And now, 100 years later, we are witnessing again the same scene. As the abolition of the DACA was announced, the story of immigration law, which stirred controversy when it was created in 1924, is being discussed again. `` The 1924 immigration law remained an indelible stain on our history, '' said May Tsourambiah, a professor of Asian and American Studies at Columbia University, explaining the problem of racism in their view of the world's based apartheid. ◇ immigrants towards 2015 after more close, the United States isolation is 'deepening' the former president celebrated Thanksgiving, Obama has the following message.

' That's us the greatest country on earth makes the background of the element. "" Trump the president of the ongoing anti-immigrant policies ' to put America back.A grand ambition to make great ' is hiding. But a bolt up against immigrants does not guarantee a solution to U.S. economic problems or better security. We can not guarantee that the United States will have more influence on the international arena. Rather, it can only deepen the U.S. isolation. "" The closing of U.S. immigration is based on the same false accusations as 100 years ago. We don`t think isolating ourselves would solve the problem, explained the statement. It is not to say that the United States should unconditionally open its borders to immigrants. Because whatever is extreme is not good. However, the general consensus is that genuine solutions to the immigration problem should be made with sufficient time to gather the opinions of all interested parties and discuss them thoroughly.Jenny Minier, a sociology professor at the University of Kentucky, wrote in an article to the local media, "" National security and employment rates are important issues, and although they are correct, they can not effectively limit immigration by a wide margin. Before reforming the immigration law, we must acknowledge the fact that there are many immigrants who improve the U.S. economy in their own ways. !

"On July 23, Chung Seung-yo, a math teacher, teaches math with his partner in the classroom of Anam Elementary School Class II in Seoul. When the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education's "" Cooperative Education and the Education System "" teaches students a lot of subjects such as mathematics, the level of difficulty and difficulty of each group adjusted as they studied together is very important. As the number of students who gave up math skills increased as a third grader, I could barely make it as I was getting on track. It was sad to know that the difference between the students was huge, but I could not keep an eye on each other to tell them. Meanwhile, he learned that he is operating a cooperative education system with the Gangbuk Innovation Education District project. I hesitated to see anyone watching my class all the time, but thinking about the children would make two people better than one teacher. At first, he saw the role of a collaborative teacher as a concept that would not directly teach the class content, but only help students when they need materials or preparation for an activity. However, a cooperative teacher who came to the actual school majored in mathematics and was able to teach for a long time due to her long teaching experience. I expected positive effects to be gained by taking the class together. Kim said, "" As I understand contents by student level, I usually take all kinds of classes. In the beginning, he made a group of children by mixing the good and the bad. The cooperator went around the classroom, guiding students to fail to catch up. In the second semester, he created two groups of students who lack basic skills. The cooperator taught the children the difficult parts one-on-one, starting with basic concepts. When dealing with relatively easy content, when it was difficult to deal with it all together, the teachers explained the concepts to the students in a lower group again and asked them to answer the less difficult questions. The materials were prepared together after prior consultation between the two teachers. Kim said, Students who fall behind in performance first give counseling because it can hurt themselves, and then include the students who want to be left out in the group. As they work out the problem by step, their achievements have increased and satisfaction has improved their overall attitude in class. As part of the Seoul Innovation Education District project, more than 100 schools in 22 districts are currently operating the ' Teaching Methods and Cooperation Education System, ' like Miyang.On July 23, Chung Seung-yo, a math teacher, teaches math with a cooperative teacher in the classroom of Anam Elementary School II in Seoul. Give assistance to underperforming students learning classes to keep up with Moon Jae-in during the 2002 presidential election campaign pledge of the president, who was also large achievement gap like a math curriculum is ‘1 2 gyosaje’.Dispatched an assistant for learning is sluggish during the keynote to student guidance. The "" primary cooperative education system "" (the cooperative education system below), modeled after the pledge, has been operated by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education since 2015. It is similar to the two-shift system of teaching to provide individualized support to slow-learned students and maladjusted students. For first and second graders, Korean and math classes are allowed to be held within 14 hours per week. 52 public schools are now in the process of introducing a cooperative education system. Most teachers at Anam Elementary School in Seoul, who run a cooperative school system, said, Most teachers don`t want anyone to enter and watch the classroom. I felt like I was watching the class at first, so I felt pressured by my teachers. Jeong calls her partner a "" helpteacher. "" Teachers miss out on what they usually do or take care of all the students. When this happens, the teacher is encouraged to go to the back and quietly tell her what she is lacking. When they are active in the middle of class, two teachers move around to help. Students have improved their academic performance since the class was held with a collaborative teacher. Cooperator teachers attend a class year meeting and make teaching materials with other teachers. Students who took collaborative lessons were generally satisfied by the simple and kind explanation of their "" when the class contents do not make sense or the problem is left unanswered. "" It was difficult to memorize multiplication tables and graphs in order, but my help teacher told me, Since there are two teachers, more students can get help during class. Park Keun-ah said, "" Help teachers helped make bookmarks or ' Maracas ' instruments during class. It is good to have a board game or Lego block with you during your break. It is important how to share roles with fellow teachers in the first place, Jeong said. The lessons are basically conducted by teachers, but it is good enough if you are able to coordinate how much help you can get involved. Poor study does not come at once but builds up gradually. Rather than getting rid of sluggish performance, it is more important to encourage students not to catch up in class. Help teachers fill in small difficulties in class by the time it takes. "" Cooperative teachers and students use rock paper to mark the numbers in class. The two schools ' cases are when their teachers actively participate in class. However, it is difficult to provide a clear role for teachers of cooperation since their abilities are vastly different at the moment. Because the selection criteria vary from school to school. Although elementary schools prepare for activities or take care of children, it is important to teach them subject matter in secondary schools. The current standard is vague, like, "" If you are over 20, you can apply. "" It was good for my partner to share experiences and share thoughts not just doing simple work but also making lessons together. It would be good to pick someone with the ability to participate in the class and give them the proper treatment. "" The number of classes per week is also set at around 14 hours. Therefore, some schools benefit only from a certain class when they attend morning classes, and others can not be implemented throughout the school year. Even that helps prepare for classes or make materials as an aid instructor, and also helps persuade children who can not concentrate in class on a short time. Jung-3 is very fast and there are many leading children, making it difficult for every student to fully understand the class. He taught me from the basics as a group of students who lack in learning. The children who scored between 30 and 40 were surprised and delighted to see themselves score 60 or 70. "" I feel less burdened when I have to take classes and my children are more comfortable with me. Instead, they work all morning long, but when they have only one, two, or four classes, they are paid by the hour. A tutor who works only in the morning can not see half of the class that is scheduled for the afternoon because they go in less than half. The teachers should be better treated so that their children can have equal benefits. "" Some suggest a two-shift teaching system as an alternative to the one-class quota rules. However, the teachers raised questions or showed cautious opinions. One teacher said, I should wait and see, but it is fundamentally meaningless to add more jobs unless we hire regular teachers. To fully utilize the intent of the second class teaching system, we need to improve the standards and the treatment of teachers who choose our partners.

"[Seoul Newspaper Now News] "" We were born from eggs. "" One to two hundred million sperm must swim for eggs and compete. In the process, weak sperm is killed by vaginal acidic materials and macrophages, and only strong sperm continues its journey. The first sperm will overcome the obstacle of egg ball cells, but as energy is exhausted, the sperm will die. Then, it is our belief to date that the next best sperm will combine with the eggs to form fertilized eggs.However, studies have shown that during the fertilization process, eggs can choose the superior individual among sperm that arrived at them. In other words, eggs are not as passive as they used to be.Researchers at the Pacific Northwest National Research Center in the United States say the new study enables women's eggs to choose sperm with the best chance of becoming healthy.On the other hand, Jeong-su did not seem to have the ability to filter out such bad genes, the researchers say.The study denies Mendelian rule that the combination of reproductive cells in fertilization takes an opportunity to be equal. For a long time scientists have reflected traditional gender roles in their studies, manually reflecting them into their own studies, and thereby highlighting them as sperm.Dr. Joseph Neido, who led the study, explained how eggs became active participants in reproduction rather than traditional theories.He found in the study that the fertilization process was not random and that the obvious mating relationship between an egg and a sperm was more common than it was when it was not.Dr. Naido said female mice with cloned mutations, normal genes and all of the genes that did not remove the genetic mutations that would increase the risk of testicular cancer as part of his research, and female mice and scientists who did not.As a result, their offspring randomly inherited mutations genes, according to Mendel's laws.However, when a second experiment showed that all genes were created with normal female mice and male mice with cancerous mutations, only 27 percent of the offspring had mutations. This is significantly less than what 75 percent of the offspring would expect to see mutations, suggesting eggs chose sperm with good genes.William Everhart, a behaviorist at the Smithsonian Institute of Tropical Research, said scientists call it the "" selection of hidden females. ""There is no clear evidence of how this happens in the course of the amendment, but Dr. Neido suggests two possibilities.The first possibility is that the metabolic rates of the B vitamin complex, such as folic acid, which is an important signal molecule, depend on sperm and eggs. These differences may affect how sperm and eggs attract each other.Another possibility is that the sperm entered the fertilized site of the magneto-generation crown before the egg was completely formed. Because the presence of sperm affects the formation of the egg, the gene can be as suitable as possible for the sperm.The results of the study were published in a recent issue of the Journal of the American Genomics Society (GSA).Photo = Mansum 00 8otorlia th20022@seoul.co.krThe crime scene investigation team announced on July 28 that it confirmed that Lee Young-sook was the DNA analysis of a bone found in the guest room area of the National Institute of Scientific Investigation.Lee is one of three people whose bodies have already been cleared of debris since the sinking of the Sewol vessel. Lee was fully dressed from head to feet on May 22 in a 3-story stern portside cabin with a jacket and a life jacket. Lee`s funeral was held on July 13 in Busan.Meanwhile, the crime scene investigation office in Sewol did not notify the relatives of five would-be funeral processions who had buried the remains on July 17, raising suspicion of concealment.The ministry, which conducted its first survey on the site, announced its findings on July 23, saying, We believe the remains of the team were not already collected. In response, the family of five who had not tried to do with the disease ended their funeral without knowing that their remains were found.Minister Kim Young-choon said in a statement at the time when he announced the results of an investigation, "" I think I have found three bodies in the passenger compartment after salvage, and none of them were found to have been eliminated by any other bodies. ""< New reporter Yoon Hee-il yhi@kyunghyang.com> The 13th-time exhibition this year brings together about 670 game providers from 35 countries to showcase various new games, including mobile, online and VR games. The event will continue until the 19th of this year. The gaming industry is becoming the new center of the Korean wave. As three Korean game makers are expected to break the 2 trillion won mark in annual sales, it is likely that they will become major Korean wave contents. It is no stranger to game venture capitalists becoming stars and billionaires in the morning. It is quite unusual for foreigners who are crazy about hallyu games to be treated as heroes at global events. However, would it be exaggerated to have another shadow growing behind this stage of commercial enthusiasm? It is a growing controversy over gambling. Advertisements who are addicted to gambling use their parents ' credit cards to scratch out 15 million won, and high school girls who are busy studying for college entrance exams are reported to spend 40 million won on stochastic items. Although this is an extreme case, it is undeniable that not a few homes are in turmoil over gambling. Most game makers earn their profits by encouraging the games played by children with self-control, with an extremely low probability of winning Lotto. They are using every trick in the book to avoid the grades of teenage users. Raising the question, it begins with the question of whether we should restrain the booming game industry again with regulations. Of course, regulation is not everything. Nor is the argument for "" thorough unilateralism "" with a solemn principle of moralism in order to avoid game addiction in children the right approach. However, one should also be cautious of the golden supremacism, which is, "" If you make good money, you can forgive it. "" Neither of the extremes is desirable for the sustainable growth of the nation's game market. After all, it is time for the game industry to seek a new profit model, not just a pretense of self-regulation. Otherwise, it would be hard to say anything if the government tried to re-inhibition the regulations from outside. It is already promising. The National Assembly is paying attention to the harmful effects of the games and discussing regulations.

In case of me, I was in the middle of a speech course, but I first heard it because of the introduction of the speaker. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : At first, when you invest in the company, you got a good return and increased your investment. Of course, when you first made a profit, you would be proud of yourself. So family and friends bought the machine and now there are people who think about their relationship with their family and friends is very bad, feeling depressed, and even committing suicide. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > How much did you get when you first bought one, each month? ♫ Binhyeon : When I first did, it was actually an abnormal return. So, it was true that if you invest about 3 million won, it would cost 300,000 won per month, or possibly 1 million won per month, when it was small. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > No, three million won invested, and it costs one million won per month, as a profit? ♫ Vinhyeonu : That's why the price of virtual currency was so bad. So, a lot of people have invested heavily in mining equipment. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I bet. I bought one for three million won, and seeing that it costs me a million won every month, I wonder how much more it would have cost me. I guess you must have gotten a little bit involved with that rumor. So, some people have invested 100 million won in wedding funds since the beginning of the year. Some of you have invested 100 million won to start a chicken house, and now others say that you and I have raised enough money to build an apartment together, so we have a very good friend and we have a same apartment complex. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Ouch! But when did you first get the money and then start feeling strange? Mr Vinhyeon : In fact, many people doubted and started from the beginning. Because from the beginning, when I saw it on the Internet, I heard that there was a scam on the Internet, but when I saw it on the Internet, I took a lot of pictures in front of the mining equipment in IDC Center. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : A photo full of really high performance computers, a real life photo. Now that I have a photo of it from someone who introduced it or taken it myself, I finally got the credit. So first the doubt disappears. And the actual mining gets larger as it comes into virtual money. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > But now, I don't know what a virtual currency is and I don't know if you just got a chance to make money. D.A. Vinhyeonu > Yes. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > How did the expert get fooled? Mr Vinhyeon : Experts are also cheated. But I'm actually the head of the mining Max victims ' group that they voted for. Actually, many people, not just me, would have doubted it at first. As I told you earlier, I saw evidence such as photos and actually invested a lot in the virtual currency. In fact, from around May, the virtual currency itself has really soared. Now that it's more than 10 times higher, I don't think Mining Max founded the company to cheat from scratch. But suddenly the virtual currency was going through the roof, and the demand for the mining equipment was really strong, because the purchasing demand was so high. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : Are you saying that you can not buy the mining equipment when the demands for investment are growing? D.A. Vinhyeon : greed will be mine, mining Max. Because money is always coming in. But since I was greedy but had no money to pay for the mining equipment, I couldn't afford to pay for the mining equipment and the parts were out of stock. That's when it appears that the mining machine began a little bit of a expediency, taking the money it took to buy a virtual currency. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > that is, the parts procurement is also slow. So, if you can't afford to buy the machines and turn them, you should stop recruiting investors there, but you didn't stop, did you? That's where the problem started. Mr Vinhyeon : Yes. Now Chairman Mining Max is on the run to the United States and the miners are not recovering. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Mining Guild Then How many machines did you have? ♫ Binhyeon Woo > I did not know how many actually happened, but there is a company on the face. When I visited the mining company and told them about the mining industry, they found that there are over 20,000 machines. ◇ Have you ever had Kim Hyeon-jung, 20,000 or so? There are more than twenty thousand Vinhyeonu and you will purchase the parts for money to install the machine? The top company confirmed that there are about 50,000 of them when all the components are together. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > If you are an investor like this, how much time should you have spent on mining equipment? ⑨ Vinhyeonu > estimated between 60,000 and 70,000, but since there are approximately 50,000, it appears that it will rain 10,000 or 20,000. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > has become increasingly vulnerable. The problem is, I heard that it's multI-step recruitment. If you bring in one, you raise your grade, in this way. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Singer Park Jeong-woon : How were you involved? Mr Vinhyeon : I was quite unaware. The fact that I had a network connection with Park Jung-woon was totally unknown to Korean victims and I knew it from an article. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Really? Didn't you see Park Jung-woon say he went to these events and promoted the program? Vinhyeon I asked, but no one saw anything. In fact, the article says that Ino E & C, played by Park Jung-woon, is another subsidiary of Chairman of Mining Max Park, and then, most of whom have invested in Ino A&C by investing in Ino. Park Jung-un is familiar with Park since he was in the United States with the president. Then the chairman took 8 billion won. I wonder if I have washed my money. So when the prosecution searched and searched him and grounded him, we actually learned all this from an article. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > The head of the victims ' group must have shown a lot of confidence when they saw the article. ⑨ Vinhyeonu > Very personally, I guess Park Jung-woon is also a victim so carefully. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Park Jeong-woon must have been fooled in the process. So it's a cautious prediction that you're watching the incident, and you suspect it might have turned out to be deception. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Okay. Among the listeners here, isn't this a ' high risk high return '? There's a lot of talk about investing, you know, because you know, the bottom line is that all these high returns come with incredible investment risks, in fact, the responsibility of the individual. It's not like we're not responsible for anything we invest. But we have a mining machine. I went to the top store to ask why they didn't return the mining equipment when there was a mining equipment, and the factory manager said, "" Don't return it until the investigation is over. "" And then I went to Max."
"yo In fact, Max Factory is one hundred percent owned by Mining Max. But he's not returning the drill. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > ` We should deal with this incident carefully in order to prevent such a scam, since many working class members did not know what virtual currency was really about and jumped in. ` Let's hear it this way. Thank you. Virtual money is representative of the group of victims in the scam. It was Bin Hyun-woo. There is no disruption. Photo = Yonhap News Agency [Lee Dal-lee, Park Chul-keun, Kwon Oh-seok], "" I don't know anyone who hasn't tried Line No. 9 during rush hour. There is a reason why it is called Jiokcheol. I'm already worried about commuting because I think it could cause disruptions. I think we should look for another way to get to work. '' Chang Kyung-jin (42), who lives in Deungchon-dong, Gangseo-gu, Seoul, sighed as soon as she heard the news of the strike on subway line 9. Jang's workplace is near Kyobo Tower intersection, where Shinnonhyeon Station on Line No. 9 is located. The news that unions will go on strike despite the current war on commuting has already led to worries. The labor union of Seoul, which is in charge of operating the first stage of Subway Line No. 9 (Gaehwa and Shinnonhyeon stations), held a press conference at the KCTU office on July 27 and went on strike for six days. It is the first strike in eight years since the company was established in 2009. The union argued that it needed to hire more people to operate, maintain and maintain subways to protect the safety and lives of citizens.◇ At least 45 more workers must be added ... As labor intensity is lower than subway lines 1 to 8, unions complain of excessive labor intensity due to the fact that the number of workers on subway lines 1 to 8 is significantly lower. "" Subway lines one to eight carry around 160,000 people per employee, whereas subway lines nine to three to 260,000, "" an official of the union said. "" The average subway driver who drives alone works on subway lines one to three days. "" Among the 25 stations, 15 are working as one full-time. To resolve the current situation, we need to hire at least 45 to 60 more workers, he said. Labor unions, in particular, accused the company of trying to fill in the pockets of foreign investors rather than reinvestment revenues for passenger and employee safety.While the Seoul Transportation Corp., which operates subway lines 1 through 8, loses hundreds of billions of won per year, Seoul Subway Line 9 maintains a surplus. The audit report showed that the operation of the Seoul Line 9 line last year generated 67.5 billion won in revenue, 3.6 billion won in operating profit and 2.7 billion won in net income.French joint-contractor Trance Deb Korea, which has invested in operating the Seoul Line No. 9 for seven years since it was established in 2009, received a cumulative dividend of 23.48 billion, according to the union. The French head of the union said that they would not budge the dividend they were taking, adding, We will discuss the second strike if we don`t agree on the first strike. (Data : Audit report on Subway Line No. 9, Unit : KRW 100. ◇) ◇struction…the subway line in Seoul is more dangerous to run than "" Hell "" but it is notorious for its location. This is because they are composed of 4 cars and less than half of the other lines (8 to 10 cars). The number of train passengers is only 650 per train configuration, which is significantly lower than subway lines 1 to 8 (maximum 1,300 to 1,600). However, the rush hour is the highest on all subway lines in Seoul, as many companies commute to and from Gangnam. In particular, the congestion rate of Yeomchang Station on Subway Line No. 9 is 233 percent. This means that it takes 2.3 times more passengers than 160 people to get on a train. Against this backdrop, many are concerned that the situation could worsen if the strike results in a disruption. The union decided to operate normally during the strike as usual during rush hour (7 a.m. to 9 a.m.) to minimize inconvenience to residents. However, the company will maintain the current operating rate at 85 percent during the rush hour and at 50 percent during the rest of the day.The daily number of operations on subway lines 9 through 9 in Seoul is 502 times, including 256 normal times and 246 times an express. We have prepared contingency transportation measures to prepare for the strike, company officials said, planning to consult with the union through dialogue. Even when we go on strike, I don`t think it would be inconvenient for citizens to get ready to operate normally not only during rush hour but also during the rest of the day.The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, the nation`s No. 9 labor union, holds a news conference Thursday morning to start a strike on November 30 at the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions in central Seoul. (Photo : Yonhap news agency), "" If we were to delay the strike, we were concerned about delays in driving, "" said Kim Hee-gwang, 29, adding, "" If we want to go to work on the subway line, we should send workers to work one more time. The union said it would not interfere with its operations during the regular hours, but it is doubtful whether it would be possible for the negotiation to be completed as soon as more work is done by one person.The union said the train was delayed by about 30 minutes after conducting a protest against the rule of law, which prevents excessive driving from taking place on busy areas.Another office worker, Aunt (27), said, I think it is their right to strike. I hope that the inconvenience for office workers going to and from subway lines number nine will be resolved soon as subway lines were originally complicated.Since the operator of subway line No. 9 is a private operator, the Seoul Metropolitan Government first says it will observe the situation of agreement between labor and management and the situation of operations following strikes.We plan to operate 100 percent of the time even if the operation of the subway lines in Seoul goes on strike, said a city official.Park Cheol-geun (konpol@edaily.co.kr) < EDALI - forbidden from illegally copying and distributing the books > "" Woo Byeong-woo, can this be opened to me?

When former chief of the NIS was inspecting Lee last year, he told Choo Myung-ho, then director of the NIS, to investigate the movements of the former commissioner of the NIS, and was told to investigate into illegal inspections. In the same way, Lee Kwang-koo, former president of Woori Bank, and Kim Jin-sun, former head of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics organizing committee, were illegally inspected.

Although it is widely used on Korean websites, it has been pointed out that it has side effects such as malicious code infections, conflicts between programs, and PC reboots, and that it is not working properly in other browsers or mobile phones. In many cases, the entire procedure was neutralized by the "" active X "" error before the final payment for online shopping. In particular, foreigners who work for the government have become very uncomfortable.

In addition, the government will establish a plan to improve the mandatory use of public certificates within December and accelerate the abolition of the public certification procedures. The ministry will also organize disaster safety and enhance privacy by establishing disaster safety networks, leaking personal information and preventing misuse. Kim Dong-pyo, reporter of the Korea Post, letmein@asiae.co.kr The Education Ministry and the Korean Council for University President announced at the third meeting of the Association for the Improvement of University, Student and Government Admissions on July 24 that 156 private universities have adopted entrance ceremonies, orientation of freshmen, and other student support programs as an adjustment program. Under an agreement signed by the university, student and government negotiators, private universities will phase out their admission fees in four to five years after passing the tuition review committee. The period of tuition abolition is four years for universities with an average admission fee of less than 773,000 won and five years for universities with an average admission fee of 773,000 won. 95 schools with an average admission fee of 773,000 won will reduce the cost of tuition by 20 percent every year from next year to 2021. At 61 four-year universities with an average admission fee of 773,000 won or more, the remaining 80 percent of the total cost of tuition will be cut by 16 percent every year from next year to 2022. The ministry provides tuition by 2021 when the reduction is to be completed (4 year reduction target) and 2022 (5 year reduction target). However, after that, 20 % of the entrance fee is to be applied with state scholarships and in 2022. As a result, freshmen in 2021 and 2022 are required to pay the admission fees of 0 won. After three to four years, the tuition at private universities is actually abolished. According to the Education Ministry, students and their parents will be able to reduce their tuition fees from 914.4 billion won in 2018, 134.2 billion won in 1915, 176.9 billion won in 2020, and 219.7 billion won in 2021, based on private universities The Education Ministry will expand financial support for private universities, taking into consideration the financial decline of private universities due to the phase-out of tuition. The general financial support system is adopted that enables universities to freely use the government budget for general operating expenses (labor, administrative expenses, and even administrative expenses). The university's basic competency assessment (Assessment of university restructuring) shows that when assessed as the top 60 % of all universities ' institutions ' best results, the university supported universities without any further assessment, and extended its support budget by 60 % or more. The university, student, and education ministry also agreed to work together to enact a grant of higher education law to secure stable funds for higher education.Universities claim that it is difficult to have stable budgets because of various variables when budgets are organized every year. The ministry said, "" National universities will scrap their tuition (from 2018) and private universities will join in abolishing tuition, reducing the burden on students and their parents ' tuition levels to an aggressive, multI-disciplinary level.

"All nine hospitals nationwide are expected to provide doctors with special facilities for the medical care. Of course, I had to rest for the rest of the five days, so I could not even dream of visiting my home or home during the holidays. As a trauma surgeon, he sighed, "" The hardest thing to do is not seeing a patient but being able to stay with your family. "" Calls for improvement in the harsh reality of the local trauma center are growing on the plea of a professor at Jou University Hospital in Aju University, Lee Guk-jong, who survived the bullet wound. The workers in the hospital are all the more responsible for the deficit despite suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome. The government announced that it would revamp the health insurance pay system and expand manpower support, and the National Assembly is taking active steps to increase the national budget regardless of what it calls the "" Lee Gook-jung. "" However, doctors and academics agree that helping the credit center, which serves as a social safety net, is not enough. He said, "" When we received public attention, we increased the budget and came up with measures, but when the interest was decreased, we were left alone again. "" An official at the University of Aju Hospital said, We are afraid that the attention will fade as we did during the operation for the name of the Gulf Coast Guard in 2011. The Health and Welfare Ministry said on July 27, "" The government can provide up to 120 million won per year in support for doctors ' work to boost the local trauma center, which currently operates. It consists of 20 specialists in four subjects : surgery, chest surgery, neurosurgery and orthopedics, and three professors of emergency medicine, imaging and anesthesia. Though the maximum number of employees who can apply is considered the minimum number of employees who can operate the trauma center, considering the shift work, attendance at various academic conferences, and vacations. However, none of the nine trauma centers in operation is filled with 23. There are 18 doctors at Gacheon-dae Hospital, Mokpo Korean Hospital, and Busan University Hospital, respectively, and only 15 doctors at Aju University Hospital and Wonju Christian Hospital. The number of hospitals is about 10. An official at Uijeongbu St. Mary's Hospital, which is preparing to open in the first half of next year, said, The biggest obstacle to the opening is the recruitment of specialists, adding, So far, we have only eight doctors. The lack of sufficient manpower in trauma centers is mainly due to the avoidance of so-called unpopular departments, which can not open later, such as general surgery and chest surgery. In this year's recruitment, general surgeons found only 172 percent of the 191 people in the garden were volunteers, compared with 90.1 percent of the 46 who received the breast cancer, and 54.3 percent of the total stayed at the hospital. Even surgeons and chest surgeons most avoid trauma centers. He knows better than anything else, that he has to work on unusual schedules every year to work around the clock with fewer people. Professor Lee Gook-jong of Korea University is known to have suffered from bad eyesight, with his left eye almost blind, after a long absence. It is a vicious cycle that leads to "" avoiding work, "" "" not working. "" Compared to such efforts, the government support wage of 120 million won is not enough. Although the government is currently discussing increasing the per capita support amount, the medical community says a few more dollars is not enough to solve the problem right away. Of course, the improvement should be made, but it is still so intense that it would not be easy to eliminate the younger doctors ` reluctance to avoid it, Chang Sung-wook said, adding, The trauma specialist is socially recognized. The one-time Center support fee can support the staff cost of the center. However, nurses who are important do not have any government support and are reluctant to get their staff from hospitals. The cost of nurse staff is now covered by a number of hospitals, that is, the cost of treating trauma patients. Even with a nurse in charge, the staff is busy arranging them so that the nurses can suffer from severe workload. The hospital has 14 nurses who are in charge of the hospital, and they work two shifts every 12 hours. Jeon Eun-hye, a trauma nurse at Azu University Hospital said, "" Because trauma patients need to have multiple patients due to fractures, brain, and rupture of organs, they need to have easy access to surgery rooms, emergency rooms, and intensive care centers. "" As a result, there are many places where nurses who work in intensive care units or ward, rather than having their own nurses operated on. Some point out that the government support for the trauma center is one-time, excluding medical personnel expenses. Government aid is the only aid worth 8 billion won to hospitals in selecting trauma centers, excluding medical personnel expenses. Local governments may provide support, but this is also a one-time payment. Cho Hyun-min, director of the Regional trauma center at Busan National University Hospital, said, "" Although 8 billion won in government aid was a sweet temptation to attract the center, there is no money left over when facilities and equipment were available. "" Trauma center running 24 hours the deterioration of the device easy replacement and repair costs on government support is not that there are difficulties. ▽ Franke-Engaged Structure = Unless the current deficit structure is resolved, support for trauma centers, which are estimated to cost 40 billion won a year, will inevitably become a drain on the bottom line. We need to turn the trauma center into a surplus structure so that hospitals can increase their own facilities and investment in personnel, said Kim Yoon, a professor of the medical science department at Seoul National University. The reason why the center can not make a surplus is due to the strict screening by the Suga System and Shim Pyeong-won, which do not reflect the uniqueness of the trauma center, which is subject to intensive care. For example, when calculating the cost of surgery at the trauma center, a fee of 100 % is paid for the main part of the surgical procedure, and for the rest of the surgical area, 70 % are paid for the general unit (senior hospital). Surgery at once reduces the cost of personnel, materials, etc. input, which is largely due to the deficit in trauma centers, where most people with whole-body injury occur. If MRI or CT shows no problems, the practice of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) to reduce the price of a picture is also pointed out as a problem. The system was set up for fear of overshot in general hospitals, but it is not appropriate for critical trauma centers to determine where they were injured by using MRI or CT. If patients are eligible for health insurance, they can claim the entire amount of the non-pay insurance, but they can not claim the non-pay insurance policy from an insurance company or patient, which is controlled by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. That means they should not pay for AIDS medication like a simple test, but should do so with hospital money. Professor Kim Yoon said, We need improvements such as a 10 percent increase in undervalued prices. Most of all, there is a loud call for improvement in perception. "" Even in the medical world, it is said that ' we need to deal with serious trauma patients in the emergency room. ' "" Cho Hyun-min, director of the center, said, "" We need to prepare for the treatment of patients by having an inadequate 24 hours.

It is issued in the name of the Mayor, the Gun Magistrate or the District Governor in accordance with the Youth Welfare Support Act. The certificate can be used as an identity card in the College Scholastic Ability Test, the certification examination, and financial transactions. The fees for the use of public transportation, culture, and leisure facilities operated by the government or local governments may be exempted or discounted. In addition, although resident registration numbers are not included in the student ID card, the accuracy of identification will be increased since the registration numbers are stated on the student ID card.The system was put into effect by the Culture and Tourism Ministry in 2003 according to the recommendation of the National Human Rights Commission and was expanded nationwide in 2004. The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family has taken over the business since 2010, marking its 14th year in the nation.The number of teenage cards issued in 2014 is increasing to 50,000, 94,000 cases in 2015, and 110,000 last year.

From 2010 to last year, the number of teenage children's certificates was 420,000, accounting for only 8.1 percent of the total number of teenagers who received their certificates.In addition, teens do not feel the need for teen ID cards very much because they are issued a student ID card by school. Adolescents without "" student ID "" were more likely to avoid getting a juvenile card as they were not likely to be recognized as delinquents.The fact that teenagers have different age standards causes confusion. The Act provided that the youth age is defined as ‘ 9-24 ’, and under the Act on the Protection of Children under 19 ’. Lee (20), who visited a public art museum in anticipation of a youth discount and paid an adult-based admission fee, said, "" I thought I was legal until I was 24, but I failed to get a discount. ""In many areas of the facility, teenage disease is apparently neglected. Recently, one large movie theater offered only ' student ID or uniform ' as a condition for its guide of ' youth ticket prices. ' He excluded the official identification card, teenage ID card. As if we had belatedly identified the existence of the disease, we explained, Of course, it is possible to get teen ID cards, and then added, It was just a suggestion of a relatively better known student ID card and uniform.As a result, some argue that students should absorb and integrate their ID cards into their teenage ID cards and distribute them to teenagers in a mass manner. As we strive to promote and expand our teenage cards, an official at the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family said, we are seeing an increase in the number of schools applying as a group to add transportation card features to their cards starting this year.Lee Ha-young, reporter of Incheon Newspaper hiyoung@seoul.co.kr The ministry said it requested a DNA analysis from the National Institute of Scientific Investigation on Tuesday that the remains were identified as remains of Yi Young-sook by the head of the bureau.

The Chungnam Provincial Police Agency announced on July 28 that it arrested a mother (36, Yeongi) on suspicion of abandoning a nine-month-old baby boy (violating the Special Law on Child Abuse). A is accused of dumping a nine-month-old baby in a ginseng field in Hongseong-gun, South Chungcheong Province around 7 a.m. on July 27. Police confirmed that the woman who went to her brother's house after the baby was abandoned, confessed to her brother, "" I abandoned the baby. "" His brother reported it to the police, and the police found the body of an infant in one of the three human fields. Until now, the police believe he committed the crime alone. Although there was no trauma that would link the body of the infant directly to the cause of death, police officials said, We plan to conduct an autopsy to ensure the exact cause of death. Police will seek an arrest warrant after investigating whether the baby was killed and abandoned, and whether the abandoned baby was killed.`` If you don't have enough time to work, you won't be able to get paid in advance, can you? '' said a recent labor union official, p.p.communist.com, CBS News ' author, and no-cutting. Moon Jae-in, while promoting the (→ 52 hours 68 maximum working hours per week) workers were government workers ‘Act 2 life’ seed money of the retirement accounts, you can.Fears are growing. In particular, the issue of severance pay has emerged as a bomb, as the National Assembly's environmental labor committee and the ruling and opposition party tentatively agreed to give only 1.5 times the holiday allowance, one of the biggest issues in revising the Labor Standards Law. Severance pay is calculated by multiplying the average monthly wage by the continuous wage. If an average worker worked for 20 years before he or she retired, he or she will be paid 100 million won ($ 150 million) in severance pay. The problem is that when working hours are short, overtime is limited to 12 hours per week, so the pay is also reduced. A reduction in the allowance would of course reduce the average wage and the severance pay. A reduction in working hours → an decrease in the average wage → a decrease in severance pay, which is why many workers are expected to demand an interim payment for their retirement before shorter working hours. However, the Workers ’ Compensation and Welfare Service Act strictly limits the reason for the interim settlement to buy a home or rent of a home, or to pay for an injured person, or to pay per person's recovery fee. The retirement fund aims to prevent reckless interim settlement, as it is designed to prepare workers for retirement. Reduction in working hours, currently under discussion by the National Assembly, is not a reason for interim settlement. However, if labor unions raise the issue actively, the situation could be different. The wage peak system was not originally included in the reason for the interim settlement of severance pay, but was added when the retirement age extension law went into effect last year (age 60). It is time for the government and the National Assembly to meet labor demands. Labor unions are demanding that holiday allowances be doubled from the current 1.5 to 1.5 times to avoid shorter working hours and wage preservation for shorter working hours. The business community says workers must accept wage reductions. The government has introduced a retirement pension system since 2005 that allows financial institutions to provide severance pay to help guarantee workers their retirement and reduce corporate burdens. Retirement pension is more difficult to settle in the middle than severance pay. As of June this year, however, only 54.4 percent of Korean workers have signed up for pension funds. Nearly half of the workers still receive severance payments, which are directly operated by businesses. Even if the pension is converted to a retirement pension, if the majority of workers agree, it can be restored to the retirement payment system run by businesses themselves. Any business establishment with a strong union can ask for interim settlement by converting retirement funds. If the majority of workers demand interim payments, the company will have to deal with a huge "" bomb. "" For businesses, it is highly likely that they will experience a double precision bomb to settle the retirement pay, as well as additional job burden resulting from shorter working hours. If the interim settlement is made with a labor-management agreement, the government has no reason to stop it, said an official of the labor sector. Against this backdrop, the labor community has launched an exercise of power to block the ruling and opposition parties ` tentative agreement on shorter working hours. The two umbrella organizations 28, a joint news conference a preliminary agreement as a ‘Moon Jae-in destroyed government pledges’ will be defined and are focused its protest. Some opposition lawmakers are also actively supporting the labor sector, and it is anticipated that the National Assembly's Environmental Labor Relations Commission will have to deal with the revision bill to the labor standards law.Yoo Seong-yeol, reporter of The Dong-A Ilbo, alone / Dong-A Ilbo, officially launched Facebook ; click on the hot economic issues and re-teaching methods (!) ⓒ Donga Ilbo & donga.com, illegally reprinted and distributed"

It is actively used as a complement to relieve the fatigue and burden of open social networking services, which are widely shared by too many.According to the global photo and video SNS Instagram on July 27, the number of daily users of the "" story "" function in Instagram last August reached 300 million in November. A story is a simple feature that disappears after 24 hours. The number of more than 100 million has increased in seven months since the country first surpassed 200 million in April. Instagram's auto-deleasing feature captures the story screen and shows the remaining publishing time at the top of the content. It was also rapidly introduced to domestic information technology services. Naver's video SNS snow, which recorded 200 million cumulative downloads as of October, can be interpolated with images of 10 seconds and automatically exploded messages within a set time. Kakao also added an XML GIF chat feature to its Kakao Talk cheese in October. You can create and share your own moving image, called an XML moving picture, by attaching a sticker to your own photos, which automatically disappears after 24 hours. The increase in volatile content, also called "" self-destruction, "" is largely due to the shift in communication from words to images and pictures by SNS users. They say that teenagers who are used to expressing their feelings with images rather than text, but who are also sensitive to personal information and privacy exposure gained huge popularity and quickly became popular. Among social networking sites, the first target audience was teenagers targeted by Snapshop, who introduced volatile content. As a result of analyzing 800 million account accounts, teenagers are seeing four times more story content and posting six times more stories than users of different age groups, Instagram officials explained.Another reason for the automatic explosion is that the contents can be shared in a creative and new way without burden, as the contents are not floating around on social networking sites. Because of this, Naver and Kakao are upgrading their decorating function as well as taking pictures and video. Instagram continues to work so that the story contents won't show any comments or ' yes '. This is to differentiate the Internet users from the online social networking sites that need to pay attention to other people's responses.""
