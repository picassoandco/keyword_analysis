As one of the island's many natural seaweed farms, one of the islands was called Munghae Island, it was not possible to collect seaweed. After the Seongba Island was located on the island of Seongdo Island during a steep accident in 1968 Aerial photography from Kwak. If you run for more than three hours by sea, 40 kilometers from Jindo, Jindo-gun, South Jeolla Province, you will see one of the most remote islands in front of you. East China Sea that is laid out if you go a little more from here. The name of the small island with 20 soccer stadiums combined is Gwangdo Island. Maeng-gol-do Guo Tu is a neighbor, who belong to, Jodo-myeon, Jindo-gun, Jeollanam-do, in administrative districts of Jukdo, as well as the Islands, maenggol one of the island. Heat resistant plant is installed in of three manned, in the Islands, maenggol to Maeng-gol-do Jukdo and a 1km away from Maeng-gol-do Guo Tu, juseom is with how the island. Unlike Manggoldo, which is well known among fishermen, Gwang-do is a remote island that not only is known to Jindo but also to residents of Jodo-myeon. There are various theories as to the origin of the island's name, Kwak Do. As natural seaweed grows naturally around the island, it was also called ‘ Gaea Island, ’ but, judging by the people of Jindo Island calling it Kwak, it is possible to describe the island in Chinese characters when it is overrided. There is another story. Since ancient times, this island has been known to have named Gwangdo with bean leaves attached to it, after growing a lot of beans and holding them as a main dish. The Sea Explorer Lighthouse looks around Gwangdo Island. Other than the fact that Lee Jae-eon's resident registration record shows that the population is the furthest from the nine-house 16 mark, there is another reason Kwak is relatively unknown. Gwangdo Island is where people are not allowed to approach it due to its steep seawater and high waves. As there is no proper dock, even if the weather is not good enough, ferries often come and go to the right before the island. It is a very unfavorable condition for a person to settle down. Maybe that's why. In the 1970s, more than 60 people lived together in harmony with Kwak's present resident registration record of 9 families. At the same time, only 3 grandmothers lived there. There is a very sad story that Gwangdo became the island of lonely grandmother. As you can see, the Mungol Sea, where Gwangdo Island is situated, was the scene of the Sewol tragedy in April 2014. About 50 years ago, in the autumn of 1968, a sea accident happened that killed nine people at once right there. Six residents of Gwangakdo, where relatives were married, took a slow-slowing ferry to the nearby Seonju-cho in the late afternoon. As the ferry was not in service to Gwangakdo at the time, they moved to Gwangakdo in a sailing boat. With the intention of hurrying home The tragedy took place at the tip of the Manggol capital, with Kwak Do, the home of life and the final destination of the project, in front of his face. With only about 700 meters to Kwak, the wind and the waves were mixed, and the sailing boat sank into the sea. It was a disaster that happened in the blink of an eye with the villagers watching. The accident killed six villagers and nine teachers. A resident is keeping a lid on the stone. Lee Jae-eon, now a 82 year old woman living in Gwangbok Island, lost her husband when he was 47 years old. Kim Du-rae (83), a neighbor of mine, left her husband in the accident. Those who lost their husbands and sons in the accident left the island one by one as if they were trying to quickly erase it from their memories. Not many residents have escaped. The story is about three people on the island, including two grandmothers. Kwak first visited the island in January 2008 with a group of public service providers called ' exclamation mark ' from Culture Broadcasting > (MBC). As if to turn the time, it is vivid that the slate roof of the 1960s and 1970s was lit with wood to cook rice and water from springs to water jars. As the island is too remote and steep to build a dock, the life of Gwangdo has never been worse. These days, however, Seomsarang No. 10 leaves Jindo Harbor once a day and enters and comes back here, the official route. By the end of the 90s, electricity was also introduced to the island. In Manggoldo Island, electricity is used as a tower, and three households evenly share the cost of 200,000 to 300,000 won per year. Every two months, the hospital ships visit Gwangdo for a general checkup. Although the island is nameless, it is full of pride that it produces the highest levels of seaweed in the nation. When the summer comes, the remaining six residents of the island return to the island to gather seaweed. They are moving back to the island for the spring months of January, also known as the "" sea discipline. "" At this time, they bring along food from the land and bloom their friendly stories with the grandmothers and their neighbors. The cultivation of the sea has long been vital, with the collaboration of wiping rocks in the winter. It is like a meaningful ceremony to announce the start of a year's farming. This is how seaweed spores stick to the rock, which is to remove weeds and grass. It is very hard to do this because of the cold winter sea breeze, but each one can expect a good harvest of seaweed in the summer. In the summer, the residents who leave the island also return to pick seaweed. Although the island was live in the 1990s, conditions are very poor. Gwanak Island produces about 20 tons of seaweed every summer. Instead of being able to cultivate the kelp and seaweed, the waves are so high in quality that they sell for a much higher price than those produced on other islands. In Gwangdo Island, seaweed has thick, sticky feet, earning about 600,000 won per person in 20 chapters. Not long ago, Jindo-gun decided to concentrate on promoting Gwangdo Island as an "" Island of Women. "" She realized that the island boasts of natural seaweed, which is good for pregnant women and other women. Among the Jindo Dongdae, the most famous natural seaweed farm is Gwangdo Island, where special products for women are produced, and is meant to be known as a place where women experience. Still, I'm afraid Kwak will soon turn into an uninhabited island if he goes like this. I guess I can only hope that the three remaining grandmothers on the island can live long and healthy. Be my best friend! [Daily Subscription] KakaoTalk [Animal People's and Animals] [KAO Hangershina Shorage : Non-redistributing and redistribution-ressed] The poverty-hungering Japanese elderly who live in poverty as basic standard of living in a pover-friendred-friendred-free District of Japan. He has recently raised another topic, the "" old man with the right attitude. "" He criticized the reality of elderly people who still need money at a later age and are forced to work "" to the point of death. "" There were various situations, such as an old man delivering newspapers due to a lack of pension, an old man working at a convenience store due to layoffs and no income, and an old man who could not afford to take care of a mother with dementia. There were also elderly people who took their own lives although their lives were important.It is the current shape of Japan that Fujita has observed, but the reality in Korea should not be much different. And it is also likely that more Korean elderly people will have to work late. A series of surveys recently released by various organizations on preparation for one's later life show a gloomy future.A survey by the retirement research institute at Samsung Life Insurance showed that 51 percent of 1,000 people in their 30s to 50s expect to work until they are 65 or older. Thirty-three percent were under the age of 65 and over, and eighteen percent were over the age of 70.The maximum age of money earned from a work life was mostly 55 years old or older, 30 % (aged over 30), and 60 to 64 % (below). That means you have to leave your job before you are 60 or 65 and work anywhere to make money until you are 70. And in reality, there are many retirements before the age of 60. The results of the research conducted by KB Financial Holding Research Institute's Golden Life Research Center showed a similar trend. The average retirement age hoped to be 65 in a survey of 2,000 adults aged 20-74. Those in their thirties and forties wanted to be 62 and 64. However, the actual retirement age was about 75, a far cry from their wishes. The highest rates were among those aged 75 and over, with 12.6 % (60-64), 9.6 % (65-69) and 7.3 % (70-74).The reason why retirement is delayed is, of course, money. They have not saved enough money for retirement, and that is not to say that the government's welfare system is robust. It is not the time when children are encouraged as before. A poll of urban people in their 30s - to 50s by the Institute of 100 years of age NH Investment and Securities found that 61.7 % of respondents said they would get less than 1.5 million won in retirement income. The income of a two-person households with a median income of 27.7 million won and less than 50 percent of the median income (1.39 million won) are classified as poor. It is interpreted that many of them end up working as poor people.In an interview with The World Ilbo in the past, Fujita said, "" It is important to recognize problems in advance, to prepare and implement measures to address poverty among the elderly. "" And to say, "" It is important for the poor, who have a lot of welfare funds to fall. ""Lee Jin-kyung, reporter at ljin@segye.com"

"Ha Myeong-soo, the member of the IMF's generation, says, ' We want to do the same thing since the IMF's 20 years ago, but with full-time workers and non-regular workers sharing the same jobs, the largest employers in the current generation of students are fighting with their younger brothers and sisters The fact that there were no disasters that did not go through the Sewol accident, the MERS incident, or the Pohang earthquake in the modern history of Korea, how much hardship would the postponement of the CSAT be? Ha Myung-soo (42, Deputy Director of large shipping company), the first generation, was the only student to take the College Scholastic Ability Test twice and suffered from difficulties due to the 1997 financial crisis before graduation. Cha Hyun-ki (35, Hyundai Heavy Industries Company partner Lee Eun-control) is said to have gone through the book, ` 880,000 won generation `, which predicts the salary of 880,000 won per month. One year earlier than Cha, Lee In-ho (34, GM solutions representative), said, "" If you do well, you will go to college, you will be able to taste one of the most difficult college entrance exams. "" Jin Eun-hye (28, a candidate for the national college entrance examination), who took the College Scholastic Ability Test in 2008, underwent an endless change in the college entrance exam system, in which one third of her grades were reflected. Jeong Jang-hee (22, Sookmyung Women's University), who spent four years on the national college entrance exam in both an easy and difficult B, is called the only student who took the national entrance examination, Maruta, and Salgeori generation. A fifth generation man and woman who met at Hankook Ilbo headquarters at 7:30 p.m. on July 9 retold their stories at loose. How unfair I am! The modern history of Korea is a turbulent history. Political chaos, the worst economy, and an insane entrance examination system have been hampered by this. Who would be the most unjust generation? Ha Myung-soo, who was hit hard by the Asian financial crisis (from the right), Jin Eun-hye, a former competitor who went through an endless competition since his school days, and Cha Hyun-ho, an experiment by university students at the headquarters in Seoul, as an example. Hong In-gi - Why do you think you are such an unjust generation? Let's talk about the difficulties that each generation has faced. Ha Myung-soo (age of IMF) : "" I was the first generation to take the CSAT and I took it for the first time and for the last time I took it twice. After the IMF burst, he retired from the army in March 1999 and worked on the refrigerator production line at Samsung Electronics ’ home appliance plant in Gwangju. I applied to send a messenger to cover my tuition. I worked for 9 months without making any public announcements because I don't think any college students would accept it. When I was in college, I had a senior degree in 88 or 90 years, but I was not worried about getting a job until the class of 90. Applications came to the schools to recommend students, and there were also big businesses that asked them to apply. By the time the class of 91 graduated, the IMF was broken up and it was a totally different world.Cha Hyun-gi, the 880,000 won generation member of the family said, After graduating from the school in February 2008, the subprime financial crisis broke out. I didn't think of getting a job. Busan, his hometown, did not have a big company like Seoul, so the labor shortage felt much worse. I graduated from the Department of Trade and Trade at Dongseo University in Busan, and I learned a separate programming skill to get a job. He first entered small and medium businesses, and was full-time, such as non-regular workers. It was a job that would disappear at any time and would disappear with the company. The gap between the annual salary of large companies was also huge. I saw the book, ` 880,000 Generation ` when I was in college, and I thought it wouldn't make any sense at the time, but it was exactly right when I saw Lee In-ho (age of high school), who was studying for Lee Hae-chan (age : Han-chan). After entering high school in 1999, the palm tree was destroyed when the education reform policies of then Education Minister Lee Hae-chan was implemented. I played palm when I was in middle school, but I did not do it when I was in high school. I learned table tennis and go after class around 5 p.m. Those who wanted to learn musical instruments learned musical instruments. He was a freewheeling generation. It may be said that I received benefits in that regard, but the problem was the CSAT. In the previous year, the CSAT was so easy that there were 66 perfect candidates, but suddenly it was too hard for me to do it. The number of students who took the test was several times higher than last year. I was so nervous that I wrote down all the answers wrong. As all of them applied downward, they failed to make the decision on which university to go, and even Yonsei University and Seoul National University did not have enough money. Many students could not go to college because they were accepted at regular intervals and failed to pass the minimum score on the CSAT. When I went to college, I got drunk and held my senior in front of me and cried, ' I was going to go to a university. ' I played a lot in college, but it wasn't easy to get a job. It is regrettable that I have played so much, "" said Lee In-ho, a member of the Lee Hae-chan generation, "" when I was in middle school, I studied at night to get to a good high school, but when I entered high school, the education minister's education reform policy began again. ""Jin Eun-hye (the younger generation), an unlimited rival, said, "" I am quite the opposite. It was a place where friends and foes coexist due to competition for entrance into the university. Higher school grades have increased due to a sudden change in entrance rates. There was also a great deal of relative assessment. Thirteen national college entrance exams, or 12 school records (mid-term and final exams during the three and a half years), and one exam were reflected in the admission process. Our school took four exams per semester, dividing the Korean language, English, mathematics and rote subjects, and eight tests per year were reflected in the grades. He had to take the university entrance exam every day. Friends could not but rival. Some people were consumed with competition while others fell behind. I had three friends who dropped out after the first test of my first year in high school. There were even rumors that competitive schools in Gangnam secretly tore off their friends ' notebooks. The CSAT was given an absurd rating system. The second grade with 88 points and the second with 78 points were the same grade. Since he had no distinction, he saw his essay as well as his grades. My parents don't give me private lessons, but when I was a senior in high school I went to an essay institute. We discussed Socrates who had never learned. She said, "" I could not afford to go to college because I couldn't afford to go to college. As I was about to graduate from university, I was waiting for an unlimited competition to get jobs. Life was competition, "" said Jin Eun-hye, an ever-present, competitive college entrance exam policy from high school, adding, "" Schools are a place of friends and enemies. ""# Unbelieving generation gathered together and commiserated with each other and felt deprived as they moved to the next generation. "" Jeong Jang-hee (Our generation of Maruta), who led the Maruta experiment, expressed her gratitude. He said he had a system of admissions officers when he was in high school, and that it was not the time when he went to college because he studied well. I prepared a lot to do a lot of overseas activities with the club and get a lot of prizes. It was during our generation that the national college entrance examination was divided into the easy A and the difficult B sections. I had to decide whether to look at A-A or B-B for the university I wanted to apply to, but my friends were confused because they had to go to the university. Some of my friends were afraid that if my friend moved to type A, I would get worse grades. The English AB type disappeared immediately next year. In addition, it was not easy for him to take the CSAT compared to last year's. There were many stories of failure to control difficulty. I did not even know how to reflect it when it was different from the ones with type A and B with type 100 points, and I had a lot of trouble finding out when I filed the application. "" - We share the job description. Generation Lee Hae-chan : I saw the job posting in front of the department office when I was in college. It was an annual salary of 22 million won, but I remember saying, ' I would rather not get a job than get this money. ' I got a job 10 years later, but I got only a few hundred thousand won more. The trend of getting a job has changed during my university years. She said she will choose the test subjects when she was in third and fourth grade from 2008 to 2009, but she said she should have a story by the time she graduated in 2010. At that time, I wrote over 100 resumes and I was busy lying every day. After preparing to work for a year or so, he went into the depths of depression and decided to fall asleep. I gave up about a year, I wrote down, I loved writing, I couldn't look back and go through puberty when I was a kid. "" "" Unlimited competitive generation = I could get a job. Many of my friends go to their home countries because it is hard to get help from their parents. As I tried to get part-time jobs or to work at a non-school company but kept writing applications to other companies, I found that many of my friends, who applied for basic jobs at a private university, would find a job at any university.Generation Maruta : The biggest concern of our generation is jobs. I heard that I can get a job anywhere if I can go to Seoul, go to private academies a lot, go to private academies and speak English well during my junior high and high school days, but now that I have been able to get a job, English is basic. I worried all through college whether I should speak a second language. They find contests, an overseas activity, and an intern, but it is now too hard to become an intern. I sent an Internation letter a few hours ago, and I feel like I'm losing it. I thought I had lived a good life, but I didn't do much compared to others. It is very confusing to see local talent policies that allow students to hire blinds to distinguish between school and university grades, and provide incentives to graduates of provincial universities. If it comes to this"
"I think I can tell you why I came to Seoul. When he graduated from college, the global financial crisis turned out to be rather absurd than difficult. I heard from my university friends that my superiors went to Samsung and LG, but I found out that they were lies. It was so hard that it was nothing but bravado. Employment at big companies was completely blocked. However, expectations of salaries vary depending on the age of the people in the region. As for our subcontractor in heavy industry, the starting salary for our company is between 30 million won and 40 million won, but new employees in their 20s expect 70 to 80 million won. We have also seen many companies in Gyeonggi Province earning less than 20 million won a year, said Cha Hyun-gi, a 880,000 won generation student, who was in a global financial crisis when he graduated from college, completely blocked employees from major businesses.- After all, it appears that the Korean society is talking about the hard-hearted aspects of the IMF. Generation of IMF : "" It is the result of the IMF's involvement 20 years ago. There are classes in this society, not classes. It's like having a fight with a giant kabe. Why should there be a difference between regular and irregular workers in doing the same thing? You can apply the same pay, but you can fight it out by saying, "" You should survive too. "" Some think they could be the same. "" Generation Lee Hae-chan = "" And while being laid off from the IMF, his colleagues did. ' If you don't get fired, I get fired."" Competition grows more competitive, so it creates more conflict. "" Although I am the same age as my rival generation, sometimes it is scary to talk to friends who walk the coal path in a good company. He talked as if he were a temporary worker or a management employee of a company. I felt a sense of distance when I saw a friend who said, "" I felt bad because I used to treat myself to the same position with my meal. "" Obviously the friend would do the same thing because he saw the organizations neglect the employees. I wanted to point out, but I was afraid it was because you couldn't get a job for long and you tried a temporary worker for long. It's scary and sad. "" "" The Maruta generation = "" I saw my father and felt a lot. The company did everything it could to get him to leave his father, who was due in early 2013 when he was in high school. He sent a young employee from Seoul to scold him or sent him away on business trips. One day he told me it was hard, but when I said ' Father happiness first, ' he quit after three days. I had to go through two years even though I was having a hard time because I had a lot of money to go to university. Having seen the sight, I do not prefer large businesses. Rather than sacrificing all of our time to the company, I value the worklife. Why does the IMF happen in the "" IMF Generation = "" text? I heard that you learn because of the prodigal consumption culture .... "" "" Maruta generation = "" I don't know. Didn't I study hard?"" The IMF generation = "" is wrong by a few, and the harm is always seen by good citizens. I wonder if the textbooks teach me the reason for the IMF. Hong In-gi - I heard various stories. Do you agree? - Are you angry at the reaction of other generations? ▽ Uncompetitive competitor generation = I can think of a comment. A friend posted a message saying, ' cursed 08 student numbers ' when she decided to repeat, and the comment ' whiny while eating my parents give me a meal. ' Last year I experienced a similar conflict with my mother. Because of the long preparation for work, my mother said, ' If you've given me this much support, get out of it. ' But I have something I want to do. There is a slightly higher and more desirable position. Because of the influence of the older generation, the job market is very tight. Please wait a little while. ' She said, "" You're living a life for the elderly. Why curse the older generation? ' I don't like older people, and they don't understand how the next generation is going to suffer from competition. "" "" Maruta generation : No, I've got a job. ""The reaction is '. ' However, these days, it is not possible to work hard for a job. My parents ' generation was not understanding their generation. "" I wasn't convinced to talk about Lee Hae-chan's generation = "" The lowest academic record since Dangun, "" he said. Who says so on what basis? How can I compare myself when I did not take the same CSAT ... However, I feel rather sorry about my age. I guess I was lucky enough to get a job. "" - What changes would you like to make in our society? What if I just pick one?The Maruta generation : "" We should get rid of the prejudice that only good students should handle honor students. There is a strong trend that those who study well go to good universities, and those who go to good universities can get jobs in good places. I was taught not to be different from other people at school. If you behave differently, you were pointed out as wrong. But when I entered university, I asked her to emphasize something different from the others. When I tried to get a job, I asked, ' What makes you different from other people '. I was stressed out when I suddenly asked for individuality and creativity when I learned to do the same thing with others throughout elementary school and high school. Some people can dance, some people can play music well, but they must be recognized and nurtured by abilities. I want to make a society where individuality is respected. I read in the book, "" The Uncompetitive Generation =, "" where three classes coexist. Old people who have lived in traditional societies, middle-aged people who have passed through industrialization, and young adults who have been post-industrial. What is right or wrong? I hope society will come, not weird in its pursuit of happiness, and admitting to different values. Even now, it is said that our society needs to force a ' normal ' and get a job if it is or not, and get married at this age. There are many people who dream of different lives in my generation. I want to choose. "" Unit of 880,000 won = "" The problem is the culture of comparison and discrimination. I saw a customer ask an employee, ' What are your parents doing? ' at a convenience store. When I said, "" I work for Hyundai Motor, "" he asked, "" Is it a direct management? "" Elementary school children have direct parents and sub-contractors parents play separately at school. In addition, the children of the government officials and employees also eat separately. Children learn by watching their parents ' generation behave with this kind of attitude. Small companies compete with each other, and employees knock down their competitors to get a little higher pay. The more competitive and conflicted, the more selfish they are and discriminate. It feels like competition is embedded in every generation. "" What are the names that the unjust generation gave to each other or to each other? The Lee Hae-chan generation chose to name the positive ' Oxygen Class ', the affluent ' 8.88 Million Won Generation ' and the IMF generation's pioneering ' Hansel and Gretel Generation. ' Hong In-ki, journalist Lee Hae-chan : "" We must close the wage gap between big and small businesses. This is why it is so difficult to get a job. Only about 10 percent of the large companies are willing to go there. The first step to solve this problem is to let the troubled and competitive-infested society breathe : "" IMF generation = "" The electoral system should be changed. In the end, if anything desired is to be achieved, we have to go to politics, and the current structure, with only one winner in the district, makes it difficult to reflect the voices of small groups, minorities and certain classes. I think the lawmakers acted for the vested interest and the wealthy during my ignorance. The electoral system should be changed to reflect the diverse voices. That is the only way to solve social problems, such as temporary workers. "" - What if they were given a new name in hopes of their generation?I don`t think the direction of former minister Lee Hae-chan's policies has been wrong. As a result, they are in the right direction, even if they have a bad influence. I would like to call it the positive name that comes to mind when I graduate from school, World Cup class, or Oxygen (O2) class. What's wrong with Lee? `` I'd like to make it the 880,000 won generation = "" 8,000,000,000 won generation.

I would like to name it the "" Unlimited competitor generation = "" Hansel and Gretel generation. The animals in the forest were lost eating snacks, but like the fairy tale of winning a witch and returning home, the IMF generation has lost the thought of returning to their former prosperity and "" but has overcome the challenge. "" These days, I looked at my report card from middle school and high school because I can read it even in the civil service. When I was in junior high school, my dream was to become a rocker, but when I moved to high school, I turned into a lawyer and a diplomat. The keen competition prevented other dreams.

The president is the 15th, one in Beijing, China, against some 300 students of the concession speech, and to mollify China.

Beijing's wide acceptance with the law as its main advantage is what makes China a great country, the official said. We would like to express our deep applause for Xi, who said he would continue to form a human destiny community under a win-win and more open strategy. China should show more engagement and tolerance as the whole situation is the president also emphasized. It is interpreted that the sade conflict between the two countries is in mind.

We have made an important foundation to change one by one.Beijing : Kang Jun-gu, a journalist at eyes@kmib.co.kr, When the central bank and foreign news agencies were combined on July 16, central bank governors and dignitaries decided clearly that virtual currency like Bitcone was not money. Janet Jellen, Chairman of the Federal Reserve (Fed), on July 13 (local time), referred to Bitcone as "" a highly speculative asset and not a reliable way to store value. "" Although the price of Bitcone has soared around the world recently and investment is running wild, they made it clear that they can not be included in traditional currency categories. Yellen also said, Bitcone has so far played a very small role in the payment market, underestimating the possibility of expanding its presence in the financial market. European Central Bank (ECB) director Mommesche also told the ECB, which will be co-sponsored by the Bank of Italy on July 30, "" Virtual currency is not money, "" and "" Europeans are more likely to bet on virtual currency. "" Buying virtual currency is more of a gamble than an investment, "" said Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz on July 14. Virtual money can not be seen as money because it does not have reliable value storage, Polos said, expressing a similar perception to Jellen. Recently, Bitcone's price movement was even compared to the IT bubble 20 years ago. As Philip Laure, Australia's central bank chief, told a payment meeting in Sydney on July 13 that "" the current rush to these coins (virtual bills) is more about speculative than the efficient and convenient use of electronic payments. "" The central bank warned of the virtual currency boom by shaking the foundations of its unique business of issuing legal currency and monetary policies.Citizens who pass by a virtual currency exchange are watching a screen with virtual currency rates. One of the basic characteristics of money is that it is not suitable for money because it can not guarantee its value stability while its price is constantly floating. The central bank's view is not much different from other major countries '. Even with the example of BIS, virtual money can not be seen as money, BOK Gov. Lee Joo-yeol said in a parliamentary audit last October. We will make the regulations as a product, not as a monetary regulation, he said. Shin Ho-soon, vice president of the Bank of Korea, also told a payment settlement conference on July 2, "" Virtual currency fluctuations, including beatcore, are not yet possible due to legal characteristics or definitions, and consences (consensus agreement on price) were made.

"● Unknowable, Public or Unreleased … In the past audit session of the Google, Apple, and Facebook at the National Assembly, there was a rare opportunity to view the face of global IT companies. At the confirmation audit by the Ministry of Information and Communication on October 30, National Assemblymen Kim Kyung-jin asked Korean delegates from Apple, Facebook, and Google what their domestic sales were. Apple and Facebook had no idea how much Korean sales were, and Google had said something a little. "" Sales are open to the public in some areas, but not in others because it is a sensitive issue, "" said Google Korea Representative John Lee, "" but don't let it open to the public. "" It meant that although I knew about Korean sales, I could not disclose them to the public. KT Chairman Hwang Chang-kyu (left) is sworn in as witnesses at the National Assembly's parliamentary audit session of the Science and Technology Information Broadcasting Commission at the National Assembly on Monday. From the right of Hwang's back row, Apple Chairman Richard Yoon, Naver founder and global investment manager Lee Hae-jin, Samsung Electronics President Ko Dong-jin, and LG Electronics Vice Chairman Kwon Young-soo (photo = Yonhap News Agency) were more important. Google responded to a parliamentary audit that saw Chief Lee Hae-jin and Facebook immediately say, "" We don't know how much we're making, and we're not paying taxes. "" It is not uncommon for heads of big businesses like Naver to cling to certain businesses during parliamentary inspections. Google Korea, for its part, wanted to protest because it did not want to be hit alone when it was criticized for arranging articles.On November 2, Google Korea released a rare report on the tax issue and stated "" Google is paying taxes in Korea, and it is adhering to the local tax law and tax treaty. "" It was like Google, the global powerhouse of IT, responding to Naver's fight. Naver did not want to do so, and Google Korea also released its tax data again, saying it posted sales of 2.59 trillion won in 2016 and paid 277.6 billion won in corporate taxes. But the fight ended in a bland manner. That's because Google Korea didn't answer any more. So the fight against the giant IT dinosaurs has gone so quietly. ● Google's Korean sales volume is 10 % of Naver's total confidential sales reports…What is Google's revenue and tax payment amount without being required to be disclosed as a publicly held limited company, and what exactly is the amount of taxpayers ' money? The most common item when estimating Google sales is a report by the Korean Wireless Internet Industry Association. Last year's Google Play account was trading at 4.4,565 billion won, but revenues could be estimated at 1.34 trillion won since Google would take 30 % of the game. Moreover, the fact that Google is taking a huge share in the advertising market is already known in the Internet industry as common sense. Some say that the amount of money they earn from ads on YouTube and search ads is at least a few hundred to hundreds of millions won. It is clear that all businesses are likely to see an enviable sales performance in the Korean market.As I covered the report on domestic sales of Google Korea, I was able to obtain the documents that explained Google's sales figures over the past five years. No one in the industry could have checked the actual sales figures of Google Korea in Korea. It was presented to Congress and the government as an explanation, and it is a warning that it is confidential to do business and that it should not be disclosed outside. If you know the sales figures, you can estimate how much you paid for them. Since Google Korea CEO said, "" It is difficult to disclose such materials because of their sensitivity, "" I decided it would be worth it.As a result, it reported 59.4 billion won in sales in 2012, which was 940 billion won in 2015 and 267.1 billion won in 2016. The advertising sales were tallied, but the entire play store sales, etc. was missing. And there was no explanation of what ads were sold with. At least the amount of sales was a far cry from industry estimates. As of 2016, it is only 10 % of Naver's sales. It was not too much to say that the Internet is divided between Google and Naver, but it was not easy to convince Google that its sales were this good. Based on this standard, it is possible to suspect that the tax was paid only 10 % by Naver.Google pays tax to Singapore for the sale of Korean playstore ... What if it were a Korean company?Because the digital economy has no borders, it is different from the traditional concept of sales in economics. Google has no server in our country and therefore does not have a fixed business site, which the tax authorities would base on taxing. Of course, there are decent Korean branch offices and quite a few employees, but the traditional standard for taxing Internet companies has been servers. That's why Google is so ill-substantiated locally on the tax front. Taxation is difficult in itself and there are many ways to capture revenue. Users may purchase Apps from Korea, but they may also buy the App during their travels in Japan or the United States. There is ample room for businesses to make the sales in Korea big and small as they please.The ambiguous aspects of the tax burden are actively being used by Google, Facebook, Apple, and other global IT companies. Since it is a global business anyway, we can move to a country that pays as little tax as possible. Google wins sales from payment at our game store in Singapore. Singapore has a 17 % rate of corporate tax, which is lower than the 24 % rate in Korea. A complicated tax reduction technique is used to transfer loyalty overseas. In conclusion, you are paying taxes to Singapore with the money you earn in Korea. Of course, this method is still legal. The law and system is maximizing profit by taking advantage of loopholes in the digital economy. But this tax cut is far from common sense and normal law enforcement. If tax authorities catch them, they will have to pay no harm. If the amount of arrears is large, some individuals will be revealed, and some will have to pay for them by having a riot squad go to the house of the tax delinquent. If the domestic conglomerates reported only 10 percent of their sales and did not pay taxes, it is very possible that the head of the corporation would have gone to jail and the company would have disappeared without figure. Korean companies are engaged in a criminal act that is nothing short of a global tax cut. ● Facebook's surrender in European market ... What role has Facebook played in our government recently? Facebook recently announced it would change its tax payment policy to report sales from its local subsidiaries. "" It will provide greater transparency for governments and planners around the world, "" said chief financial officer David Wenner. If you reverse that, it means that so far you haven't reported any revenue to the country Facebook has entered. Facebook has a lot of users in the country, and it's even more amazing to know that it's declared unsaled. Perhaps so far, the companies who deserve jail have only made a confession that they will file a normal tax return. Although I'm going to report domestic sales from 2019 onwards, when you open the door, it can be extremely frustrating like Google. Because many criteria can apply to see how far ad sales are generated in the country. In some cases, you may want to measure the lowest revenue. And Facebook's announcement is not necessarily voluntary. The most terrifying countries in the world of Google and Facebook are the United Kingdom. Britain has shown a strong willingness to impose a tax on global businesses, and has eventually adopted a tax detour to impose a 25 % tax on profits from surrendering global businesses to offshore. We have received reports of sales since 2014, and the results of our taxes were revealed. However, Facebook paid only 6.3 million won in taxes in 2014. Britain is in a state of chaos after paying a penny-wise tax. Media criticism continued, and the government put pressure on the tax authorities to act in all directions. Facebook then paid 6.1 billion won in taxes in 2015 and 7.4 billion won last year. Yet the British people can not digest you. Sales have quadrupled during that time, because taxes have only increased by 22 percent. "" The disclosure of Facebook's tax payment results has aroused public outrage, "" the BBC said.Overall, Europe has been strict in responding to the chaos of global businesses. At a meeting of EU leaders, they discussed publicly how to tax Google and Facebook, and they called on financial ministers to come up with tax reform measures that would levy on sales. The European Commission has also filed a tax claim of 17.6 trillion won on Apple and sued the European Court for Ireland's failure to collect tax evasion. Facebook's confession took the form of a self-paiding tax payment, but it would seem more reasonable to say that it has turned red handed in the face of strong European protest against tax evacuees. There are discussions at the National Assembly and at the government level imposing taxes on global companies like Google and Facebook, but they're still cautious about talking big. Even if you ask various ministries, they are willing to watch responses to the pre-income income policies that are discussed at the OECD level. Global companies are reluctant to consider paying their taxes as a simple solution to reverse discrimination, and seek long-term solutions. If you had to report your income at will, and if you had to report it as it is, it wouldn't work. Unless the big proposition that taxes exist in the income bracket is fulfilled, only taxpayers and businesses are foolish.            Kim Soo-hyung, journalist and editor at (sean@sbs.co."

This time, a fellow worker also saw a replacement for the lock on his face. Furthermore, the person found that even the exchanged product caused the same problem, and had to exchange the exchanged item again. On July 15 (local time), the IT professional phone Arena introduced a Chinese woman's iPhone X-Exchange. Chinese businessman Jan (Yan) also found that her iPhone X was unlocked with the face of her colleague. Jan and her colleague drove to the Genius Bar and explained the problem. Ginnier's Bar is Apple's unique professional technical support center. Jan explained, "" The face recognition system that should be unlocked with my face only, is also released with the face of a colleague who is here with me. "" and demonstrated the problem directly. "" It looks like the true-depth camera is malfunctioning, "" said an employee of the Ginnier's Bar, and replaced the product.However, the same problem arose with the exchanged product and was exchanged for a new one. It is not known whether Jan received the third iPhone X, the phone Arena said.Rather than turning off fingerprint recognition, the iPhone X has installed the face-recognition system, the face ID. Face IDs work by dividing the user's face by 30,000 points. The sensors on the front will shoot infrared light and read into the true-depth camera. Based on this, each individual is identified.Apple explains, "" It is one-millionth possible for a non-registered user to unlock with a face ID. "" It is more secure than one fifth of fingerprint recognition.However, the problem of face ID errors has continued since the release of iPhone X.Last September, there were cases of children not being able to distinguish faces. "" Among children under 13, twins and siblings who have similar faces were not fully developed and therefore had a different statistical probability, "" Apple said on its official website. In November, IT professional media McShable pointed out the problem of face ID, which distinguishes identical twins. A video clip posted on Redit, a social news website, on the same month said, "" Face ID can not distinguish between siblings, not twins, "" creating a stir.Apple recommends using conventional password locks if you are worried about the problem of face ID errors.A video clip posted on a social news website Redit last November.

Armed with thick coats, masks, and gloves to fight against the cold weather, he is headed to Exit 2 of Guro Station on Line, the nation's largest labor market.Chung (54), who visits the labor market every day, has worked as a general manager for what is called the "" miscellaneous department "" for 10 years. "" I have done all the other work, but I have not earned it this much, "" he said with a wry smile. "" I could get 80 (10,000 won) a month for a part-time job at a convenience store over there. "" He stomped and knocked in front of an unopened workforce office near Namguro station. In the cold winter, you don`t have any work to do unless you get to work early, Jeong said, It is a success that you can have if you visit for a month and work half.After 4 a.m., the job center was opened, and Jeong submitted her resident registration card to the person in charge and waited for work. If a worker registers with the labor office who wishes to work day, the person in charge will call out his or her list and take it to the scene whenever he or she has work available. Instead, the office would take 10 percent of the daily wage off for introducing them to work. There is a way not to lose 10 percent of the fees. It is directly employed by the construction site manager who visited the station. Most people who stand on the streets of Namguro station waiting for the bongosa are like this. Hana Bank is packed with Chinese workers and Korean workers on the other side of the road.Around 4:30 in the labor market, which was divided into two branches in China, X Korea, was crowded with people who came to look for work. It looked well over 500 people. The Namguro labor market is divided into the areas where Chinese and Korean day laborers gather. On the street where Hana Bank is located, Chinese workers flocked to the bank, and on the other side of the sidewalk, Korean workers were gathered. Many Chinese workers do not speak Korean. The reporter walked up to him and asked, "" Can you speak Korean? "" He shook his head and avoided most of the seats.    Lee, 48, a native of China, said, "" We have seen a great number of Chinese immigrants this year. "" Lee said, Many of the Chinese who gathered here were either illegal visa free or visited Korea through tourist visas. As many people are getting poor from China, he said, As they fill the job market, labor costs do not go up but Korean people have less and less places to live. The Chinese have a half-half who does odd jobs, but many work as carpenters who handles lumber. Carpenters are hard to do but they have three to 40,000 won more per day. Most ordinary workers get about 120,000 won per day, but a carpenter can get 150,000 to 160,000 won. They were all carrying large bags, filled with tools for the scene. To that end, there were even merchants selling tools and gloves on the streets of Chinese workers.A nearby A manual office official explained, "" Ninety percent of the carpenter's working day here is Chinese, but I have no choice but to use them because they are more willing than I like them. "" He said, "" We did it when we had money.Now young people are saying, "" Here in Korea, we are doing manual labor, we are doing manual labor, we are doing chores to do a lesser degree, rather than performing manual labor. "" In the southern district of Guro, Chinese and Korean workers looked more like Chinese workers. "" Aunt ... I'll go. "" A 46-year-old man, unable to stand the cold, entered into a small tent to distribute tea around a fireplace. Mr. Park, who is melting his swollen hand. I wore a heavy padding jacket, but I couldn't stand the whole body frozen as I stood in the breeze for nearly two hours. The Seoul Metropolitan Government announced on July 10 that daily workers would establish a shelter in the labor market to avoid the cold. However, there was only one small tent on the site where district volunteers distributed tea to Korean and Chinese workers, but there was no shelter from the cold.A worker squeezed in the tight tent to make sure he couldn't stand the cold anymore. As soon as I walked into the small tent, an average worker, Park (46), said, Aunt ... I'll have my hands warm. The volunteer who was passing out the car in the tent was perplexed, but could not ask him to leave. With his swollen hand on the stove by the kettle, he said with a good look, "" I'll melt a little and go. "" Volunteers said, It's cold and they sell about 750 cars a day. The day laborers managed to get over the cold by the car in paper cups, standing in front of a tent near the nearby supermarket or crouching by twos and threes.Kim (58), who has worked as a construction day worker for nearly 20 years, complained, I used to get food from various groups and bring a stove to my house when I waited, but I don`t have any now. We filed a complaint with the district office near the office and disappeared at one point, Kim insisted, Come inside and get the information. People gathered on the streets do not pay fees because they are workers going directly to the scene, but they pay 10 percent when they are called to work in a labor office."" We don't know if the residents at the past labor markets had complaints about the drinking and the noise of the homeless, "" a district official said. The budget for installing a shelter at Namguro has not been allocated yet, explained the official. Around 6 a.m. when the labor market closes, a jobless worker sits in front of a bonbo for the scene. After a day's delay, he looks blankly at the street.Only half of the people were chosen ... As the construction business got worse, the Chinese people in Hana Bank disappeared completely. An expert says, "" If you can`t get to the car by 6 a.m. on the labor market, you will have to work, "" adding, "" Chinese people have a lot of illegal immigrants and go to their homes in a timely manner. ""Korean workers who spent a day on the streets of the labor market could not move easily for want.Park, 50, from Siheung, Gyeonggi-do, said, "" Most of my colleagues said they were in their first car, including Bucheon and Anyang, "" adding, "" It's okay if I work in the cold for 10 days now. "" Even in bad times, I could not take my foot off it because I was learning how to do this, "" he sighed with a cigarette. Colleagues who couldn't get jobs together stayed where they were, joking "" Why not? "" Sometimes I bring people in after 6 o'clock for work that is sometimes late, they said, smiling, "" I was waiting by chance, but today I think it's still ' going to be a day. ' ""The Construction and Economy Research Institute of Korea said yesterday that its index of business survey by SC BSI stood at 62.7 last month, down to 53.8 this month from the previous month. The index shows how companies feel about the economy, and a reading below 100 indicates that many companies expect the economy to worsen. The construction industry is worse than last year, explained Kim Won-nam, director of the Nambu Office of Human Resources Development. More than 50 percent of the day laborers on the labor market go on a fool's errand these days, Kim said, adding, If 300 people were connected with jobs a few months ago, they are currently providing 150 jobs.Ahn Seung-jin, a reporter at prodo@segye.com"
"[Hankyoreh] [Toyopan] Lee Jin-soon's open dentist Kang Chang-yong : "" I don't mind if I go to pot. I don't mind. Our dental clinic is like a sailing boat in a storm. I'm willing to lose my job and try to improve it. "" Senior reporter Kang Jae-hoon khan@hani.co.kr 3 years ago, he was suffering from excessive medical care, and he gave up on poverty when he appeared on the program. He wrote, "" I want to talk to go to YouTube, Facebook University, and I want to go to go to a high school. "" It is like a poisonous drug. Good use is bad, but bad use is bad. Some of them succeed, as they came so fiercely to get over poverty and misery and rise in society. Economic stability, decent titles and social honor are obtained, but the painful memories of the past are never erased and the desire for deprivation is limitless. More money, more honor, more status hunger and hunger are not easily met. It is a common characteristic of middle-aged people who have cherished the wounds of war and poverty as pre-integrative figures. Those who succeeded in doing so have established order for the mainstream and defined social coordinates of our times. Fortunately, there are different kinds of people in the world. Those who know the misery of poverty and do not mind poverty, and those who know the bitterness of social virtue and the pain of exclusion, who never stop being isolated from their suffering, have wistfully captured themselves. A few but not a few of these are enough to let us breathe in. Kang Chang-yong (46) is an 11-year-old dentist who graduated from Seoul National University with a degree in dentistry. Born in Seoul in 1971, he failed to go to high school due to poverty. When his friends went to college via high school, he delivered Jajangmyeon and newspapers with a medium school degree. She entered Seoul National University after passing the qualification examination late at the age of 27, but worked part-time jobs until she graduated from college to finance her tuition. In the period of high growth and unprecedented economic prosperity in the 1970s and 80s, he had no family to turn to and no adults to help. I felt destitute and lonely. After graduating from a prestigious university, he became a doctor, but he still lives as a doctor who makes no money. The hospital he runs is called the "" honesty dentist "" or "" bullying dentist. "" He is still poor and lonely. It's a path of choice. Why? I wanted to ask why do you live for what you do and why you live for what you do as a normal career, not as a priest or a social activist. In December 2017, when the year was coming to an end, I wanted to meet someone who would design time by finding their own perfect coordinates, not by floating buoys, in the wake of the times.She called the hospital several times to see a strange dentist who sees only 19 people a day, but the call was impossible. Only short recording of a doctor's appointment was repeated and the phones were automatically disconnected. Having no other way of contacting her, I went to her dentist in Mapo, Seoul. It was 3:30 p.m. on weekdays and his hospital door was closed. On the tightly closed door was a sign that said, We had closed our practice today. He knocked on the iron door recklessly, but there was no sign of it. As I waited for about 20 minutes to turn around, I wrote a note and opened the door, which had been closed heavily. After we had been talking for a while standing on the landing, he said, "" Let's go in and talk in the cold, "" and guided me into the hospital. In a few hours, he gave forth a quick stream of stories. An official interview with him was scheduled two days later. The story, which began at 4 p.m. on July 6, was long, and continued until 11 p.m., ordering Jajangmyeon. There was a notice from the entrance of the first floor of the building. "" applications for the 7:40 train, first come, first served "" Why do you start so early and close so early? "" The patients came too early and waited for me. She was here at 3 a.m. and someone was here at 2 a while ago. I have to pull it out as early as possible, but it's hard to start earlier because it's open at 7:40 a.m., and I say, "" Why don't you come in at 7:40 a.m. and have your order and your ticket for the first appointment? "" And I said, "" Why? Can I get an appointment by phone or the Internet? "" If I get a reservation right now, I will dump all my next three or four months in no time. Then you have to wait too long to see a doctor. I don't want to see many patients. Make it as uncomfortable and hard for you as possible, and you want to see only the patients who really need and need it. "" So why did you nail them down to 19? "" This is a multI-tested, trial-and-error timetable, with four people per person for 15 minutes, and 30 minutes for each person ... That's exactly 19 people by 3:15 p.m. Having four doctors and a 30-minute break can sometimes be prolonged looking at the patients in front, and if they're pushed around like that, they'll have to wait a lot. Then you can have your doctor's appointment at 3:30 or 4:00. "" Why close so early? Office workers can't come. "" I'm sorry, but I'm hungry.I haven't had lunch in nearly two years. These days, it's still a habit, so I do eat something off the go. You don't have time to go out and eat, but you can see behind it, right? "" And that's your lunchbox, right? "" No. O my! If the big one is a lunchbox ... would you like me to nose in?Do you see the plastic bag behind the bag? Have some bread or triangular gimbap prepared in advance. You can eat them on a whim. "" Director Kang Chang-yong of the Seoul Dental Clinic in Mapo-gu, Seoul, had an interview with < Hankyoreh > on July 6. When I took away the backpack, which was a reporter for senior reporter Kang Jae-hoon, I saw a small plastic bag with crumbs in it. In the past, patients stayed in the waiting room all day long and could not find time to drink or go to the bathroom, which led to the inflammation of the bladder. "" Now he's got the hang of it, "" a naughty boy smiled on his face as though he was admirable. Suddenly, he could see a desktop calendar in front of his desk. The date was marked with numbers and triangles such as ‘ 40 (7), 23 (5) … ’.What does this number mean? "" Oh, this is ... our dental bill.The numbers in brackets are the money you get from the patient, all in a card. The previous figure is the total import amount including insurance claims. "" So, today the patients paid me a total of 50,000 won and the insurance premium is 230,000? So you can stay in hospital? "" My standard price is 70 thousand won a day. That way, the hospital can stay with me, except for my regular spending. But the day when it doesn't work is ... Can you see the triangle? "" And on the December calendar, he showed almost every day with a triangle. The number of triangles on the calendar has increased since August, so it is now continued throughout the month. Since he began posting accusations of dental overdose on YouTube and Facebook, the deficit has only grown as more and more patients visit him.It's easy to be bullied, it's okay to go to the YouTube and file complaints about dental overdoses, right? I saw a video that was titled "" Dental Eye Contact Technique and Response Manual. "" "" I didn't know anything about Facebook or YouTube. When Facebook started, I didn't know the term Facebook.Who made me even when ‘Why don't you try a band’ ‘I can't sing.’ (laughter) (laughter) as SNS (sns) can ignorant man who, in June this year.From the video on YouTube and so learn to put an entire month if cases only a few decades and is viewed with Facebook so who's disappointed.Has to work together and told me. Facebook started around July. I'd report on my excess dental care on the TV program, Complaint Zero, in 2014, and I wouldn't believe anyone would tell me anything about it, no matter how I did. So I started to show you a dental photograph that I took of my teeth, and I started comparing them to it. "" So, I gave some dentists a list of patients who didn't even need dental treatment, or received dental support, and I gave them a list of patients who did. First, you should have your dental checkup at 2 or 3 different locations, get a medical certificate, compare it, and decide. So the media calls your dentist a conscience dentist or an outcast dentist. Do you agree with this expression? "" They are both right. That's the reality. The word "" conscience dentistry "" is not my creation. Dentists say, "" You're the only one with conscience?She swore, ' I'm here to talk to you about honesty and dental hygiene. ' ' Are you that good?As if ' Yes, I am proud 'You're also a bullying dentist. No wonder the dentists dislike me. Suppose someone overreached you with a small steel bar in the apartment building. Aren't the residents of that apartment building gon na do that? "" Hey, you're the one who drives down home. If you don't want to live, why go quietly and make a fuss? "" You should be conscientious in your treatment, why all the fuss about it? "" Well, isn't it hard to get criticized? `` We were almost through with seniors and juniors. There are many people who are duplicitous to comments, and there are people who are swearing at my parents. But you can't just sue me. Because the evidence is clear and I'm not saying the wrong thing. "" "" If I'm right about what I'm doing now, I'd better focus on it, "" he said. "" I'd like to accuse him of this guy and that guy, and then I'd suggest that he's going to go at it."
"It'll get cloudy. It wouldn't be a problem with overtherapy. It would be a battle between Kang and the dentists. "" So you don't use anything from the media or from patients to promote hospitals. One dentist in Gangnam said, "" I saw this as a honesty dentist on a promotional video. Restaurants put "" good restaurants "" signs at the door. "" I don't like it. I don't do anything disgraceful. I have to stay calm and focus on communicating the status of the excess care, so that I can spend my time promoting it personally and then do it for a long time? Since many patients still come to visit, I'm also asked to have a dentist's appointment with a "" joint. "" But when I make money here, I get blamed. I don't make money. "" So, is there another profit strategy that would make it worse for hospitals? "" … "" "" (Sigh) No. Anyway, my hospital is abnormal dental service. And the patients who usually come to me say, ' Do you do this prosthetic or what?' Should I tell her to implant?' Let's ask you something like this. I usually do a checkup and simple treatment. Otherwise, I can't see this many people a day. I have 19 visitors every day, but they are all neo-circulation. Usually, four to five patients in hospitals come to receive non-insurable treatment like neurotherapy, prosthetic implants, and so forth. That's how you make money. But I can't. Let's talk to the patients. This is not a dentist's office, this is a dental office.They say finding the wrong dental clinic is not something you can cure all of them. "" It's not a public institution, it's not a charity. "" I don't mind being ruined. I don't mind. Our dental clinic is like a sailing boat in a storm. If your dentist is doing well and you want to make a profit, you should never do it like this. They send everyone they want to ask for money to a different hospital without answering their phone calls. What the hell is this? I'm prepared to lose my job and talk about trying to solve this problem. "" Tears sprang up around his eyes. I didn't ask any more questions while he was trying to control his feelings.Disconnected, and the comments about the relation between older and younger alumni do was bad words to more patients to find eobyeongwon by hospital revenue day who can not fill a month needed to maintain Plenty, Moon Jae-in.To initiate care, the excessive medical care from jungyoam need manual can do if you put your mind to it in dental treatment like surgery patients, "" as you about tooth decay.Don't know?? become so absorbed in the overtreatment problem of the dentist when ― Do you have any special occasion? When I first opened, I don`t know anything either. I opened it in 2006 with two employees, and I work hard, but my sales are not good. Other dentists sell 10 golden teeth a day, but I recommend two to three inlays a week. ' Ah, the real corridor is terrible. Why in the world do people in this town have such good teeth? Is there a bad place to visit in the hospital?' I thought.Finally, I decided to close the hospital in June 2011, and I sent out all my employees. I'm doing a one-man dentistry exercise for a while to get a hospital, and I thought I'd figure out what the problem was with that few months. If I open my practice again, I need to know what I did wrong. "" But it turned out to be the doctors ' office. "" One day, a woman came to see a doctor who said she had had braces for the last two years and had been told that she had been in the hospital for three or four months and hadn't had any problems. But when I went to a dentist's office, he told me I had to have all ten cavities filled. When I checked it, it was clean. No, I would have gone to the dentist once a month to have my dental cavity filled for two years. It doesn't make any sense. So, uh, where do I report this?' I called in an email at MBC and told my friend, ' Discontent Zero. ' We covered it and showed that each dentist had to pay five million won or more to examine and treat the same patient. And when I did that, I was told by the dental service, "" Oh, this is a serious problem. I thought I'd fix it. "" "" Hmm. "" But didn't I? "" There were many such patients. And there were places where they couldn't find a single tooth decay, where they had four golden teeth glued to perfectly different healthy molars, and six months ago, they had 10 bad teeth taken out by dental clinics. But when I told her that way, even my best friend would say, ' That's because the patient is the truth. You're overstepping. "" The dental association and the dental paper also criticized me. Care is subjective and can vary from doctor to doctor. I call it a problem of over-care, and under-care. "" And he said, "" You know, you know, you know, I recommend conservative care, but I don't think it's too much of anyone with expertise to do anything with it. Wouldn't it be possible for doctors to make different judgments about the timing and scope of treatment? Let's look at cancer patients. And when you get to the tumor size, doctors are going to figure out how to get it out of the way. Sometimes I just watch without doing any surgery when I have a one-centimeter tumor. With another treatment in preference Is it because the tumor is small and it will grow anyway? Watch and don't want the stomach to be more open and closed than remove the tumor. Same thing with dentistry. When people call a cavity treatment, they know they're going to get rid of it and cover it up, but they have to dig it several times more than when they want to get prosthetic material in. "" Oh, I see. I misunderstood that the expression "" cover something "" sounds like a shield, like an armor, without the original tooth. "" When it comes to gold, we usually do neurotheral therapy, and that is actually removing and not curing it. If you remove nerves, they don't provide good nutrients to your teeth, so they can shorten their lifespan, like a black tree. "" But isn't it less painful to treat before they decay? "" Even adults in their 20s and older have slow dental decay. A male patient in his 60s showed up and another hospital asked him to do four gold teeth. She had a cavity for 30 to 40 years, but it only decayed so far. You don't have to wait another 50 years for it to decay. Besides, her gums are bad. ' Grandpa, even if it is gold, you will have to take it off first because of your gums. Don't worry about cavities and take good care of your gums. ' "" So why is it that doctors are involved in this? "" Dental treatment requires a consistent manual, like cancer surgery. If you have cavities like this, you can make a criterion of damage to the enamel, based on what's called a cut. I've made my own. If you put your mind to it, you can make it in dentistry. But why can't I make it? You have no will. Treatment for dental decay should not be subjective. We can have bad feelings because we have to make money in a capitalist society. Some dentists openly advertise that they fix skin diseases, infertility problems, and stroke problems, "" said Director Kang Chang-yong of the Seoul Dental Office in Seoul. The hospital's finances are deteriorating due to examination and simple treatment. Why not give up? So, something has to be done to restore trust between doctors and patients. "" ‘Moon Jae-in care’ To be stop overtreatment, even more important. Moon Jae-in levy is less of it to ‘do you do this, even that.’ dental care and himself are to be more. Now, the patient pays 300,000 won by the end of the day because they say, "" If you don't, it will be a big problem. "" If you don't get over the doctor's appointment, you're going to give the cat fish. There are some things that patients haven't been able to do because of the price resistance, but the dentist could make a fortune if he or she chooses to practice overtherapeuting. Sometimes it's not like you're going to the dental health, but rather than go to the dental clinic. "" What about a solution? Until when can you do that? "" We need to add dental specialists to the clinic. It doesn't cost much. Are you going to die because you have to hire two or three dentists for each health center in our budget? You can't stop the treatment from 100 percent, but if you have a non-profit -- a health center -- a dental clinic -- that checks and diagnoses you according to the manual for your public health -- you're playing the role of public health service providers. "" Can we add more doctor-attached dentists? "" There are many different kinds of dentists. Some doctors would be willing to sign up as contract workers for childcare. Some doctors are in their 60s and older and difficult to work at regular dental clinics. They could set a working day and make it a contract. It's a good opportunity for doctors. "" Now, you've been raising this issue for the past four or five years, and you've become an outcast rather than getting encouragement or support from dentists. What is the most hurtful thing you've ever heard? "" You can call me shit. There was a comment that said, "" The poop gets tangled. "" I'm the shit, and the patients who find me are the scum. Well, that's okay. The words on my chest ... I said to my patients, "" You have no money. "" (Screaming) Oh, I actually read them and I cried in the nursery. It's okay to treat me like shit. But when I call my patient a "" beggar, "" I get a fever. I don't know how big and scary it is. And people who say that, they judge patients by their money. Is it a sin to have no money? How do I make a man out of money? "" He burst out crying as if he couldn't stand it any more. He still has the bitterness of the days when he was treated as a ' beggar. ' "" When I was homeless and starved for food, "" he knows, "" the cold, cold reception and social contempt can be a bitter pain for the ' the poor '. While preparing for qualification examination later, while doing Gaudo in institute, hungry frost"
"I cried myself out in a mock test. Even after entering university, he worked as a part-time tutor and provided tuition until almost 2:00 a.m. every day. So far, he has not forgotten the lesson of life that poverty is not a sin but a pain that our society will embrace.You've come all the way here after all the hard work, but didn't you think you wanted to make a living off the fat? "" I wanted to be a doctor because I wanted to be like Dr. Chang Ki-ryeo. If I had a lot of food, a lot of money to live and lose, would I have done this now? I'm sure you must be busy traveling abroad with money. If you have God, I may have given you a lot of hard times to do this right now. "" Why not be criticized, not given the money, not the one who doesn't? "" (Eye round) You're wrong! Call it wrong, and you say, why not give up?Is ' ' neun ' correct? I saw something wrong. I'm not trying to fix it, I'm just saying it's wrong and you give it up? Where are we going to give up? "" And people say, "" Oh, that's a good idea. ' You're right, but you can't change it alone. Don't go out alone. ' "" It's a battle of confidence. My greed is thinking I'm going to change everything about the treatment I overreach in a short time. To the best of my ability, I will go. Then someone will start over there again. After thinking about it, I felt better. Would the world be so fortunate? I don't know … I'm going to keep doing this whether I can or not. I won't give up. "" It was sleeting outside the window. The heat was turned off in the dentist's office a long time ago, but it didn't feel cold. "" As far as I can, not give up … "", his voice penetrated his chest as if it were pouring hot water on his heart. Shim Ji-yeon : Time to Make Kang Chang-yong.

"○ Local Rehabilitation Joint Authority with Young Blood and Baiko When the tree was cut down 80 percent, KuroI and Daichi (32) pushed the tree down with a excavator. They said, "" We are collecting furniture from the forest.They are members of the Sagawa government's Regional Reconstruction Cooperation Committee. The Japanese government has operated the Regional Renaissance Development Cooperation Center program since 2009, which moves young people in the city to areas with a sharply diminished population. The ministry said it is seeking to inject young blood into rural areas, where the low birthrate and aging population have diminished and workers. The Act provided that urban youth would apply for public recruitment when local administrative bodies post ads for projects such as agriculture or development of village specialty goods needed for their home towns. If selected, they will go down to work in the district for three years as a temporary employee. It started as 89 people in 2009 and has grown to 5,000 this year. The number of participating local governments has increased from only 31 out of 1,888 to 1,000 this year. Members of a local regeneration team cut down Japanese cypress trees in the forest of Sagawajeong Pavilion in southern Japan Thursday. The Japanese government has been operating the Regional Renaissance Cooperative University program since 2009, which sends young people in their 20s and 40s to local cities and countryside. / Lee Dong-huI, a special correspondent, lives in a house provided by the local government and receives KRW 36 to KRW 46,000,000 per year in monthly or activity expenses. Since the central government pays monthly salaries in the form of a special education tax, local governments can attract city workers with no money. The cooperative members may work four days a week and do a side job on holidays. HiraI Taro Hirosaki, a professor at the University of Hirosaki, told Mainichi that "" the government and local governments with limited staff needed to save underdeveloped areas are all in a ' win-win ' situation. "" But "" With more and more cooperative workers now, the government is on the rise. ""In Japan, 797 (44.5 percent) out of 1,888 organizations are classified as an "" undersize, "" under national management. Underspend areas refer to regions with decreased vitality rapidly, such as falling production bases due to a decrease in population by 17 % or more during the 25 year period from 1980 to 2005. The program, which attracts young urban people to rural areas, is also being implemented in these areas."" In the city, my salary was more than twice what it is now, but I was able to work 15 hours a day, get out of shape and lose vitality in my life. "" Ithigawa (33) from Tokyo came down here as a partner and remained a civil servant three years later. "" For young people like me who live in a city, fat can be a good opportunity, "" he said. Local people are welcoming urban youth. They are seen as helping to revive the local economy. "" Ten forest workers in charge of cooperation with our local communities earn 250-300 million won per year, "" said an official of Sagawa Pavilion. "" Half of the 13,000 people (48 percent) are reliving their vigor in this town, "" said Sukimoto, a 77, a resident of the village. Mimasaki City in Okayama Prefecture turned a deserted house into a community center by transforming it into a café and community center. The multI-hundred-year-long town traditional dance festival was revived in the first time in 15 years.It is reported that six out of 10 cooperative members who went down to the provinces have settled down in the region after a three-year term. Among the 2230 collaborators who finished their tenure at the end of March, 1396 people (63 percent) have settled in the region, the Ministry of Government Administration and Welfare said. About half (53 %) of established collaborators have employed local businesses or businesses, and 26 % are engaged in forestry or agriculture. Some (9 percent) started their businesses with a subsidy of up to one million yen.On the other hand, some leave the area as soon as they finish their partnership. One ally who had worked in northeastern Japan said, It was stuffy because there were only three buses a day, adding, We looked forward to living in the countryside and failed to settle down. In some cases, local residents act as if they were sedentary or otherwise assigned important tasks. Tokumi OdagirI, a professor at the University of Tokumi-Maji told Mainichi that "" the task is to connect communities in an organic manner so that cooperative members can settle down. ""   To prepare for all these cases, Hyundai Motor Group will help you to introduce common car inspection tips that will keep you safe in the winter.< Data = Hyundai Automotive Group provided > ◇.1.Let the car wash after a snow drive was washed, the U.S. federal government issued an official recommendation regarding snow driving through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under the Transportation Ministry in 2015. In order to remove calcium chloride from snow driving, wash the floor of the vehicle and check the brake lines for corrosion. It is very suggestive that the government has made its own guidelines. That means it is directly related to the safety of drivers. According to AAA, each year, the cost of repairing cars damaged by calcium chloride caused by snow removal is estimated to be $ 6.5 billion (approximately 7 trillion won). If corrosion occurs on the frame that maintains the frame of the vehicle due to calcium chloride, durability falls dramatically and reduces the lifespan of the car, resulting in frequent accidents. Drivers in Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin, famous for snow in the United States, are said to keep a eye out and take good care of the car underneath.Korea is no country that can not do that. It is recommended that the car is maintained at the bottom of the car wash area or at an automatic car wash with the option of a lower car wash after eye driving. Warm times are recommended between 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m. as the water may freeze while washing the car. ▽ Data = Hyundai Motor Group provided > ◇ 2. Battery charge warning light warning light and you may have seen cars suffering from battery discharge. The reason why the battery becomes discharged frequently in winter is that it consumes more power due to the poor battery performance due to the cold weather and the use of electric heating features such as heaters.If you do not want to face a situation where you are confused because of a cold winter start, it is necessary to check the battery. To avoid discharging of the battery, the "" charging warning lamp "" is lit when the vehicle battery charger fails. The charging warning lamp is illuminated not only when the simple charging device fails, but also when the fan turning the fan inside the vehicle is broken. Therefore, you should check the warning lamp when it is lit. Of course, parking in a warm place when possible or keeping the battery cover covered with heat is helpful. < Data = Supplying Hyundai Motor Group > ◇.3. Cooling water cools the heat generated from an antifreeze inspection car engine so that the coolant does not freeze. Antifreezer should be added to keep the coolant from freezing during winter.At this time, there is a note to be noted. First, it must be filled with the same color of antifreeze that it contained in it. Second, if the antifreeze is discolored or contaminated, replace it with a filling. Antifreeze supplementation is as easy as anyone can do. Open the bonnet and fill the reserve tank with antifreeze solution to the marking line. It is advisable to have a ratio of water to antifreeze. < Data = Hyundai Automotive Group provided > ◇ 4. Tyre pressure checks are the most thorough checks to be made during the winter. In particular, it is essential to check the pressure. When the temperature falls, the air in the tire shrinks and becomes less pneumatic, which is likely to lead to not only driving but also to a major accident.It is very convenient to check the pressure status of the car in real time using the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) installed in the car nowadays. Because of the fact that the air pressure falls during winter, it is recommended to inject 10 percent more air.However, tires of four seasons are vulnerable to ice. It is advisable to have a winter tire, if possible. Winter tires show their true value from the moment the temperature falls below zero. Made of compound that is not stiff despite the cold weather, it does not slip and grip on the ice is excellent. Replacing the tire may seem cumbersome, but since it is essential for safe driving in the winter, it is advisable to check the tire condition regularly and replace it.No Jae-woong (ripbird@edaily.co.kr)"

"U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged North Korea to denuclearization at a Security Council meeting on the theme of nonproliferation and North Korea, but the North Korean ambassador to the United Nations has responded with North Korea's nuclear status as a given. The clash was only announced the day before when North Korea requested to attend a Security Council meeting as an unusually interested party. Tillerson, who first spoke, stepped back from his recent call for "" unconditional talks "" with the North, and stressed the need for continued stop of threatening behavior before dialogue with the North took place. But he said North Korea should return to the negotiating table, leaving the door still open and urging North Korea to change its attitude.U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson [AFP] said, "" We have not, or have not, given up any warning to the North that we intend to wage a war, "" and added, "" We have certainly refused to allow the Pyongyang regime to hold the world hostage. "" But the self-appointed ambassador, who was appointed after the first remarks by the 15-member Security Council, reaffirmed his de facto possession of nuclear weapons and flatly rejected calls for denuclearization of the United States and others. Now, the North is a responsible nuclear power and peaceful country, the ambassador insisted. North Korea has an absolutely perfect system to stop the illegal transfer of nuclear weapons and their technology, it said. This means that they will not appear on the negotiation table for denuclearization. Now the ambassador has turned around and put a firm face on his face while Tillerson was speaking, and North Korean officials who were in attendance eagerly wrote down Tillerson's words. In response, Secretary Tillerson said in an additional request, There is a country that `` breaks the Security Council resolution by firing an illegal nuclear device and launching an intercontinental ballistic missile. There is one country that is punished by the strongest sanctions. It is North Korea's ' Kim Jong-il ', it said. `` They are responsible for and should be held accountable for this tension. '' Vice Foreign Minister Cho Hyun-hyun, who attended the meeting as the chief negotiator, also acknowledged the North's regrettable remark, saying, As shown by the U.N. Security Council's resolution, `` The international community certainly sees North Korea as a country's nuclear power. ''U.S. Assistant Foreign Minister Cho Hyun and U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson (United New York AFP), Vice Foreign Minister Cho Seong-hyun (right) and U.S. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Rex Tillerson (left) who attended the U.S. Embassy in Washington Thursday. The meeting was held on the theme of nonproliferation and North Korea. Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, who presided over the meeting as the chair of the Security Council at ymarshal@yna.co.kr, also denounced the claim.At the meeting, North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, who is currently in charge of nuclear programs, agreed on the basis that the Korean Peninsula is in a crisis and communication channels are urgent. However, the United States and Japan insisted that more pressure be put on North Korea to get it to the table for dialogue, while China and Russia were extremely wary of the possibility of Washington being accompanied by a unilateral U.S. military presence. In particular, the U.S., Japan, and South Korea had ministerial or vice ministerial posts while China and Russia were present, and Japan's ambassadors were there to assess the distance in pressuring North Korea, which was led by Japan as the host country. Kono urged the international community to maximize pressure on North Korea in all possible ways. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Gutechs said, We need to immediately rebuild and strengthen communication channels with North Korea, including inter-Korean and military channels to reduce the risk of misunderstanding spreading into clashes. China said the growing tension on the Korean Peninsula is beyond our control, with Deputy Foreign Minister Yu Cha-en attending and with the related parties expanding their military training and armed protests. `` But the hope of peace has not completely died out, '' he stressed. `` The possibility of negotiation remains, and the option of using force is unacceptable. '' Russian ambassador to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenja, pointed to all sides of the peace exercise on the Korean Peninsula, saying, `` As long as North Korea feels a direct threat to its security, it is certain that it will never abandon its nuclear program. '' lkw777@yna.co.kr SpaceKs, an American aerospace developer led by Musk, set a new record. For the first time in history, space technology has launched a recycling rocket into space. Spacecraft recycling is essential to the commercialization of space travel, and the success of the launch means humans are one step closer to realizing space travel. The space shuttle's second-stage rocket Falcon 9 was launched at 10:30 a.m. (U.S. Eastern Time on July 16, 2008) at the Capernaberral Air Force Base in Florida with a space freighter. The rockets and space cargo ships were recalled and recycled in June 2017 and April 2015, respectively. The Falcon 9 rocket's first stage vehicle landed safely in landing zone 1 at an air force base in seven and a half minutes after takeoff. As a result, Space X successfully launched its 14th rocket this year. It is the fourth recycling-recovery rocket to launch. It is the second time that a recycling spacecraft has launched since last June. The launch was also NASA's 13th mission. Falcon 9, the first stage of the launch, and the first phase of its journey to land on base zone one in seven and a half minutes. It is the eighth time it has recovered. Jessica Jenson, NASA TV's Galmury Launch Director, said, "" Recycling will greatly reduce the cost of going into space, which is essential for future generations to explore. "" The launch was originally scheduled for July 12, but it was completed on July 15 after two delays due to the inspection of the land system and the discovery of dust particles. The space freighter Dragon carrying 2.2 tons of supplies is scheduled to arrive at the International Space Station on July 17. Supplies include Christmas gifts for astronauts, along with scientific experiments, daily necessities. Some scientific experiments have even been designed to measure how much energy the Sun sends to Earth, and how much waste space is being sent to Earth. The launch pad 40 used by Space-X was the site of the Falcon 9 rocket explosion during its pre-launch test on September 1, 2016. In other words, Space-X regained its status after a year and three months. SpaceSpace will launch another Falcon 9 within this year. The launch of the iridium satellite is scheduled for July 22. Space X has launched its first rocket (land) 20 times since it was first launched in December 2015. This is the eighth time that Korea has recalled land from Mars. The space rocket recovery was first successful in April 2016 after four failed attempts.

The bottom line was through the messenger chat room of customs officials. Earlier, data was frequently shared via instant messaging for what is known as a "" consensus gathering "" between officials at the Strategy and Finance Ministry and the Korea Customs Service. It was due to his fragile sense of security, which was not aware of the violation of regulations. The Office for Government Policy Coordination announced the results of the survey. According to the report, the head of the Office for Government Policy Coordination A collected the opinions of the Ministry of Finance and Economy's officials at 9:40 a.m., 20 minutes before the start of their meeting on December 13. The B officer sent an email to the same department C administrator who was in charge of the project, and C officer sent the data via Kakao Talk to the ministry's foreign exchange control department after taking a photo (Chapter 4). The Office for Government Policy Coordination explained, "" The photographs taken at this time are identical to those of materials that were leaked online. "" After that, Katok became a common channel. The D officer reported it to the director and the manager of the ministry directly, and also sent the data to the Korea Customs Service's Foreign Exchange Research Service, the director of the relevant agencies, via Kakak. E shared the data with the Foreign Exchange Investigation Department and the Dantock room. It was around 10:13 a.m. when the meeting had already begun.

Officer E also stated that although the data were not final, they were put in a single room for opinions. However, the customs agency's foreign exchange agency's foreign exchange bureau and Dantock Room (17) had three officials, including F, who were transferred to another department. Seeing this data, F's staff shared it with another single tock room he owned, the Telegram Dantock, which is a customs inspector (8 people), even though it was not his area of work. F claimed during the investigation that he did not think it was a security report because it was in the form of press releases and the timing of reports was "" distributed immediately. "" Ten minutes after F's residence was placed in the Dantock Room, G's in the same room at 10:30 a.m. were pumping out of the same single room to another one belonging to 12 people.

An officer took a picture and put it on Katok. Bitcoin's price went down to the 18 million won range at the start of the meeting. After increasing the decline, it dropped to 17.37 million won (depending on the exchange's business expenses) at 10:40 a.m. But at that point, the price has shifted to the floor. It was 10 minutes after news reports were delivered to civilian hands through the G General. In my case, I received the information at 11:16, said an official from the local money market. That means news releases were distributed via Kakak. However, the final press release was distributed via email at 2:36 p.m. The office said it has not been confirmed whether or not related officials intentionally leaked the materials to the private sector. It is intended to be "" the media coverage. "" However, they say punishment is necessary for cyber law violations. Since each ministry is in charge of demanding disciplinary measures against its employees, the ministry plans to go through further and more supplementary investigations before proceeding with the disciplinary measures, Min explained. Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon said Monday of the leak of news material that it is unacceptable, saying, We must make sure we reveal it so we can avoid taking off to the stage again. Experts say it is an example of how loose security consciousness among government employees affects the market. It is possible that only a few investors may have benefited from the undisclosed information. In fact, the price of Bitcone has fluctuated several times since 10:40 a.m. At 11:57 a.m. two pictures of news reports of an emergency meeting were posted on the encrypted currency online community, titled "" Results of an emergency meeting, believe it or not.

The listing of new cipher currency (registration of the Korea Exchange) will be postponed. The Korean Federation of Block Chaining Associations announced yesterday a joint statement on the voluntary regulation of the Korea Cryptosystem Exchange. The plan is designed to gather opinions from the industry and banks according to the recommendation of the government joint task force. The association's committee includes 14 local cipher strengths, including Bitsham, Coinwon and Corbit. According to the self-regulating measures, virtual accounts with enhanced self-checking will be introduced on January 1 next year. A system provided by the bank would allow the bank to deposit virtual accounts in the won only when the user information held by the exchange matches the information registered at the bank. If the two information is not consistent, you can not make an accommodation. In addition, they are limited to transactions with one person in their own name only. It also provides investor protection. The Cryptocode Exchange should separate and store and manage its own and customer assets. For this reason, the clients ' won-deposit amount should be deposited at financial institutions by 100 percent. In addition, more than 70 percent of the company`s cancer-causing waste should be kept in a cold storage purse with tightened security standards. Cold storage is an external storage device that is not connected to the Internet, which can reduce the likelihood of an attack from hackers. It also strengthens the requirements for exchange membership. Companies that operate cipher strengths in the currency exchange have stated that they have more than 2 billion won in capital. In addition, the ministry should provide an information security system that matches that of financial institutions and operate information protection personnel.

"▽ Bank staff is unable to collect the bank's deposits and withdraw the money from the bank due to the long weekend when they failed to find a suitable investment source due to low interest rates [Yonhap news agency] [Yonhap news agency] Kim Soo-hyun. The 10 long holidays are apparently due to the fact that economic players failed to find suitable investment sources at low interest rates. According to the Bank of Korea (BOK) on October 16, the demand deposit rate at bank accounts was 16.5 times. It is the lowest level since January 1987, when it was ranked at 163. The turnover of demand deposits is the payment of the deposit divided by the balance of the deposit. A lower turnover means that economic players tend to leave their deposits in the bank rather than withdraw money. The turnover rate of demand deposits has decreased since the global financial crisis in the late 2000s. In December 2010, he had 39.5 episodes to catch on to 40 episodes, but he drew a downward curve. The number of cases of December 2014 (31.3 times) did not go up by more than 30 last time, and fell to less than 20 in September last year (19.6 times). It slightly rose to 20.8 in March this year, but saw a sharp decline in October from 19.0 in August and 19.1 in September. The reason for the sharp decline in demand deposit turnover is long weekends. Due to the 10 days off in early October, the number of business days has decreased, a central bank official said. But it is also fundamentally due to the reluctance of economic players to invest or consume. They have live ammunition, which they can use at any time, but can not withdraw money easily because there is no place for households or businesses to invest. Kim Chun-koo, a senior researcher at the Hyundai Economic Research Institute, explained, It is because after the financial crisis, interest rates were lower and uncertainties grew, weakening consumer and investment sentiment among economic players. Even at low interest rates, a low rate of turnover of demand deposits at deposit banks can mean that the monetary policy will not work properly, raising concerns. In theory, a cut in interest rates would boost the economy by boosting consumption and investment instead of bank deposits, but that was not the case. If the money is not spinning properly, currency policy limitations will arise, Kim explained, explaining, It is not just Korea that is the general look of major countries.

The National Intelligence Service (NIS) confirmed yesterday that North Korea has recently transferred its evidence of involvement in the hacking of the virtual currency exchange, including the leaking of information by about 30,000 members during the Korea's largest virtual currency exchange. The seizure of virtual currency by Coinds last September was also included. The NIS confirmed that the malicious code used by Lazarus, the hacking group that has been suspected of being linked to North Korea, was the same as the malicious code used to hack the Korea Virtual and Monetary Exchange. The hacker group Lagerus, allegedly under the supervision of the U.S. General Services Agency, attacked the global financial system in 2014, including Sony Pictures Entertainment and Bangladesh Central Bank in February last year. Experts say North Korea is also behind Ransom Ware, which recently hit the globe. NIS has also sent out e-mails of job applications that hackers suspected of North Korea sent to employees of the Korea Virtual and Monetary Exchange, pretending to be beautiful professional women during hacking attacks on the exchange. If they open the attachment file, the computer or smartphone is infected, and through this method, they can try to hack into the exchange. Currently, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office is investigating the leakage of information on the members, and the police are investigating the theft of the virtual currency, including the Coin Is. We are referring to various investigation bodies in the process of reaching a conclusion, an official at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ` Office said. nari@yna.co.kr Ending a practice that since June 13 local elections May 9 in addition to replacing the local authority's presidential election and Moon Jae-in, who try to speed up your government for greater welfare, such as the reform drive.De facto interim assessment of the meaning.

In fact, it is not too much to say that the fate of the incumbent administration will depend on in the next six months. Park Geun-hye, the government after sinking of Sewol ferry disaster, 13 election is the school report card by the Seoul mayoral by-election defeat in local elections in 2014, progress and jijise was dented. The governing camp next year's local elections for president only allowed single five-year term in the so-called ‘The candle revolution’ through a revision of ‘the Constitution in 1987’ trying to complete. The opposition camp seems to agree on the necessity of constitutional amendment. However, the specifics of the reform, including the specialization of the constitution and decentralization of power, as well as the restructuring of the power structure, differ widely. Moreover, lawmakers tied to the restructuring of the electoral districts, free, Korea leader Hong Joon-pyo, both constitutional amendment vote in local elections made it clear that he opposes.

"The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has issued a "" No Now Impact on Korea "" policy on the U.S. national communications network, including public access to the Internet service provider YouTube, on Monday. Civic groups fear that the convenience of online consumers is being compromised. [AFP] Should it be installed by separating "" fast speed only "" from "" slow speed only "" on the highway? Or should all cars be able to run the same? The "" net neutrality "" principle, which was abolished in the U.S. on July 14 (local time), demonstrates a sharp conflict of interest between network operators and service providers. This is because the joy and sorrow between the companies and industries alike is sharply divided by the fact that governments maintain network-neutrality principles. Network neutrality means that network operators should not discriminate against network service providers. Communication experts often compare the principle of network neutrality to that of highways and other vehicles on them. Keeping to the principle of network neutrality would seem to enable the use of highways, such as portals, video clips, and other service providers, to service at the same speed and quality as vehicles. However, when the principle of network neutrality is repealed, as it is now possible for network operators who are comparable to highways to provide different types of highways, or highways, to be used by service providers. AtgeppI, Chairman of the FCC [AP = Joint News], who describes a decision to abolish the ' principles of network neutrality. ' [Information from Google · Netflix, and other large enterprises, is the most active opponents. Data-intensive services such as Netflix and Facebook may experience a significant slowdown in access. The network operator runs Fios, a streaming subsidiary similar to Netflix. If the theory is true, it is possible for them to block the traffic of rival companies that take up a lot of networks and then pay extra. Consumers who pay a monthly fee and use the Internet, as usual, could return to the "" use-based pricing system. "" Free, useable Google and Facebook may end up charging primarily for heavy users. The principle of network neutrality in the United States is a symbol of sharp political conflict. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which recently voted to abolish the principle of network neutrality, is the same as the Korea Communications Commission. After taking office after the launch of the Trump administration, FCC Chairman Ajit Phi is opposed to network neutrality. Pi is also a former network operator who benefits from eliminating network neutrality. It is natural that telecom operators provide telecommunications services in accordance with the principles of the capitalist market, he said, adding, The gains that service providers have earned by abolishing network neutrality will likely lead to investment in next-generation infrastructures. However, some point out that the abolition of network-neutrality is in turn just part of Trump's plan to erase Obama. How will the abolition of network neutrality in the U.S. affect Korea? Global IT companies such as Facebook and Google are likely to change service policies first in Korea. For high-traffic services like YouTube, you may have to pay extra or see ads installed by network operators, apart from Internet rates. Local businessmen like Naver and Daum are no exceptions. Korean Internet companies, such as the Internet portal in the wake of the abolition of U.S. network neutrality, said Cha Jae-pil, director of the Korean Internet Business Association, who explained that, "" If network neutrality is damaged, it will continue to be our main policy. "" Some predict that these IT companies will be left behind by network operators in competing for what they call the "" fourth industrial revolution "" of technologies, such as AI and autonomous vehicles. Local network operators, on the other hand, are reluctant to make any official points, but seem to be in favor of the U.S. decision. A carrier official said, "" As networks mature, they should be able to provide stable services to consumers, "" and predicted that "" when networks are reasonably shared, they will ultimately benefit. "" Meanwhile, the Korean government thinks the impact of the U.S. FCC's decision on Korea is not significant. We should see the decision as a change in the wake of the U.S. government changes rather than understanding the global trend, said Song Jae-seong, director of the ministry`s competition policy division. The Korea Communications Commission official, "" Moon Jae-in, the government's philosophy to maintain net neutrality principles have focused on big changes in government as well as in won't., said. The U.S. service, including YouTube, is also expected to remain in the Korean market because it uses Korean networks. However, since the abolition of the principle of network neutrality in the U.S. is a paradigm shift, it is believed that a big change will occur in many fields in the mid - to long-term. "" As network operators have gained the upper hand in the next generation Internet competition, they are more likely to be influenced by the semiconductor services and advertising market, "" said Professor Lee Kwang-hyung of KAIST's School of Future Strategy. Ha Seon-young, reporter of the Seoul Central News Agency, display.co.craft. [Facebook] [Central News Agency head] [Kakao Plus Friend] [Morbile web] [C.T.S.A. Prosecutors said Monday that they ordered the prosecution to investigate the corruption scandal involving former Seoul chief of staff to investigate the case again and assigned it to the prosecutor's office. The allegation is the origin of the latest investigation into Woo, which led to his summons five times and three requisitions. In August last year, iseokssu president at the time under the special inspector on the special investigation unit for further investigation and prosecution by the prosecution ▲ U 'platform', a former senior family firm funds for personal purposes, ▲.▲ suppliers and the preferential treatment his son's officers post ▲ Nexon Korea has under soil of Mars near Gangnam Station with suspicion, I looked into a land deal. After the scandal erupted, allegations of connivance with Choi Soon-sil and assisting with the corruption were added, and the case was handed over to the special prosecutor's team, Park Young-soo, and then transferred to the prosecution again due to limitations on the investigation period. After eight months of controversial investigations, including the dismissal of two arrest warrants, the prosecution indicted Woo without physical detention last April. The prosecution then applied eight charges, including unfair downgrades by officials at the Culture, Sports and Tourism Ministry and a breach of the Sewol investigation. However, regarding corruption cases, he judged that only his wife and his mother-in-law, Kim Jang-ja, and the chairman of the Samnam Development Chairman, were prosecuted and that Woo had no objections regarding insufficient evidence. Some raised criticism that it was a "" windward investigation "" or "" ill-tested investigation. ""Woo Byung-woo, former presidential secretary for civil affairs who was arrested on July 15. [Yonhap News Agency's speculative capital monitoring center denied the charges, and Seoul High Public Prosecutors ' Office decided to investigate the case.

As former senior prosecutor Woo is being arrested on July 15, the prosecution's re-investment is expected to accelerate. Prosecutors are expected to investigate the contents of the appeal and the results of the prosecution's investigation by calling in Woo personally, if necessary. Among the charges set out in Woo's arrest warrant were investigating former National Intelligence Service Commissioner Lee Seok-soo to cover up corruption. Therefore, depending on the investigation situation to be carried out after arrest, it is possible that new circumstances could be identified to support individual corruption suspicions. sncwook@yna.co.kr Gwangju Police said yesterday that they received 112 reports of "" neighbors ' dogs have owners "" at a country house in the city of Opo-eup at 11:18 a.m. Police and fire department found the dog running down the hill behind the country's country house in excitement and killed him at the same time around 11:40 a.m. The owner of the hospital, Choi (41) and his son (13) were taken to the hospital with their shoulders and legs bitten.

"▽ Seoul area is 1.7 times bigger than the French town of Fire in 1889. According to the Los Angeles Times (LAT) on July 15 (local time), the fire spread in Ventura, a northwestern town of Los Angeles, was carried by the nearby Ohai Valley, Montesito, and Santa Barbara by a nearby town of 10,000 acres. A house fire is on fire in the northwestern Los Angeles Tourist City, California. The Thomas forest fire, which started in Ventura on July 4, spread to Santa Barbara County in a strong wind. The forest fire was recorded as the fourth largest in California's history.It is 1.7 times larger than the total area of Seoul (605 square kilometers) and 350 times larger than Yeouido (2.9 square kilometers, inside the bank). About 90,000 residents were evacuated and 1,000 homes destroyed. There are about 20,000 partially burned down. There were two deaths including one firefighter. Most of the fires in Scoreball, Creek and Lilac, currently set off in western Los Angeles and northwestern San Diego, have evolved. Thomas Foreworm is still at 35 % evolution. Fire authorities in California are predicting that it will take three more weeks to extinguish the blaze completely. Weather officials forecast that the dry Santana winds will continue to blow and extremely dry weather will continue for more than 10 days with humidity less than 5 percent. If the Thomas forest fire continues to be affected by this trend, it is certain that the damage will surpass the 2003 Seda forest fire (273,000 acres), the largest disaster record in California. Seda Fire & Marine Insurance was the largest fire since 1932 when it began to assess the extent of damages from forest fires. The previous record also suggests that the unofficial record of the San Diego Canyon Fire Department in 1889 (with an area of 300,000 acres) could be exceeded. It would be the biggest brush fire in California in 126 years. The L.A.

North Korean hackers, therefore, have been hacking into the process of acquiring fake money by taking the user's account information and passwords. If virtual money is extracted via hacking, it can be exchanged with cash on the third world exchange, which lacks proper identification procedures, said an official of the security industry.◇ National Intelligence Service, which makes cyber mataharia and uses them for hacking, said North Korea recently sent out a resume and job application form to its employees, pretending to be a good-looking professional woman. Other times, they send a company acquisition, merger or acquisition (M&A) or offer.

After posting the profile of a pretty woman on Facebook, she made friends with a stock exchange official and talked to them via instant messenger. The victims testified to the NIS, "" The woman's tone was rather unnatural and demanded excessive company information. "" It is to make cyber matahari (a good-looking German spy during World War I) and use it for hacking.◇ 1700 professional hackers … With the world's best cyber attack capability, the National Intelligence Service and security company think North Korea's hacking ability is the best in the world. North Korea regards cyber attacks as a means to fight the three major wars along with nuclear and missile programs, according to the NIS. North Korean authorities and the military has more than 1700 hackers in at least six hacking organizations. It is estimated that 5,100 people in 17 organizations will support hacking. Many of them are used for cyber attacks whenever they have the opportunity to earn foreign currency, such as developing software abroad or running illegal gambling sites.The U.S. National Intelligence Service also called North Korea's hacking ability a "" threat equivalent to weapons of mass destruction, "" while Russia's security services chain Kaspersky Lab called the country's ability to infiltrate into the international financial system highly secure.  As sanctions on North Korea have become harder to earn in foreign currency, North Korea is mobilizing a group of hackers to take over virtual currency.The National Intelligence Service (NIS) announced on June 15 that "" We have leaked the membership information of more than 36,000 people in the rain fall of the nation's largest virtual currency exchange in June. We have recently obtained the virtual accounts of Japizon and Coins, North Korea Exchange's virtual currency. "" The virtual currency they took was 7.6 billion won, but it is worth 90 billion won. North Korean hackers demanded 6 billion won in rain in return for deleting stolen personal information, the NIS said.North Korea also attempted to launch a massive cyber attack on the local virtual currency exchange early last month, according to the NIS. The e-mail was mainly sent to the e-mails of 10 relevant figures of the exchange, and the e-mails contained malicious codes that were used to siphon off the passwords of exchange managers ' accounts and users ' virtual currency accounts. We have managed to avoid massive damage by urgently removing malicious codes infected with the KISA.The NIS analyzed the malware used for hacking, confirming that the malware was created in the same way that hacking groups Lagerus, formerly used for hacking Sony Pictures in the United States and the Bangladesh Central Bank, conducted. The U.S. FBI has called Lagerus a North Korea-controlled hacking group. The NIS also found in its e-mail trace that several North Korean Internet access addresses were used to send e-mails containing malicious codes. As North Korea is eager to break into not only the exchange but also its own virtual currency, individual users should pay extra attention to securing their computers and smartphones, KISA officials said.

"[The Seoul Shinmun] doctors were formulated policies of the government's Health Insurance Coverage ‘Moon Jae-in care’, the opposition. On July 10, 30,000 doctors (an estimated number of organizers and police) gathered in front of Daehanmun Gate, Jung-gu, Seoul, for the National Medical Center Competition. Considering that there are 130,000 doctors in the Korean Medical Association, the number is not small. Moon Jae-in care of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, was etched with signs of tension. Immediately, the door of the conversation was open, reaching for the doctors. Moon Jae-in care in health care costs, expand insurance coverage, helped by a doctor less often and consequently people why the association that blindly oppose government.?Doctors are inoperable heavy water storage, maintenance costs for ‘Moon Jae-in care’, Strengthening Health Insurance Coverage plan to deepen economic sphere as the system. The photo is of the drama, "" The romantic Doctor, Kim Sa, "" which is based on a professor of hospital at Aju University in Lee Kuk.● If you want to look closely at the problem, you need to understand the nation`s medical expenses system first. Medical expenses are divided into the "" salary "" care costs covered by health insurance and the "" non-paid "" medical care costs not covered. Pay medical care costs are priced according to the government's set "" number "" and receive it through health insurance. Doctors always claim that "" the cost of medical care is too low to pay even the cost of income. "" Moon Jae-in in earnest next year the government doctors this ‘water storage is the problem’ to put in care will worsen.The question of water storage is partly acknowledged by the government. In fact, Moon Jae-in Care into Health Insurance is people's coverage has focused on strengthening financial resources. Moon Jae-in, rally the next president aide at the meeting "" Moon Jae-in and senior Cheong Wa Dae on August 11 last that can well understand the concern is that of care for doctors.Work areas, said “medical is enough to listen to the medical profession's voice about number systems improvement” he said.Based on a study by the Korean Federation for National Health Protection and Emergency Response (emergency committee), which organized the rally, the committee argues that, "" We are suffering from an extremely low cost even today. "" Yonsei University's Education and Human Resources Development Cooperation Agency made a model of Ilsan Hospital under the National Health Insurance Corporation last year. According to the report, the cost coverage ratio of medical institutions based on the cost of medical care is 84.2 percent at upper hospitals, 75.2 percent at general hospitals, 66.6 percent at hospitals and 62.2 percent at clinics. Local hospitals such as Congressman OO say they can only get 622,000 won from health insurance when the medical expenses are one million won.By region, examination fee (50.5 %), entrance fee (46.4 %), injection fee (69.9 %), and purchase fee (72.7 %) were far below cost. Meanwhile, the inspection fee (153.6 %) and the video unit fee (141.6 %) were much higher than the cost. Examination and diagnostic imaging include a large premium without health insurance. Doctors say that since the medical bills for the sick and the sick are not enough, they are forced to make up for the insufficient income.Korean Medical Association's National Health and Guardian hosted by an ad-hoc committee for the past 10 days, Jung-gu, Seoul, Korea in Daehanmun Gate and Moon Jae-in care doctors in ‘The doctor a rally.’.Marching by chanting slogans against.Do Joon-seok, a reporter at the Korea Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, recently submitted data to Rep. The average cost of health insurance coverage by health insurance at medical institutions is 85 percent, which is 106 percent when non-pay is included. Basic care (75 %), surgery (76 %), and treatment (85 %) were below cost, while non-profitable areas such as specimen (159 %) and video (122 %) were found to be more expensive. Lee Pil-soo, head of the emergency committee, insisted that the only thing left to the medical community who has done their best is the stigma of a criminal who has maintained a non-pay-for-pay for economic gains. Lee Dong-wook, acting as acting director of the emergency committee, said, We are not opposed to strengthening health insurance coverage. As we have strengthened the capacity, we are asking for a fair price.● "" Hospitals make good money at 150 % cost, "" but some health care professionals have different reactions. Excluded from the reservoir because bubbles are a lot of gaman against Moon Jae-in, care that it is not right. Oh Geon-ho, co-operator of the welfare state, admitted that "" although we admit to a savings in payroll costs, we still have a substantial increase in the cost of care in hospitals due to the fact that the cost of non-payment costs is higher than the initial cost of care. "" If we expand the use of health insurance on non-paid premiums, we will see some of the income of health care institutions go down, but the bubble will eventually burst, he added. Kim Yoon, a professor at Seoul National University's School of Healthcare Management, also failed to calculate conscience-level cost savings from the cost structure of Ilsan Hospital, a major general hospital, saying, Some groups will quote materials that are advantageous to themselves.Moon Jae-in 30 trillion won to beauty and cosmetic care by 2022, except for the most excluded from visits to applying health insurance policy. The goal is to increase the coverage of health insurance coverage from 63.4 percent as of 2015 to 70.0 percent by 2022.The key is the ' preliminary payments '. For non-paid benefits, 10-70 % health insurance is applied to make the preliminary benefits, and further analysis is conducted to determine whether or not the benefits are paid. However, since the medical practice and treatment materials that were paid in advance in the process were covered by the national health insurance, the government has no choice but to check the price structure. There is no reasonable price for non-pay care because doctors voluntarily fix the price.The medical community believes the government is seeking to tighten control over the medical institution with a reserve wage. Lee pointed out that only 10 percent of health insurance coverage will control medical expenses and further reduce efficiency, when it is necessary to strengthen the prostheses to actually benefit patients. Some worry that the expansion of health insurance coverage will attract patients to larger hospitals, where medical bills will decrease. It is obvious that all health insurance policies will draw patients to larger hospitals when salaries should be ordered by urgency, he added, adding, then it would be hard to get admitted to a larger hospital.Professor Kim replied, "" I don't let any of the countries with social insurance set their prices on their own. "" "" Doctors say that the income is decreased, so they are actually repelling. "" Civic groups criticize doctors for setting the "" people "" before them, but in reality, they are "" fighting with their friends. "" Oh, the “because it is excluded from coverage of benefits is dated that Moon Jae-in, care, it is impossible to reverse the doctors know.” and "" this opportunity.Using suga impression that you will do the actual interest is the purpose "" claimed. The ministry also said it needs to show some degree of necessity for price hikes, so the outcome will be determined depending on how we have a tug-of-war. However, Lee responded to the argument by saying, If the system continues to be underpaid, the quality of medical care will degrade and therefore, we urge the government to make the right policy.● Annual premium rate of 3.2 % for 10 years should be maintained. "" Under such circumstances, the detonator is a "" premium increase. "" The ministry the past decade, Moon Jae-in care to maintain an average of 3.2 percent, making increases late implementation was possible, but the medical profession has a higher rate is inevitable.Position. The National Assembly Budget Office also predicted that the current health insurance balance would go into the red from 2019 to dry up 20 trillion won in health insurance reserves in 2026. However, next year's increase in premiums is 2.04 percent, less than the government's goal.The ruling and opposition parties even set aside 5.2 trillion won (9.8 percent of premiums) to cut next year's budget to support health insurance by 220 billion won from the government package. It is far short of the national treasury support standard of 7.5 trillion won (14.0 percent of projected insurance premium).The attitude of the people is also twofold. Moon Jae-in care for the approval rating was high payers who, for the eyes are cold. The Health Insurance Policy Institute of the National Health Insurance Corporation conducted a survey of 2,000 health insurance subscribers aged 20 to 69 in August and September, and found that 59.5 percent of insurance policy holders and recipients were in favor of expanding their health insurance coverage. People hoping to guarantee health insurance rate is much higher than average Moon Jae-in as care goal of the 70.0 75.9 percent. Critics say the government can maintain the system when people tend to increase insurance benefits while not paying more.We can endure with an accumulated amount of 20 trillion won for five years, but we will inevitably see an increase in insurance premiums later, said Oh, who decided to raise the figure to a level not even close to the planned for this year. Lee also said, I don`t know if we can safely implement the system without being able to secure funds as planned from the first year. Failure to address concerns about the financial uncertainty can only continue the standoff over the Moon Jae-in care. Moon Jae-in care of conservation and sustainability at stake here, all health care costs.The Korean Defense Commission and the Ministry of Health and Welfare announced on July 14 that they would start full-scale discussions after agreeing to form a working-level meeting. Because of Moon Jae-in care are likely to be delayed announcement, details early next year. Whether the two sides can achieve their cause of health insurance completion for the people is drawing attention.Jeong Hyeon-yong, reporter at junghy77@seoul.co.kr"
"Propose a voluntary corporate reform package by the end of the year. As the deadline approaches for the deadline approaches, Yonhap news agency, Fair Trade Commission Chairman Kim Sang-jo, has proposed a voluntary reform package for conglomerates by the end of the year. In particular, Chairman Kim appears to be nervous because the chaebol know best how to solve the problem and do not provide specific measures. "" I don't think I'd be satisfied with the revision of the shareholders ' agreement, but I'm not surprised that the orders weren't clear, "" said an official of a large company. "" If the government asks us to do something about them, what's our competence, it's our concern. ""According to the business community on June 15, Chairman Kim met with the four largest groups in June and five largest group executives in November, requesting voluntary reform and setting a deadline by the end of the year. In detail, we will conduct a thorough investigation into the foundations of large enterprises and examine the current status of the profit structure of holding companies. "" LG was the fastest response. LG Corp., the holding company of LG Group, acquired 24.7 percent of LG Corp. shares held by individual largest shareholders, including Chairman Koo Bon-moo, for 296.7 billion won to be incorporated into the holding company system. Many outside of the holding companies pointed out that they could make unfair profits for their owners ` families by providing work or work, and LG transferred the argument to LG as a subsidiary of the holding company. It is most relaxing to say, Thank you for the positive changes.Lotte Group reduced its circulation of 67 existing investment rings to 13 when it launched Lotte Holdings in October, and Lotte Chilsung Beverage and Lotte Food held the biggest share of Lotte Holdings at 0.66 percent and 0.64 percent respectively. SK Chemical also switched to the holding company system on July 1 when it was divided into SK Discovery, the holding company, and SK Chemical, the business company.Meanwhile, Samsung and Hyundai Motor, which have shown little interest in the move, are waiting to be disposed of.Samsung Group is focusing on stock-friendly policies, including share buyback incineration and increased dividends after Samsung Electronics officially gave up its conversion to its holding company last April. It is also worrisome that the company can not afford to make further changes to its corporate governance since its vice chairman, Lee Jae-yong, is being tried on charges of seeking a transfer of managerial control. The public service foundations, targeted by Chairman Kim Sang-jo, are also known to have shown little movement. The Samsung Culture Foundation has 4.68 percent of common shares in Samsung Life Insurance, 3.06 percent of common shares in Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance, and 2.18 percent and 1.05 percent of common shares in Samsung Life Insurance. The Samsung Life Insurance Foundation purchased 2 million shares last year when Samsung SDI sold 5 million shares in Samsung Corp. to break fresh circulation through mergers between Samsung Corp. and Jeil Industries. The group, then led by Chairman Kim Sang-jo, pointed out that the takeover of the group`s de facto holding company is self inflicted criticism as an expedient means to succeed. In response, Samsung said it has no comment.Hyundai Automotive Group is also known to have various discussions internally to break the cycle of investment that would lead to the Hyundai Mobis → Hyundai Motor → Kia Motors → Hyundai Mobis. However, he complained that it is difficult to make any big changes right away because astronomical funds are needed to solve the revolving investment structure. Hyundai Automotive Group's circular investment structure is estimated to be resolved at 6 trillion won when the controlling shareholders purchase the holding shares of Hyundai Mobis, the holding share of the parent company at the peak of the ownership structure. In addition, the scenario of dividing the major companies, such as Hyundai, Kia, and Hyundai Mobis, into the business and investment sectors and converting them into the holding company system is inevitable at several trillion won.As Kia Motors ` sale overseas became difficult during the foreign exchange crisis, Hyundai Motor should actually begin to acquire the car with its affiliates as the government demands, said an official at Hyundai Motor Company in a statement.Kim Chang-hoon, reporter of the Korea Daily News, ace@hankookilbo.com[geumji Do not illegally reproduce or redistribute Hankook Ilbo (hankookilbo.com),] < Anchors > exposure or abuse is increasing.

"Jeon Hyeon-seok : "" Studying for Women in the World Grand Prix "" was awarded to Park Chun-hee, the director of Songpa ward office in Busan, and "" 10 Years Old, "" and "" 10 Years Old, Chewable "" was a huge failure. She had to raise her daughter, an elementary school student, and her kindergartener son, but she could not get a job. Having lived as a stay-at-home mom, it was all she could do to live. When the restaurant opened a 13-square-square ㎡ (house) in front of Hongik University in Seoul that winter, spring would not come forever.Park Chun-hee and her hands have been busy cooking instant noodles and making tteokbokki, not gimbap. For a while, he went through the code and prepared legal documents. Now, he strokes the hands of citizens. Park Chun-hee, who has been transformed from a stay-at-home mom to a lawyer and the head of Songpa Gu in Seoul, isn't sure what to do with her two hands. `` I don't know how life will change again, but I can't wait, '' he said. In the small photo above, Park attended an oratorical contest at the Jangchung Gymnasium in Seoul in 1974. The upper right photo shows Park receiving the Grand Prize in New York last month as the winner of the International Women's Award for Innovation./ Fourteen years later, in 2002, forty-eight-eight-year-old journalist Oh Jong-chan and the Songpa district office, Park Chun-hee passed the bar exam as the oldest of her age at the time, as a lawyer. When he was 56 years old in 2010, he was elected as the head of Songpa ward in Seoul and re-elected in 2014. Park Chun-hee, 63, was awarded the Women's Award for Business at the Stevie Wonder Awards for Women in Business, New York, U.S., as the winner of this year's Oscars for Women's Innovation. Park is the first person to receive the award in Korea. Songpa district received a high score of "" Chamsal Haengto, "" a maternity center, and a safe toilet for the pregnant women, all of which supported the establishment of a underprivileged group. On July 29, he met Park, the head of the district office in Songpa-gu Office.What made you start as a chokeholder and then get re-elected as the district attorney? "" "" I don't know, "" I said, "" but when you were a charlatan, you're a lawyer or a district attorney. Songpa ward has many luxury apartments, but there are also many semi-basement rooms. Working as a district office, I met many small restaurant owners, young people who were thirty years old and spent money on tests, and people who had worked at the Han River several times for their families. Would anyone want to be? I can see Park Chun-hee from the past from their looks. So, you can feel it better. "" ChunhuI's house was located in the five day shopping center in Mundae-ri, Sinan-myeon, Sancheong-gun, Gyeongnam. He was renting a house. Chunhee was the third of five children. "" Many babies died soon after they were born, "" she said. There were quite a few birth certificates after the stones were passed, and so were my parents. So, the owner's bachelor called and named instead. My older sister's name is Ok-hee, and she turns into Hee-yi. "" Haven't you ever thought about changing her surname? "" I did. I asked the court to write down my name right after I passed the bar exam, and I was going to take a step out of the chun and change it to Jun-hee, who feels more neutral. The whole family was in a state of chaos. If you want to change your name, you can look it up at the naming center or something. Chun-hee says, "" Ten of the Nine, "" and I told you not to change it. So I went back to the courthouse and cancelled it. Then I decided to change the name to "" My father was a fish lover and a guy who loved to hang out with friends, and my mother made me jealous. "" I made buckwheat jelly by making scourings and went to the mountains to do some wood work. My older sister and I were busy studying, and I used to go to the store a lot. "" "" She was a real girl. "" She was nicknamed "" Sandolga "" when I was little. They've been milling around all day. When I watch the shop, I can see the children playing jegichagI, ball and rubber band. When I see it, I slide away. I played in the market, and I went to the mountains, and when I got out, I came home. Then my mother will kick me for it. But, I eat dinner bravely and go out again the next day. Ha ha ha! "" He laughed out loud several times during the conversation.She's been outgoing since she was a little girl. "" I usually played with a musma. She was a great baby. As he speaks well, he went to a national speaking competition when he was in junior high and high school and won an award. Local people said, ' Chun-hee is eloquent, well-studied, and intelligent, so be Park Soon-cheon, a leading female politician from 1898 to 1983. ' And I kept hearing that, and I wanted to go to law school, or politics and diplomacy, and say, "" By the way, I went to the clothing department at Pusan National University. "" I didn't do very well on my college entrance exam. I should go to a national university with cheap tuition, but I should not go to Seoul National University, because I went to high school in Busan, so I was going to Busan University to be filial to my parents. But I wanted to go to law school, and my teacher told me, "" You don't have your grades, and you should go to the clothing department. "" And he said, "" How was it going to college? It was cheap. I went out to law school, I attended medical school, I sat up all night discussing rice wine, and I gave speeches supporting the election for lawmakers. His nickname was "" Mr. Park, "" who said, "" I usually hang out with boys. "" She went to an administration school after she graduated from college and was into fun making money. She also worked at a party election office. Then, he loved and married. I expected to live as a normal housewife after having a daughter and a son, but I parted with my husband after 8 years of marriage.I moved to Seoul right after I did."" My parents said, ' I don't want to live in Busan anymore. Since your brother also lives in Seoul, let's go to Seoul together. ' Then I opened a snack bar. "" "" You went to grad school, and you were ready to start your own restaurant?"" One day he comes to a snack shop and watches me at work and he just cries. "" How did you raise Chunhee? I don't like the sight of her. "" I never felt ashamed. It was really exciting. "" Why?"" My business was great. I was enjoying making money. I had a flood of university students during lunch. I had a cook and an employee, but since I was busy, I was also cooking Ramen, making tteokbokki, carrying a tray and delivering it to you. "" Park Chun-hee, the president of Songpa ward office, served me last August at an event called Samgaetang. Park, who was once a snack bar owner, said, "" I am happy to cook someone hot. ""/ You could have made it as the owner of Songpa ward restaurant."" I quit the snack bar after a year or so. "" "" Didn't my business go through?"" It was a problem because the business was so good. I'm so interested in making money that I focus on the snack foods, and I don't have time to get a good look at them.My daughter, I started this business for my son. My parents took care of it, but back then, when I left my baby with my parents, I couldn't stop being very careful. "" So what did you do?"" Then, my ex in Busan called me on the phone. "" You seem busy, but I think I'd better raise them when they go to school. "" I'm thinking about it a lot. ' ' Yeah, I'd rather have my dad raise my children now. We can see it again later. "" It would have been hard to get the kids out of here."" I leave my two children at home, and my son is waving to me. "" Mom, come often!' I heard you say, When I got back to Seoul, I couldn't eat anything and lay down and cried for three days. Without the children, making money wouldn't mean anything. I just wanted to get out of this world. "" "" Ten previous years, "" I stayed inside the oldest one ever. Park then entered the Public Prosecutors ' Office in Sillim-dong, Seoul, at the age of 38, to study for the bar exam.Why was the bar exam all of a sudden?"" When I decided to live my life again, I wanted to test my ability. When I tried my best, I passed the bar exam, and decided I'd be honest with my kids, "" Did you ever study law at the age of 30 and get brave?"" Thanks to my brother, "" said Park In-je, former vice chairman of the Commission on Civil Rights. "" My brother at Seoul National University passed the bar examination first, even though he demonstrated and protested when I was in college. I took a second test soon after I left the army. All my family members said, "" That's okay with the bar exam. "" And I said, "" I'm my brother, too, and since I don't have any brains, why don't you pass in three years? "" And I yelled, "" You know, why don't you pass?"" Ha ha ha ha ha. I wouldn't have tried to say it would take so long at first. I spent all my money making a snack, and later on, my older sister, older brothers and sisters helped me out. I have also worked part-time at Sillim-dong Public Service Center and studied at night for the purpose of managing and consulting students. "" How could you study consistently over 10 years?"" Why did I have no conflict? Whenever I felt nervous, I would study to hear that I did my best when I saw people around me, when I saw them, and when I saw God I trusted. I sat and studied to get a hole in my hip. If you study like this, you will do better next year than this year, and you always said positively that someday you will be successful. """" There are exceptions, of course, but I don't think people should do their best."
