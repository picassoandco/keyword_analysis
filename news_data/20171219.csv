Gunsan Police in North Jeolla Province announced on July 19 that they booked a 40-year-old man without detention on charges of stealing. Yang is accused of stealing all four tires of "" Sorento, "" a 44-year-old woman, from an apartment parking lot in Sanbuk-dong, Gunsan at 2:20 a.m. on July 12. An investigation revealed that Yang committed the crime to replace his old Santape car tire. He used a pre-prepared tool to replace the stolen tire with one of his own. Police caught Yang, who fled through an analysis of a closed circuit (CC) TV. We tried to replace the tires because they were worn out, but the tires had the same size wheels installed in them, said Yang, as the tire replacement cost was paid. jaya@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)

Health authorities analyzed that three out of four newborns who died at Ewha Womans University's Mok-dong Hospital had been diagnosed with the infection, the cytrobacter furundii, which is a bacterial infection. News 1, December 19, 1717.12.19 Yoonseong News 1, was published from 6:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on July 19 when the cause of death of the burial burial at Jangji Hospital was closed down to news of infection and treatment error.He could not get a proper mortuary at all. Korea does not usually set up a separate mortuary at a baby's funeral. As a result, the dead person had to go to the lavatory immediately after passing through the hospital's AnchI Room and the National Institute of Scientific Investigation's autopsy on July 16.Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital announced yesterday that it will host the baby's first batch of babies who died from 6:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.The first delivery began around 6:25 a.m. when the baby was born (1 month and 1 week). She was the last infant to die at 10:31 p.m. on July 16 after CPR.At 8:05 a.m. the issue of B Hwana (9:32 p.m., the 16th, and the third death), which was only 24 days old, was followed. The bodies of the two newborns will be buried at Seoul Memorial Park and Cheonga Park in Gyeonggi-do, respectively.Around 10:25 a.m. the third delivery of the death of the baby was made after nine days of age (9:10 p.m., and the second death). Having visited the funeral parlor earlier, the father of the deceased sat down in the chair with a blank look on his face and kept standing.Soon after, with a firm expression on his face, he appeared with the body of a C exchange child in a silver box. After moving the box to a moving car waiting for the funeral, the father stared at the box as if he had never left to say goodbye. Eventually, following a hospital guide, she got into a moving car and burst into tears. After leaving the hospital, the body of the patient will be cremated at Incheon Family Park and buried at Cheonga Park in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province.At 1:00 p.m., the final announcement of the first death of the D exchange child will be made on July 16 at 6:04 p.m. The plane will go to Byeokje Central Memorial Park in Gyeonggi Province via Valmin.A new baby who died while being treated at a funeral parlor of Ewha's Mokdong Hospital in Seoul watches motor vehicles yesterday. Until the date of the execution of the reporter Yoon Sung-seong, the first of the news agency, the cause of death of newborns remained questioned. At least the first autopsy and a epidemiological investigation by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that the leads of suspicious deaths were all determined by doctors and doctors yesterday.The National Institute of Scientific Investigation found in its first autopsy report at 7:00 p.m. on July 18 that the cause of the patient's medical error was caused by overdosing fluid with evidence of gas in every newborn baby's cattle and intestines.The head of the Yang Kyung-moo Guksu Research Center said, "" If you take excessive doses of potassium chloride in the body, it is sometimes very fatal to the heart of the sap that is treated with intravenous nutrition. ""Health authorities, who have also surveyed the blood samples of infants who died of cancer, also raised their opinions that they could be deaths from bacterial infections. The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed yesterday that Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital secured samples of three dead patients who were undergoing blood culture tests and confirmed that they had developed an inflammatory seat with high fever.CherobacterplundI is an intestinal bacteria found in normal adults, but when the infant is not immune, it can cause inflammation and high fever in the affected areas. They are known to be infected with respiratory infections, surgical areas and urinary tract, and they are resistant to antibiotics. Other academic circles reported cases of healthcare-related infections through the hands of doctors.The KCDC previously checked blood culture records of three dying children to determine the possibility of bacterial infections in the group.Gram-negative bacteria, which are red when stained with special staining, include salmonella, mud fungus, typhoid bacillus, E. coli, and cholera bacteria.The national police, police and health authorities will investigate whether there were medical mistakes by calling in medical personnel who were in the intensive care unit of a newborn infant while conducting on-site reviews and pathological examination while maintaining a close cooperation system. The autopsy results for the national treasure trove are announced about a month later.Dongchoy 89 @."
"The head of the bureau conducted an autopsy yesterday. The results of the examination are not yet available. It's hard to tell with the naked eye. ' The CDC has a clue. Three of the four infants who died were found in the blood of three of them called the Setrobacter pyrundI. This blood test was done by the hospital after they showed some kind of strange symptoms before they died. Cherobacter pyrundI, what does that mean? Let me link you to Professor Lee Jae-gap of the Department of Infection Medicine at Kangnam Sungsim Hospital of Seoul National University. Hello, Professor Lee! Hi, Lee Jae Gab. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : Until yesterday, it was broadly referred to as "" Gram-negative bacteria. "" So, bacteria got named during the night, right? Mr Lee : That is correct. Usually, it takes about half an hour or so to get the name of the fungus. I think it's the result. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Seatrobacter pyrundI. It is strange. What kind of bacteria is this? Now, you can imagine that it's a coliform fungus that belongs to a colonorrhoea, so it's like a coliform cousin. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Coli's cousin, Lee Jae-gab > It is usually a very common germ that can be found in the colon and in the fecal material. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Really? So it's a fungus found in normal areas of our lives? It says that it can cause pollution in soil, water, and other places. There are also reports that pollution was caused. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > But can this bacteria kill you? It doesn't cause any problems if it's in the fecal material. You can get urinary tract infections, you can get peritonitis and when you have blood poisoning, you can turn into quite a dangerous fungus. So I think it was a problem because I had blood poisoning. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Then, healthy adults like us do not die immediately from this infection, but can these children be fatal because they were in intensive care? Now, this can be true, and in fact, if you have urinary tract infections, even in adults, you have fever and blood poisoning. But as children, I would suggest that the process went much faster. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I see. I pay attention to where this organism is detected. I mean, not latitude, not Zhang, not Eshoo. I just had a blood test and it says that my blood has bacteria on it. Professor, isn't it true that when you have this virus in your blood, it's not the same infection that we think it is -- the infection you're getting with your mouth or your nose? From blood, you're septic. Most of the procedures that lead to septicemia can be followed when germs invade into the blood. This causes parallax and deterioration over time because each child is in different states. But the four babies that died this time got hurt almost simultaneously. Almost simultaneously, it's a testament to the highly invasive form of septicemia. In this case, you can say that it's most likely that bacteria have invaded your blood by something in common, and that's what Kim Hyun-jung is about. So, we have a common infection, like the mouth, the nose, and so on, if the bacteria are infected, the symptoms of this disease are different for each child, different for each person, and if they die, it should be different. These children died multiple times at the same time, and what they have in common is that they had that virus in their blood. So isn't it possible to question whether this is really the very kind of fluids that got into the blood? A feeling of silence prevails in an intensive care unit of newborns at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital in Yangcheon-gu, Seoul, Thursday. The Yangcheon-gu Police Station said Monday that four infants who were being treated at an incubator at Mok-dong Hospital in Ewha Womans University died one after another after receiving emergency treatment. In fact, there have been quite a few reports of deaths both in and out of the home and in neonatal intensive care units from septic infecation. So, in the case of a paper, there are 12 reports that are made around the world. It would be very important to determine the path of contamination. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Each newborn was infected by accident in a different route, but it is possible that they died within 81 minutes of being infected ... Do you think it is very rare?It is not likely to occur in large numbers simultaneously as a result of a common infection. And the dead children were in the same sector in the neonatal intensive care unit. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung was a child in the same area with the same name, so it is very possible that they were exposed by some common infection. ◇ What do you mean, you were exposed to it by Kim Hyun-jung > Common Infection? ◆ I jae gap > geureonikka eotkkeona I suaek doe oyeom it eo ... ... Even in foreign countries today, there are cases where the sap is contaminated and causes blood poisoning. There are also cases of contamination during the course of the infusion preparation. There were even some cases when pharmaceutical companies became contaminated and made sap. But it's very likely that some of the fluid supply was part of the problem, and therefore the contaminated fluid was given and that the children were in serious form septic. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Whether it was contaminated during the manufacturing process or during the administration, the sap would have been contaminated and placed in a bundle with children. And you see the possibility of multiple deaths at the same time. So you're suspicious of a sap contamination accident after all? ◆ I > gap > Yes, it is. There were many similar cases reported in other countries. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > But this is an intensive care unit, a neonatal intensive care unit. How can the fluids in the intensive care unit become contaminated? Now, one of the infections that we're most concerned about in the intensive care unit is catheter related infections. Because the intensive care unit patients are in bad shape. So, when you have to go straight into the central venous tube, you keep a tube in the blood vessel. And that's why so many of these blood flow infections are occurring intermittently. Catherers are placed for critical care, and during the manipulation of the catheter, germs can inevitably accumulate.◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > But what is catheter?Now, this is a catheter, and it holds a tube inside the blood vessel to supply sap or these things. Newborn babies are treated for blood vessels near the heart, especially since the veins in the arms or legs are underdeveloped. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : I always put it on, for the children...., and when I enter the intensive care unit, I put it in. But since the catheter is in the blood vessel, and the sap is being fed into it, there are quite a few reports of bacterial infections during the course of the infusion. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > intensive care unit is supposed to be operated like an aseptic room.◆ I gap > > But since the intensive care unit is the place where the children are in bad shape, there are more resistant bacteria than are found in the general ward or in the outside community. You can say that you're much more likely to be exposed to germs. No matter how good you are at managing intensive care units, you can be vulnerable. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > You mean that the weak part could be intensive care unit. There are many resistant bacteria. So what we're finding is also endomycosis? It appears to have been confirmed as a resistant bacterium. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I see. Now, as I'm talking about this, I'm starting to get more concerned about it because it was a sap accident, it was an infection caused by a sap contamination accident, and I'm concerned about other kids. The kids you were with. There were 12 others, weren't there? There were 12 children who were transferred to other hospitals, 16 in all. Among them, fluid therapy -- they say there were five children who had intravenous feeding. Four of them died. So even with the mechanical connections, it's quite possible that there was a sap accident. The other one is being told that he is in good condition. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I mean, there are five children who received sap after plugging in the injection pipe. Four out of five people are dead and one is in good condition ... Right. So, do you think the rest of the children, who weren't plugged in the infusion tubes, weren't likely infected with bacteria? Mr Lee : It is unlikely that it will be. And I know that one person who had a catheter plugged in was tested first. I understand you're waiting for the results. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I see. I'm really worried. Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon has ordered an all-out investigation into the nation's infant intensive care unit. What should you focus on? There is a place, once, to make intravenous feeding fluids. And there is a preparation facility that is in the form of sterilization, and all gloves are worn and protective gear are required. You must check the processing facility. Then when the sap is placed in the ICU, the fluid treatment room, the pharmacy that makes the sap, Joe,"
"So there is a place to make medicine, and there is a space to give it to the child and take it with you. I think we should also look at these areas to see if they are free from contamination or problems. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Professor, I heard from now on that even though intensive care unit is under strict management, it is a good place to have germs. The testimony now says that he touched the syringe with his hands with diapers, too. These are the testimony. You can't do this, can you?One of the reasons why it is so important to emphasize hand washing at medical institutions is that the bacteria in the fecal matter can, or can contaminate a catheter. That's why you keep emphasizing hand washing.◇ Kim Hyun-jung > If it didn't work like the one who did it, it would be a deadly story that wouldn't happen. And then there are, of course, accidents like this that happen in many countries and actually in developed countries. So, the hospitals are working hard and nervous to keep a tight eye on patients to manage these areas. It's a shame this is happening. ◇ Professor Kim Hyeon-jung > ` Gangnam Seongsim Hospital ` has five children now. Kids who have been transferred from the year before. As we were getting closer to the hospital, many of them were turned on to us. Are the children ok? ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Will listen to this message. Professor Lee, thank you. I was Professor Lee Jae-gap of Sungshim Hospital Infection Internal Medicine Department, Kangnam. Our team interviewed all eight of the parents who watched their children closely. Jung Hae Sung is the reporter who met his parents face-to-face.Jung, I understand that most of your parents don't interview other media companies. How did you meet them?[Reporter] Our first tip-off was at 11:00 p.m. Saturday, shortly after the children were all killed.The reporter could go straight to the scene and see their parents, and you can see that they were filming.Despite not being actively interviewed at first, parents were outraged at the hospital briefing, which stated that "" the dead children were at their worst. ""And then my parents called me in person to meet me in person. Let's hear what he had to say then.[Child Dad : I don't want to show any resentment towards babies born as fathers, and if they were originally sick, I would accept certain deaths. But the fact that the children who weren't sick died in a moment, in a moment, wasn't it so easy to die?[Anchor] We ran this for a few minutes in the front page, and they told us they were in the most important condition, but before that point, they were allowed to leave the hospital. It's a different story, the hospital's position, I guess, you know, you just got ta get more angry. I heard that your parents gave you a detailed account of the accident.[reporter] Okay, that's right. This is a drawing of a children's father, a middle aged one room layout.There are 12 incubators here. Other layout shows two middle aged children, all four of whom died in Chung-hwan's first room.Especially in the middle of one room. In the case of two rooms, no children were killed.If you look at the [anchor] layout, you might think something's wrong with the first room. What do the 4 children who died in particular have in common?[Reporters] Three of the four newborns who died were questioned because they were suspected of having a bacterial infection, and the only child on the left was three. If you look at the picture, the upper left of the room is not examined yet.And all three of them testified that they had an incubator open when they visited at lunch on the day they died. Let's hear some testimony from then.[Child : From the time I visited him at lunch on Saturday, I was thinking, well, why did I open all the holes in my incubator?] But he's running hot. The nurse says that the exchange room is a little hot, or that it's been fed like this, so it's not a big deal. [Anchor] That's the first time I heard that this was happening, and the incubator was opened. Parents don't understand now that the incubator was supposed to block the effect from the outside.The other similarity is that all three of the children had bottle feeding.The day before she died, two children, and on the fifteenth, and one child, instead of a tube, began to breastfeed. [Anchor] Of course, this is not the way to say everything for certain. It's just an assumption, but the location of the children was first assembled. You know, the incubator had a lot in common, and they were fed with baby bottles.[Reporters] So, one thing that parents had in common. Anchors : Didn't the parents know the incubator was open on Saturday? If Saturday's lunch was right, did parents who visited the children then notice that their bodies were in a strange condition?[reporter : Yeah, it's a child's heart rate that's going up dramatically. Her mother told her nurse on two occasions that her heart rate was too high, and the nurse said both times, "" It's a transitory "".Anchor : You said it was over 200 times a minute?[reporter] Yeah, it is. The doctor later came, but he sent her away because the visiting time was until 1:00. Let's hear her say.[Child : I think you're hesitant, and time's up, and you'll come anyway for dinner. You can then listen to the explanation. But when I asked if I shouldn't come and see her, I asked her to leave.] She was very nervous, but she turned her back and explained her child's condition to no one.[Anchor] Did the parents finally hear from the child only after he was in danger?[reporter] Okay, that's right. One father said a doctor called the children at about 5:20 p.m. the night they died and told them they were in danger. Let's hear what Dad has to say.[Child : I asked him urgently then. The baby is in trouble. But the resident said, "" I'm still the most angry. It is a routine event for premature babies. They call these events events.[Anchor] Well, for parents, there may be a part of it that doctors don't understand. They're calling it an event. Maybe it's a very sad situation. But what other doubts have you raised?[NEEDS] That's it. In today's autopsy, my parents wrote down some information about sanitation and gave me a lift to Katok. This is a group chat room with my parents.And one of the things that was really shocking about that was the testimony : "" I have a baby in my arms the day of death and I have something like a fly in my room.They found fly flies where infection control was supposed to be the most thorough.If the parents were to blame, the sterilization management of the intermediate room would have been wrong.[Anchor] I guess so. However, I don't think it's a season that could have been seasonal, but I think it would have been very careless to the extent that it was a fly.Jung.haesung @ bc.co. kr. .s live to YouTube and tips to the news room! ▶ Story, Live, Bisends by JTBC Social Story Copyright http://jtbc.joins.com"
"As of last year, 15 trillion won more employees will have to go abroad than last year's minimum wage. At the scene, five members of a family, including the president of the company, Mr. and Mrs. Park, and their two sons and daughter-in-law, were working together to pack and deliver paper. The company's annual sales are around 4 billion won. Park said, "" I am now keeping the factory as tight as I can get by wrapping plastic packs, and all I could think about was the fact that next year's minimum wage would only give me the benefit of the government's employees, and I would hire them all. "" The company is also considering reducing the number of its employees to 29, which is currently 35. That way, they can get the government's minimum wage support next year. As a minimum wage measure, the government will provide funds worth 2.97 trillion won to small businesses and small businesses with fewer than 30 employees.◇ Review of closing of factories next year ¡ ° In an emergency survey for small business owners, more than half (62.2 %) of respondents answered, ¡ ° There is no additional small business plan for next year ¡ ± According to the Korean Federation of Small and Medium Business, the total additional cost of labor for businesses will cost them 15.2458 trillion won as a result of the wage increase next year. Currently, around 40 percent of small and mid-sized Korean firms can not afford to pay interest on their operating profit, and they have no choice but to trim their staff to prepare for the minimum wage hikes.An employee touches a production machine at a small and medium-sized manufacturing company, T, in Chungju, North Chungcheong Province, yesterday. As the minimum wage increase is decided, the company plans to reduce the number of new employees this year, buy and operate automation facilities in Japan starting next year. Shin Hyun-jong, head of a local subsidiary of S Metal Company in Incheon, said, We can not endure the current wage hikes and are considering closing the factory. The company, with 25 employees, now spends around 80 million won a month on labor. Starting next year, monthly labor costs will increase by 10 million won. We have brought the company on a deficit of around 100 million won for the third year, but now we can see the limit, Shin said, adding, It is hard to tolerate any further minimum wage hikes.There is even a chain of bankruptcy crisis in small manufacturing areas such as casting, welding, molds, heat treatment and surface treatment, said an official at small and midsize businesses. In the manufacturing sector, often referred to as the root industry, more than 26,000 small and mid-sized manufacturers employ 500,000 people.If the employment of small and mid-sized companies is shaken, the overall employment environment in Korea could worsen. 87 % (13.11 million employees, OECD members below) of the nation's total employees work for small businesses (less than 250 employees). The proportion of small and medium businesses in Korea is much higher than other major countries (41.33 %), Japan (52.8 %), Britain (53.08 %) and France (63.3 %). The nation is the most vulnerable to minimum wage fluctuations.◇ Small Business Research Institute for Industrial Factory Movement researcher Roh Min-seon said, Worrying the worsening employment conditions, such as a steep rise in minimum wage and shorter working hours, will play a major role in boosting domestic employment. As large Korean companies moved their manufacturing bases to China and Southeast Asian countries since the early 2000s, small and mid-sized companies have become more hostile to Korea. In fact, according to the Korea Export-Export Bank, domestic small businesses invested $ 5.6 billion to $ 2.55 billion (approximately 6.12 trillion won) in the first nine months of this year, up 20 percent from the same period last year. The current trend is expected to surpass last year's all-time record of $ 6.17 billion per year. The number of overseas subsidiaries also rose 8.4 percent from the same period last year to 1379. In other words, small and mid-sized companies with sufficient funds are moving their factories abroad to find cheap labor, and the smaller ones are staying in Korea and are struggling to reduce their workforce.A representative of small and mid-sized enterprises said to a government official, "" If I told you that I heard the minimum wage was to close down, I wouldn't have to say I wasn't going to make more money.

"The fifth generation portrait of a renowned American artist was purchased at an auction held in the U.S. by Gang Se-hwang and verified on May 19 when he first visited the American Foundation for Fine Cultural Heritage in Korea. Panbusa is the term for Panjungchusa Temple, which refers to the one-of-business office of Jungchungbu, where high-ranking officials who were not submitted to a specific office during the Joseon Dynasty are located. Jong-un is the grandmother of Gang No-Cheong (1883-1808), a tattoo artist during the late Joseon Dynasty. It means portrait painted in September when I was 71 years old. Jinju Kang's founder, Kangmintung of Goryeo Dynasty. [Photo Cultural Heritage Administration] Deputy Director Kim immediately sensed that it was an object. Gangno is the great-grandson of the late Joseon Dynasty painter Pyoam (1713-1771) Kang Sehwang (1713-1771) who represented the Joseon Dynasty. As four generations of portraits of the Gang's family have been handed down with the exception of Pyo Am, a five-generation family portrait of Kangno will be completed. Kanghyeon Foundation for Cultural Properties, located outside of the country, has held three internal assessment committees. Then in late October, he flew to Everard's Auction and Control Center in West Georgia, U.S. The portrait of Kang was confirmed at the auction site, and was sold for $ 310,000 (approximately 340 million won). Jo Seon-mi, an honorary professor at Sungkyunkwan University, said, "" I have vivid memories of the day, "" as a portrait expert who participated in the field inspection. The confirmation of the five portraits of a single family is unprecedented in the world. It is the first time in Korea. It was like watching a five-part drama. The portrait of Gang Se-hwang, a Joseon Munhwangdong painter who is famous for being the teacher of Kim Hong - do, was opened at the National Museum of Korea in Seoul yesterday. It is with a portrait of his four ancestors at the National Museum of Korea. A portrait of a literary family representing the Joseon Dynasty and a family figure spanning two centuries were introduced to the public at once. The name of the Gang Se - hwang and Gang is Jinju Gang Eul-Gong (殷 公 派). Kang Min-chung (963-1021), a public figure who was a contributor during King Hyeonjong of Goryeo Dynasty, is the founder of the museum and a portrait of Gang Min-chung (Treasure No.588) is also housed by the National Museum of Korea. When you add together the photo of Gang Min-chung, a six-generation portrait is a collection of portraits of people. Gang-in portrait, the son of Gang Se - hwang. [Photo Cultural Heritage Administration] The Gang Se - hwang family is famous for being the teacher of Kim Hong - do. After grandfather Kang Baek-nyeon (1603 - 1681) and father Kang-hyeon (165-1733), Gi-gyeong Hall of Art and Yeong-dong (two years old and older) were honored with a tattoo. Kangno, who served on the Korean Coast Guard and on the left, later joined the book, including this, the "" Four centuries of feudal lord. "" Kangio portrait, the grandson of Gang Se - hwang. [Photo Cultural Heritage Administration] This portrait is very important in art history. Portraits of Gangio (1788-1979), the grandsons of Ganghyeon, Gang Se-hwang and Kangsehwang, are all designated as treasure No.589, 590 and 1458, respectively. Portraits of Kangin son of Gang Se-hwang (1729-1771) were submitted to Seoul Auction-Promption and bought at 350 million won at the National Museum of Korea. This year alone, the family tree of the four and five portraits were identified. Portraits are one of the representative genres of Joseon Dynasty art. The king or king's face was painted with spots and wrinkles, and the inner parts of the person were revealed. It is called by the telegraph operator as a way of expressing expertise. The portrait of Kang Noh also depicts the skin, beard, mummy marks, and praying mantises of a 71 year old man as precision, and shows the scholar's stubborn style well. While the four traditional portraits were painted on silk, Kang-in's portraits were made of thin paper. Professor Cho Seon-mi said, "" It is not nearly as good as Kang Se-hwang's portrait, which is considered to be a masterpiece of Joseon Dynasty, but the portrait of Kang is not yet a painting technique. "" It is not known exactly how he went to America. It has been confirmed that a person living in the city of Seobana bought something that the Catholic Church had donated and kept.

Mok-dong, Yangcheon-gu, Seoul ‘day of a pregnant woman’, which was installed in a hospital that tells you a citation president.The banner is being knocked down to the 18th. Yonhap news - Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital Medical Center's death toll on the medical community is 19 days old. It is the fastest time to determine whether a local medical laboratory is in serious trouble. The middle age of the drug analysis unit and the drug analysis unit in Seoul National University of Seoul's Mok-dong Hospital is dying in turn Police are reportedly planning to investigate whether to manage the incubator, infection control conditions in the neonatal intensive care unit, the exact dosage when administered medication, and the route of administration as soon as possible. Police said, "" Since the machines have been preserved almost completely closed to the public, it is okay to investigate the possibility of mechanical defects, but the source of the infection and the infectious agents have disappeared. "" Police are also speeding up their reasoning of who should be summoned for questioning. Police officials say six doctors and five nurses are under investigation, but they could add more, calling in anyone, including doctors already investigated by the Yangcheon-gu police. Police are also analyzing medical charts that they received from hospitals. Police and experts are paying attention to the possibility of problems in injection therapy, as it is confirmed that three out of four infants who died were infected with the same bacteria. The National Institute of Scientific Investigation said all four infants were treated with total venous nutrition. Full venous nutrition is a method of giving different nutrients by injection, depending on the state of the infant. An intensive care unit official at a university hospital said, "" If you have problems with the amount of sap that is falsely controlled or get infected during the injection process, it can cause a serious situation immediately. "" "" It is hard to convince the medical profession's common sense that the four infants ' deaths at the same time were caused by infections, "" said Yang Kyung-moo, head of the Seoul Bun-soo Research Center.Police also said that hospital abuse of antibiotics may have affected infant deaths due to blood culture tests conducted by three newborns with suspected resistance to antibiotics. Separately, Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital will organize an investigation team of outside figures to investigate the causes of the infant deaths. Five specialists from each field will participate, headed by Professor of infectious medicine at Seodae University of Seoul, Kim Nam-jung.

"■ ○ Senior-level service and labor shortage = Autoya Holdings, a home chain that offers more than doubled the number of employees during the past year. Businesses are closing their doors for fear of losing their jobs after too many of their existing employees suffered from excessive work. In particular, the "" employee support "" phenomenon is spreading in the service sector, where the shortage of human resources is excessive. According to Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the local home chain Autoya Holdings plans to double its stores at its stores on July 31 and January 1 next year. Among the 150 directly managed stores, 80 out of the total 150 outlets are targeted except those at shopping centers. Due to the decision, one out of four Korean businesses will be closed for two days. Otoya is a mid-sized restaurant that operates 441 restaurants worldwide, including 348 in Korea and 93 abroad as of the end of March this year. Considering that many of the Autoya branches follow the 365-day, 24-day policy schedule, the decision is quite radical. GenichI Kuboda, president of Motoya Kuboda, explained the purpose of the policy, saying, Excessive sales will reduce efficiency, and I will give priority to relaxing and improving the way I work. Japan's main lodging chain, the Tokyo Trunk Hotel, also decided to stop business for four days starting July 30. Yoshitaka Nojiri, president of the Tokyo Trunk Hotel, explained, It is good to take a rest and work hard starting Jan. 3. Ten-alide, the owner of the tavern, will close 120 stores nationwide on July 31 for the first time in the company. Food companies Monterosa and Royal Holdings also plan to introduce regular holidays to ease the labor shortage. Earlier this year, the Royal Hosts, a family restaurant that closed its doors 24 hours a day in January, and a cowboy family, a steak restaurant, decided to close three times a year.More and more businesses are charging no cash to save their employees. Japan boasts a reputation as a ' cash giant ', accounting for 80 % of its payments, but its employees are complaining about the high cost of cash payment and its delegation from Tokyo to increase the effectiveness of its cash placement. Food companies are suffering from a shortage of human resources due to the lack of holidays and the frequent nature of working late hours. Improved employment and more jobs are the first in these higher-business-intensive and labor-intensive industries to see workforce drain. According to the short-term employment index released by the Bank of Japan on July 18, accommodation and restaurants ranked last with a score of - 62 this year. The index means that the lower the number, the more labor shortage. The transportation, mail and construction industries also had an index of 40 each, which shows a serious manpower shortage. It shows that the entire service sector, which is hard to replace machines, faces a severe manpower shortage. As the shortage of human resources reaches a critical level, the movement to hold onto talented people with a strong effort to protect them is spreading, according to Nippon Gaizai. Even the IT industry is busy trying to soothe young employees who dream of relocating. The same applies to the mobile communication industry, where the turnover of new employees is 40 percent. NTT DoCoMo, the nation's No.1 mobile carrier, called on employees at 2,400 branches to take a day off between January 31 and January 3 next year. KDDI, the second-largest mobile carrier, also sent a policy to 2,500 stores nationwide to set off days or more during the same period. Softbank, the third-largest company, will be closed in March 2018.Now, check out the stock market in the Seoul economy and all of the short and fast redistribution-wide household parts! People in their 20s, unmarried, and single households tend to eat instant noodles on weekdays for dinner, according to a report.According to the report on the market status of instant noodles in 2017 released by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and the Korea Food Distribution Corporation on July 19, the market size of cup noodles (if it is a container) grew at a rate of 174.8 billion won (724.8 million won) compared to the total retail sales in 2016. During the same period, the size of the Korean instant noodle market (KRW 1.4363 trillion in 2017) grew only 5.4 percent. As a result, the portion of cup noodles in the overall ramen market increased from 30.5 percent in 2012 to 33.5 percent in 2016.Teenagers are eating cup noodles. The reason why the cup cup cup market is growing so big is because the growing household size and the tendency to seek simplicity are attracting the attention of containers that are easy to consume, the ministry said. Recently, sales of Bibim-myeon and jjajangmyeon have also increased significantly. Over the past five years, the ratio of Bibim-myeon to jjajangmyeon has risen by 55.3 percent and 34.4 percent. The total instant noodle market in 2016 amounted to 2.1613 trillion won, an estimated 12.1 percent rise from 2012. The ministry also analyzed that the rise in prices of premium ramen products, which are more expensive than traditional instant noodles, is one of the reasons why the market is expanded. Korean instant noodles are exported to the U.S. for 2016 at $ 290 to $ 315.9 million, which is close to 300 million. It is a 40.8 percent growth from the $ 226.3 million in 2012. The major exporting countries of Korean instant noodles are China (25.9 percent), the U.S. (12.3 percent), Japan (6.6 percent), Taiwan (5.6 percent), and Australia (4.4 percent).Korean consumers buy instant noodles the most at discount stores (25.0 percent) and convenience stores (21.8 percent). One characteristic of the market is that the proportion of instant noodles purchased at convenience stores has increased recently. In 2012, the percentage of instant noodles at convenience stores was 16.9 percent.Research on instant noodles showed that the most frequently eaten instant noodles was ' weekdays and holiday lunches ', followed by weekday dinners (14.9 %) and weeknights (11.5 %). 17.2 percent of people in their 20s said they often eat instant noodles for weekday dinners, compared to other age groups. Other age groups saw a 10-150 percent increase in their teens, 12.8 percent in their 30s and 14-13.9 percent in their 40s. Among single people, 16.5 percent said they eat instant noodles on weekdays, and 12.1 percent said they were married. In the case of single-person households, 20.8 percent of households ate instant noodles on weekdays. This figure is much higher than the 2-person households (12.4 percent), the 3-person households (13.4 percent) and the 4-person households (148 percent). The survey on the number of times people eat instant noodles found that 42.6 % answered ' once or twice a week ', and 17.4 % answered ' once or twice a week ' (21.4 %). The answer to "" eating more than three to four times a week "" was higher in men (28.0 %) and in single household (34.6 %).Yoon Hee-il, Senior Correspondent, yhi@kyunghyang.com> ▽ Culture Minister Park Young-soo and special prosecutors ' team, including former Culture Minister Kim Hyeon-seop, requested former Culture Minister Kim Yoon-choon at the court. The special prosecution team decided to hold former chairman Kim and former minister Cho for seven years on charges of obstructing the authority of the former chairman on charges of abusing his authority in the court Thursday. All are the same sentences as at trial on the first trial. The special prosecution team indicted former presidential secretary for education and culture Kim Sang-ryul, former presidential secretary for political affairs Shin Dong-cheol, former secretary for political affairs Kim Jong-duk, and former presidential secretary for education and culture Kim So-young. They are also equivalent to the single-seam structure. The first trial results were slightly different from the prosecution's. Kim was suspended for three years on charges of neglecting his official duty, while Cho was sentenced to two years in jail on charges of lying in the National Assembly. Former Minister Cho, who was under indictment for being involved in the probe, was released. It is noteworthy whether former Minister Cho will face new evidence on the blacklist in the course of the appeal trial, thus influencing the judgment. Cho Yoon-seon, former Culture, Sports and Tourism Minister, is in Seoul's Central District Court's decision hearing Thursday morning. Former Chief Presidential Secretary for Political Affairs Park Joon-woo, 64, of the 2017.12.19 photocdj@newsis.com did not hand over to Cho on July 28 the task of handing over the previous evidence on the culture blacklist. The court also sentenced former senior and new secretaries to one-and-a-half years, former minister Kim Jong-duk, former vice minister Chung, and former secretary Kim to two and a half years in jail. Kim and others were sent to trial on charges of having allowed the so-called blacklist to run, which prevents subsidies from being given to culture artists or related groups who are critical of the government or who have different opinions. The harm that the nation and the people have done over their wrongdoings is too significant, the team said during the first trial in July.afero@newsis.com>"
"As KT is also expected to revamp its data plan to reduce its rates by 2.2 million won a month, SKT is eager to reduce its universal fee system in the run-up to the 24-hour roaming rate launch.The government and the Communication Policy Council, which will participate in the project, will hold a meeting on July 22 to discuss the introduction of a universal rate system. The fee is expected to be set at 20,000 won per month, 200 minutes of voice, and 1 GB of data. The data processing cost is three times higher than the lowest data driven fare system operated by the agency, with over 10,000 won cheaper than the data driven fee system. The three companies have so far opposed the plan, saying, "" It will cause huge losses to the service providers and the regulation against market logic, "" but it is highly likely that it will become reality due to the strong will of the government.Therefore, communication companies are taking the initiative in cutting rates themselves. The first tape was broken by LG U-Plus, the smallest subscriber. LG U-Plus will stop signing up for the new ' Data Special D ' at 110,000 won per month and drastically extend the benefits of the ' Data Special C ' (88,000 won) pricing plan at the bottom. In fact, the fare for the new 11 million-won system was cut to 88,000 won, or 22,000 won.SK Telecom also introduced a 24-hour roaming charge system on July 15. As the roaming charges were based on 24 hours per day, subscribers were required to pay the price of the last day regardless of arrival and departure time. KT is also in the process of drastically revising the benefits and rates of its data-centric pricing system, which is scheduled to be announced in early January next year. Until now, Itong-sar has operated a rate system that gives similar benefits and rates to those of other companies except by name. The National Assembly and consumer groups have filed several accusations of collusion, but the agency called it a discretion to do business. The same was true of the 24-hour roaming charges.However, things have changed since the government has set up a drive to cut down communications costs with the Universal Rate System. That is because the payment force is stronger than any security for reductions in communications costs. The plan requires SK Telecom to introduce a ministry-level plan, which the ministry says is mandatory. The agency believes the fallout from the introduction of the Universal Rate System will affect the overall service price.Therefore, it is understood that the agency is trying to appeal to public opinion by lowering the preemptive rate and reduce the justification for the government's universal rate system. It can also be pointed out that the fourth quarter's performance was affected by the increase in the discount rate from 20 percent to 25 percent. Iton-sab saw an effect of decreasing its accounting sales by 5 percent as a result of a discount rate increase. The universal rate system is a policy that can deal a huge blow to the company`s performance, said an official at the telecommunications industry.Ahn Ha-neul, journalist of Seoul News.com, ahn708@asiae.co.krRecently, foreign media including Britain Daily Mail quoted Chinese media as saying that he wrote the story of a nearby man from Kaiyuan, Liaoning Province, who is building the plane himself.Joo's dream of working as a welder and a motorcycle repairman is to have his own plane. The problem is, his favorite plane is the Airbus A320, a mid-sized airliner, which is virtually impossible for a welder who has over 100 billion won in stock.However, Joo did not give up on his dream. Because he made an air bus with his friends, using his special abilities. He decided to build the Airbus A320 in the same size as it really was based on information on the Internet. He started to build the gas, which is 35 meters long and 37 meters long, directly from the factory site near his house. Last October, his plane was built by air, which was surprisingly easy to see. The steel maker spent 800,000 yuan (130 million won) out of 40 tons of iron.`` My Airbus, of course, could not fly but my dream has become a reality, '' Joo said. `` I studied a lot of time and raised money to build one. '' We will finally finish the construction by May next year, he said with a smile. 　Park Jong-ik, reporter of the Seoul Welfare Committee pji@seoul.co.kr ▽ Survey on the actual condition of hospitals nationwide : dahora83@newsis.com Minister Park made the remark at a parliamentary briefing on her pending issue. `` Yes, in a comprehensive sense, I do, '' he said, responding to a question from the fisherman's councilman Ozese Durbull about the incident. We believe there is a possibility of medical error or infection, said Jeong Eun-kyung, director of the KCDC. The controversy over a late response from the ministry and the vaginal fund explained, I saw it as a medical accident rather than an infection. When Rep. Yoon So-ha of the ruling Democratic Party pointed out the hospital's initial response, it appears they did not realize the possibility of an epidemic but perceived it as accidental. He said, ' Currently, hospitals are not obliged to report even if there is a chain death. We agree with the comment, which says, ' We need to step up reporting obligations. ' Rather than being impressed by the short death of four people, we saw them as medical accidents and took action at the scene, Jeong said, I did not ask the health center to investigate the infectious diseases because I could not suspect an infection. We decided it was necessary for us to recognize the situation and avoid infections, adding, The police investigation into the medical accident took priority. We will prepare a system to monitor the infection cases in the neonatal unit, Jeong said. Meanwhile, a nationwide hospital investigation is expected to be announced as early as July 28. We agree on the possibility of an early disclosure of the alternatives, as it is important to investigate and to answer questions about the scientific investigation, but to settle the anxiety, I agree on the possibility of an official announcement with the government officials. The interim announcement, he explained, Once we complete a fact-finding mission by the end of this month and announce plans to remove the causes, we will do so together. We plan to complete a nationwide check on the safety management of the neonatal intensive care unit by July 28 through local health centers, Chung said. ironn108@newsis.com>"
"CBS Radio's Kim Hyun-jung's Newscast Still Lost in a Month 3. Police have turned to public investigations since the 15th. According to her statement, Jun-hee went missing about a month ago, so November 18. But he didn't report it to the police until three weeks later, when he didn't think he'd taken it. Police are running a search now, but there is no sign of it. Where on earth did the 5-year-old disappear? We had a hard time contacting Miss Jun-hee's family on CBS. Let's connect them. North Jeolla CBS correspondent Kim Min-seong, is it on? This is Kim Min-seong, a reporter from CBS, and Kim Min-sung. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I need to check the search situation until yesterday. Is anything going on? Kim Min-seong : The search is still in a stalemate. Police searched the area around the house where she disappeared and the nearby hills and searched the underwater reservoir with underwater cameras from yesterday. We have found Jun-hee, breaking ice that is about 5cm thick on the surface of the reservoir, but we still haven't made any progress. Especially when we have secured CCTVs in residential areas and black boxes of cars that are expected to be the most important clues, we can not see anything of Jun-hee. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung is simply missing. Even though a search was made, breaking the ice in the reservoir, no traces remained on the CCTV. And she's telling me it was November 18 when she reported it, and it was 20 days before she reported it. Well, when you put the various circumstances together, you don't feel like you're missing? As such, there are criticism that it is questionable whether it is a violent crime or not, as Kim Min-seong > anchor said. Police say it's not entirely possible, but they don't think anyone is guilty. In short, I don't rule out all possibilities, but I approach them from various angles. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > All possibilities are open. But it turns out, even the person we call our stepmother is not yet legally a mother. Yes, it is Kim Min-seong > Now, anyone who is reported to be the mother of Miss Jun-hee is not an actual mother or stepmother, but rather a housemate or lover of her biological father. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > So, is it Joon-hee's father's roommate? ♫ Kim Min-seong > Yes. After many ups and downs, my mother sent Jun-hee to my father. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > I was staying with my stepmother. What else is it that she is saying, ' I thought Jun-hee took you home? ' Don't you two live together? Also, Kim Min-seong > his father and stepmother are not living together. Are you separated from the other two? Mr Kim : Yes, it is. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > This complicated situation is underlying it. In this situation, did reporter Kim Min-seong have a hard time contacting Jun-hee's paternal grandparents, her paternal grandmother, and her grandfather? Yes, it is Kim Min-seong > Jun-hee's paternal grandmother and paternal grandfather were the first children who were known to have developmental disabilities but were actually very intelligent. He even memorized his father's cell phone number. And here's what you said. Let's listen to the interview first. [Recording : You're My paternal grandfather.] "" How intelligent and charming. When I get home from work, I make a lot of fun of myself. Bring anything young, and you're good with errands to run, and you can't miss it. "" "" You can say that. "" "" You can say that. Very clever. So I memorize my father's phone number clearly. "" ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Now depending on the information my stepmother gave the police have development problems and autism. Did you say anything like this to your grandparents who told you something else? Did you check? Kim Min-seong > Jun-hee covered the childcare facilities that had been around for several months before she disappeared. Jun-hee said, "" I didn't have any problem communicating as much as I thought. She also answered questions about her physical condition. Jun-hee is five years old this year, so she is six years old, and she has never opened her door since then, and she has been like any other kid. The police were aware of this. Let's hear what a police officer said. [Recording : Police Department] [Intelligent intelligence] I can be questioned as if that's the case, but I can communicate. Either understand Hangul or English. "" ◇ Selections are being divided on this part. She was smart enough to read Korean and speak English, but when she said she was a developmental disorder, she said she was immature and told her autism to be like she was a lost path, and this is ridiculous. Mr Kim : Yes, it is. Finally, as Jun-hee suffers from developmental difficulties, she can not be determined as a simple disappearance, such as going astray and getting lost. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. Anyway, it was her grandmother, who is known to have been with her when she disappeared for the last time, and she refused to investigate the lie detector. Mr Kim Min-seong : New maternal grandmother refused to investigate the lie detector, complaining of psychological unrest. Especially after April, her stepmother told her that she needed treatment in Seoul, and that she would stop going to the childcare center. So, from mid-August to date, anyone who knows Jun-hee's actions has been taking care of her is her stepmother, her stepmom grandmother, and her biological father, and has never been known since. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. So, did you try touching the stepmother, stepmom, and stepmom? Kim Min-seong > I have been going to my grandmother's house since the morning before yesterday. No one was left in the house, and when the detectives knocked on the door, no one came out. We almost never used more electricity than other homes. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > is very complicated. In a very complicated situation, even reporting missing persons is getting so late, I have to tell you the truth now that I have a lot of bad thoughts about where she is. Police are investigating all possibilities. I hope you find Jun-hee soon. It's a very stuffy situation. Kim Min-seong : Jun-hee's paternal grandmother and her grandfather, who spoke on the phone to us, also complained of being frustrated and asked us to pay more attention to them. Let's hear the voice for ourselves. [Recording : "" I can't say anything right now. Let's wait for it to go well. "" [Recording : [Ko Joon-hee's paternal grandmother] I can't even say. I can't even speak. How can you say it all? I was only on TV Please find out where our Jun-hee is. If you see anything, please contact me and ask for it. "" ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Grandmother's sober voice rings. I hope you find Jun-hee soon. Kim Min-seong, I want you to cover the story thoroughly. Please contact me as soon as new information appears. Mr Kim I first met Kim Hyun-jung, a reporter from Jeonbuk CBS, and Kim Min-sung. How do you think we can solve this missing case? How would you describe him? We have a link to Professor Lee Soo-jung of Criminal Psychology at KyunggI University. Professor Lee, are you with me? How are you? ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > You heard that the situation of this disappearance is very complicated. ^ Lee Soo-jung > Family relationship is a little complicated. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > right? Isn't it strange that it's so hard to find traces? ◆ Yi Soo-jung : There are many cases in which even dead bodies are usually recovered from the common abuse cases. Now my stepmother told me that she wasn't responsible, and I'm sure she didn't take care of the baby anyway. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. If the stepmother had made such a violent assault with her stepmom, and if the neighbors had such a statement, someone would find it difficult to say anything about it. I don't think we should leave the possibility open for now. What kind of accident did Kim Hyeon-jung, an expert, have confused? ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Then, what part of the situation do you pay attention to? Lee Soo-jung : At first, I had to question the role of my stepmother because in April, I ordered my children to leave their home and took it to my stepmother. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. As your biological mother, your mother, you become a new grandmother. However, it seems that it is difficult to see any problems during the process, so no further statements are being confirmed now. So if I had to report immediately when my baby was missing, I would still be less suspicious, but the problem was I reported missing three weeks later because I was three days late. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Didn't that make a final dent in the situation? It's too late to report the disappearance. ^ Lee Soo-jung > Yes. Find out anyway if you go missing in 24 hours."
"It is time to step down from here, but as it has been nearly 20 days since they went missing, the first possibility deliberately delayed, and delayed, the report. There is a possibility because of abuse, but the second possibility is that he or she would have been so routinely let go, and now she's out of the house and back again, which would have caused delays. And we can't rule that out now. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I understand. There are also theories that her stepmother intentionally reported her missing on purpose, but she was raised as if she had been left alone in the first place, not as professor. If you thought you would go to your dad when you leave home, and your dad would go to your mom, but if you were left here and raised a child while thinking you were doing this, would it have been too late to report you? ^ Lee Soo-jung > might be so. My new grandmother was the lead manager. But when she is not her paternal grandmother, she ends up being her stepmom, I don't really know how much time she is responsible for her child's upbringing. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : What is more important is now not a new grandmother. The law says that the stepmother and Jun-hee have nothing to do with it. You are taking it to someone who is not involved. So I'm a little bit curious about how much control he ended up with. And the problem is, I think he realizes to this child what kind of administrative responsibility the stepmother had, the stepmother. And the truth is, when they reported an undiagnosed child missing, they would have lost their autism and reported it like this. So, in such a case, the stepmother was aware of the fact that she had to take care of her. But, if you look at the characteristics of a young child, you can see that he or she is intelligent enough to know his or her cell number. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : That's what mothers say. If only the children could communicate with each other in a more difficult way than the children would have otherwise been hurt and lost, So, there are still many possibilities now. Now it is possible that it would seem like a slightly different possibility than taking the time to make an effort to get a confession from this mother, for example, that she would have left her home alone during the day and went missing as a third party entirely. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. Therefore, although the stepmother was clearly guilty of neglecting her missings, it is complicated to make her a suspect. You have to keep all your options open. ^ Lee Soo-jung > Yes. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Please, Joon-hee is a month old now, but I will be watching with Professor Lee Soo-jung, hoping that it will be miraculously. Thank you for this receipt ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Thank you. Go Joon-hee, who went missing from Jeonju. Now police are investigating the allegations that they have released all of their photos and descriptions. I'm five years old. She is 110 cm tall with short permed hair and an oval face. She had two eyelids, but she had strabismus I'll have to find them together. I even met Lee Soo-jung, professor of criminal psychology at KyunggI University. [Kim Hyun-jung's Newsshaw Program's Home Right-Close] Copyright (www.nocutnews.co.kr) Yoon Bong-gil [Doyo-dong Daily], who visited Joseon's home office on July 19, was Kayo-dong Hiyo-mi, who invaded Tokyo. A moat, or 30m high, around the wall of Osaka Castle. It is almost like an alcortrase prison, isolated by artillery, and a military division commander near the front and back. It was here that Yun Bong-gil (1916-1932) spent the last month of his life in jail. In November and December 1932, aerial photos and actual measurements of the prison's prison in Osaka, Japan's army, where Yoon was imprisoned were recently discovered. The location of the Osaka prison was approximately known, but pictures of it were first obtained. Measurement maps showing the location and area of the inside buildings of the jail will also be unveiled for the first time. December 19 marked the 85th anniversary of his death in Kanazawa, Japan.　A prison surrounded by ▼ Moats … Military headquarters in front, and a photo of a garrison "" Last Month "" by an ▼ (military police unit behind), and an observation deck at an army garrison headquarters in Osaka (middle building) located just before an observation deck. What did the doctor think as he looked down Osaka Castle wall, which looks like a huge cliff, as if it were being provided by Osaka Central Library? The cells in which Yun was imprisoned were built by Toyotomi HideyoshI on the streets of Shikaku and Jigeun. The entrance was blocked off by only one, one wall, one wall in the east and the south, and high walls in the north and west. The Osaka Army garrison, where Yoon was imprisoned, was a stark red brick area. Kim Kwang-man, producer of the documentary film production company The Channel, revealed yesterday that he had taken aerial photographs of Japan's Osaka Army prison and an actual survey made in 1931 at the Osaka City Hall and Nakashima Library in Japan. The actual map was prepared one year before Yoon died for his country, reflecting the circumstances of his death.○ Osaka Prison, surrounded by the wall and moat, has been drastically maintained as a park in the precincts of Osaka Castle, with all military facilities including those in jail being dismantled. However, when Japan launched a full-scale invasion of the continent in the 1930s, the Japanese Army's 4th Infantry Division was in the area. According to the actual map, a four-tier command building was built near Denshkaku, and a prison with 10 buildings in the southeast corner, facing the outside moat, was located. It is difficult to locate the cells in which Yoon was imprisoned because the names of the buildings are not indicated on the actual drawings. However, given the structure of the Japanese prison in the U.S. military base in Yongsan, Seoul, Yoon's cell was probably located in a rectangular building in the middle of the site. The Yongsan military jail has also set up a central cell with support facilities such as a ward and a restaurant outside its compound, Kim explained. Yoon was arrested on April 29, 1932 and sentenced to death by military police in Shanghai on May 25, 1932 after bombing Japanese military leaders at Hongkou Park in Shanghai. Japan sent Dr.Dong to Osaka on Nov. 18 for fear of provoking Korea`s independence movement by publicly executing him. Yoon was kept in solitary confinement at an Osaka prison, and was shot dead shortly after being transferred to Kanazawa, the headquarters of the Japanese Army's 9th Infantry Division. Kanazawa is believed to have executed the death penalty in Osaka, where many Koreans lived, as there were leaflets protesting the execution of Yun. The loss of Genkichi Ueda, commander of the army's 9th division, based in Kanazawa, is also believed to have affected the loss of his left leg, according to Yoon.○ The transfer and execution of Yun was carried out in secret, according to a secret report by the Japanese Army Ministry of the Republic of Korea, Manmil University. Upon arriving at Kobe, Japan on November 18, 1932, Yoon was taken to Osaka Prison, surrounded by 10 military police officers, and blocked access by reporters. After spending a month in solitary confinement, he left Osaka Station at 6:25 a.m. on December 18, 1932 and got off at Morimoto Station at 4:35 p.m. The Japanese military police, concerned that the place of execution would be known to the outside world, stepped down after passing through a terminal that was higher than its original destination, Kanazawa. Yoon, who was imprisoned at a detention center of the 9th Infantry Division in Kanazawa, spent 13 hours sleeping before he died. At 6:30 a.m. the following day, he left the detention center with three military police officers and two guards and arrived at the jail at 7:15 a.m. Shortly before execution, the Japanese military prosecutor asked if he had a will, after the court ordered the death penalty for murder, attempted murder, injury, and explosives. In response, Yoon responded, I have nothing to say at this time, as I have already prepared to die. The report noted that he was calm and smiled a little, answering clearly in Japanese. At 7:27 a.m., an order was issued to the doctor who was bound to a mold, and 13 minutes later, doctors confirmed his death. He was only 24.Kim Sang-un, reporter sukim@donga.com ▶ Official Facebook of The Donga Ilbo alone / Donga Ilbo"
"A nurse asked for the signatures of about 10 pages of consent on October 28. Kim Ki-hoon, a reporter at the Seoul Yonhap news agency, said, "" Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital wanted to utilize various medical data, including medicines, for research purposes. The bereaved family of a newborn requested that the consent be checked with the hospital for possible clinical trials with newborns. Bereaved A met with reporters at the funeral of Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital in Seoul on Oct. 19 and asked for a written consent from the nurses while having a baby at 1:00 a.m. on Oct. 28. A said, "" The consent form asked the guardian's consent for the use of the data used in treating premature babies for research purposes. "" He then said, "" I asked the hospital to give me all the data to see if they were related to the clinical trials. "" And he said, "" I've given you a lot of data in the course of treating the child. "" As for the allegation that the hospital requested infant parents to approve a clinical trial on breast-feeding effects, I heard nothing about the clinical tests, only saying that breast milk is good in hospitals. However, he requested several times to the hospital to check the documents, but complained bitterly, saying, "" I can't communicate with the hospital. "" Meanwhile, the funeral parlor of Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital held a memorial service for the dead babies one by one.

It means the space of schools, right here, is a violation of human rights, sexual harassment, discrimination in appearance. It is called the 190-page book and I met Jung Jin-ah, who prepared the book for a year by phone. Hello. Hello Jeong Jin Ah ◇ Jung Kwan-yong : Are you a student or did you graduate? I graduated from Jung Jin Ah > ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > When did you graduate? I graduated this February. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > But you started preparing this book about a year ago? ^ Jung Jin-ah > It's been about a year now since I prepared it. ◇ Government service > How did it start? The human rights violation cases in our school have become the talk of the town in Jeongjia > SNS, and if they are collected and published in a book, such things can be prevented from recurring. And I made a pamphlet out of the belief that it would help me be alert. ◇ When did human rights violations start on the government service > social networking sites? Jeong Jin Ah > From February of this year ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > February, this year. How many cases have you increased? Jungjina > There are approximately 270 reports. ◇ Government use > Really? After these tips were posted on social networking sites, did the education authorities or any of these things do? ◆ Jeong Jin-ah > The education office called and thanked us for the school, and the three teachers were acquitted after the investigation and the two were warned. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > Did the education office say that three people should be investigated and two should be disciplined by the school? ^ Jung Jin-ah > ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > But were you cleared of all requests for the investigation? ^ Jung Jin-ah > ◇ Government use > and discipline at school is just a warning? ^ Jung Jin-ah > It ended there. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > How did the students react when they saw the results? Although violence was quite public, we were disappointed in the disposition of the victims. Because the school said, "" We're going to do something right, "" because it said. But we can't help it, so we're going to work hard to make a book and tell them about it, and that's what happened. ◇ Government use > What are some cases? Jungjina > among many things, talk to the student like ` I will hit you with this broom ` if you do not answer the question with the broom on your face. She unties clothes saying that English words are similar to pronunciation when she teaches English words. I was talking about this, talking about having molested, talking to these students, and I was talking about, "" That's why you did it. "" You'd come in and you'd touch them on the head, and you'd be on your own, and you'd be on your own with them. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > Jung Jin-ah, have you ever had such an intrusion? In the case of the school's human rights abuse collection, don't call me as a victim of violence. Thank you for keeping quiet. Thank you. Or I was told that a false rumor that I went to a motel with my boyfriend wouldn't drive you out of school for defamation. And that's how he talked. I told that to a student who was a victim of violence at school. ^ Jung Jin-ah > And yet, you could be the perpetrator. And that's how he talked. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > How many students are making this book together? In total, 11 people are producing. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > I don't think your school would be pleased to know that you are making this book. ^ Jung Jin-ah > When I first told them about production, they said, "" The disciplinary measures will be taken, so don't make or distribute the books. "" ◇ Information that you are aware of punishment will discipline the teachers involved in the information that you have violated human rights. ^ Jung Jin-ah > And I will take corrective action. I will prepare systematic procedures. She said, "" Your classmates say that it hasn't really changed that much. ◇ Government service > ` Don't you want me to read a book `? ^ Jung Jin-ah > Actually, I haven't been able to distribute the book yet because my teacher told me that I can't allow it to be distributed even when I made it and took it to school. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong : Is this book complete? ^ Jung Jin-ah > The leaflet is finished. ◇ Government use > But has it not been distributed yet? What should I do if anyone who listens to this program wants to read this book? If you search ` Open Katok ` on our social networking site, there is a chat room that can be purchased by us. We can guide you through the process, but since we're a student, we don't make as many copies, so we only want to produce as much as we can get an order. ◇ Government use > OpenCartock room literature > Here? ♫ Jungjin > Yes. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > What did you feel when you prepared this for one year? There were many people who were afraid to give information. So every time we hear about it, we realize that this is really an environment where the victim is unprotected and otherwise unimpairable, so we're more responsible for this book. However, when I hear that they support me, I think it would make an institutional device come up fast. I've also heard a lot from other notices or private papers. And when I heard that they were doing wonderful things and cheering, I felt that violent things were happening not only in our school, but they were also happening frequently. Jeong Kwan-yong : So, I think this book is even more necessary, so I should suggest through this book that human rights violations and violations of students ' rights are a social problem not only at the schools but at all. What do you think? ^ Jung Jin-ah > ◇ Government service > Thank you for your efforts. Thank you. Thank you very much. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > Jung Jin-ah.

As I open the window, a fresh morning air filled the air. Most cars are turned into electric cars or hybrids, and due to the eco-friendly system applied to buildings, pollution emissions have decreased dramatically. I shut the window right away, feeling chilly. The ferrobeskite solar cells installed on the exterior walls of the house provide energy, and the Future House, which combines high-efficiency insulation, eco-friendly materials, and Internet technology, can restore proper temperature. Breakfast is solved with milk and chicken managed by the fresh vegetables and food sterilizing system grown in the Smart Farm. I left home. There is no need to stop for a car and no traffic jam on the way to work. It is due to the connection of autonomous vehicles with the traffic management system as part of the Smart City project. The first thing they did after work was to check the condition of their patients last night with a health care device. With the advent of personalized new medicine and non-through syringes, the side effects and pain of patients have decreased dramatically.This is not the future that will be seen in sci-fi movies 20 to 30 years later. It is the year 2025 that the Korea Institute of Technology announced on July 18, assuming the "" 100 future technologies "" would be commercialized. The Academy of Engineering will select 238 leaders with such future technologies and hold an awards ceremony at the Westin Chosun Hotel in Sogong-dong, Seoul on July 19. Chairman Kwon Oh-kyung said, "" Selecting ' 100 technology in the future ' is designed to encourage and develop next-generation young engineers and provide a more systematic reference to the growth of the Korean government's future based on the technology of the government. "" ▽ Graphic : Cha Joon-hong, journalist and journalist, cha.junhong@joongang.co.kr] Seo Jang-won (42), Korea Research Institute for Research in Research on High Efficiency Solar Cell Technology, is leading research into the next generation of solar cells called the Perobskite Solar Cell technology. Perobskite was cheaper than silicon-based solar cells and had the disadvantage of being less efficient and durable despite its easy-to-installation benefits. Seo's technology currently has the highest efficiency rating in the world at 22.7 percent, equivalent to that of silicon solar cells, and it is the fifth time to break the official certification record of the U.S. Institute for renewable energy. Park Jong-hyeok (41), a professor of chemical biology at Yonsei University, is a scientist who drives the era of hydrogen economics, called "" the ultimate green energy. "" In general, hydrogen can be obtained by electrolytic water, but Professor Park can isolate it from the water by using an electric photochemistry cell. We plan to raise the efficiency of the current 8 percent to more than 15 percent that can be commercialized, Park said. Yoo Seung-joo (48), professor of computer science at Seoul National University, was recognized for his next-generation artificial intelligent semiconductor technology. Artificial intelligence represented by deep separation usually requires a great deal of parallel computation. As a result, the processing efficiency of existing computers is significantly decreased. The artificial intelligence semiconductor designed by Professor Yoo can perform the parallel computation of the size of the first time with low power and can maximize the bandwidth and capacity of the memory. When classifying the main players of 238 groups, universities had the highest number of students, 78. It was followed by 76 large businesses, 65 public institutions, including government-affected research institutes, and 19 small businesses. Among the companies, former Samsung employees stood out. It has produced 29 future leaders in such fields as semiconductors, displays, fusion materials and communication. LG Group selected 18 people based on electronic, display and chemistry, and POSCO Group's seven. Considering the possible technology side effects, the technology side effects were considered, followed by SK Group of 6 with 100 technologies for each industry segment and Hyundai Motor Group with 4 from Hyundai Heavy Industries Group and Hyundai Heavy Industries Group. Eugene Robots, Neuro Mecca, Lunit and Rumens, among other promising small businesses, have also introduced the next generation of robot owners. The 100 most advanced technologies of the Korean Academy of Engineering are characterized by being the only future technology selected to determine what sectors Korean private companies are paying attention to in order to discover promising technologies for the future. Existing technologies that were popular in Korea were chosen mainly by academics and experts in the research sector. So, it was based on technological potential, potential, and growth potential rather than corporate potential to enter the market. The Korea Forest Service comprehensively considered the possibility of advancement into new businesses from a corporate point of view, future development by securing key players in the field, and the possibility of finding the next generation growth engines. Suh Yong-seok, professor at KAIST's Graduate School of Future Strategy, said, "" Considering the exponential speed of development and market and social acceptability of technologies, it is highly practical, "" adding, "" It is only with positive aspects of human abuse that are presented.

The white box measuring 30cm by 30cm was too small to fill even the fifth part of the stretcher top below it. Holding a small box containing the child's body, the father cried aloud. The box had the child's name written in black. The two children who did not have names until their death were named after their parents. The bodies of the four newborns who died at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital were held in ambulances at 7:15 a.m. yesterday. The family members were watching, but they shed silent tears. Her husband wrapped around her crying shoulders, and the other parents who were standing on the ground looked alike. She and her family got together in an ambulance with the child's body inside. Four vehicles were then transferred to the Seoul Institute of Scientific Investigation (Guksu) to conduct an autopsy on the body. Lee Han-young, head of the Seoul Institute of Scientific Investigation, announces the autopsy at the National Institute of Scientific Investigation in Seoul yesterday. The autopsy started at 12:20 p.m. and lasted for about 6:30 p.m. Right after the autopsy, Seoul Institute of Scientific Investigation President Lee Han-young held a briefing and said, "" After examining the organs visually, we were unable to collect various samples for possible infection and tissue microscopic examination. "" We can identify the cause of death only when we summarize the results of various tests. We expect it to take about a month for the results of the final autopsy to come out. After examining medical records, including an autopsy, the head of the National Institute of Defense checked to see if all of the children were being intravenous feeding and one was being treated simultaneously. Shortly after the incident, there was also a rumor among the neonate's family that "" the baby's belly had swollen up before death and had difficulty breathing. "" The head of cattle and large intestines was also confirmed by the naked eye by the infants on the same day, but a final decision on whether or not the cause of the gas expansion was necrotic enteritis is likely to come after a close examination. We will work with the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention and police to open up all possibilities and establish the cause thoroughly, the official said. The body returned to the morgue in the order that it had started at 8:05 p.m. The family members who returned together had sad faces. The hospital said, We don`t set up a mortuary for the infants who died on July 19, but only make a visit on July 19. The next day, we plan to have a meeting between the bereaved family and the hospital. The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, which is in charge of investigating medical accidents, will take charge of police investigations. The metropolitan investigation team conducted an intensive investigation into the medical records submitted by the hospital on July 18. We have a massive number of health charts of 20 or more, said an official of the metropolitan team. It could be important evidence as it details what the children ate and what medicines they were given, he said. The investigators also received CCTV cameras to block the floor as a form of voluntary submission from hospitals. We will get a search warrant soon to secure additional data such as the equipment of an incubator. "" We will summon all the medical teams involved in the case and investigate after securing the materials first, he said. According to the police, the medical team at the time had a total of 11 doctors, five nurses, and four more patients who experienced symptoms in the hospital. After the basic investigation by the police is complete, it is highly probable that it will take much time before the precise results of the investigation are revealed due to the need of an appraisal procedure by the Korean Medical Association and the Korean Medical Dispute Resolution Service. In case of medical accidents, it usually takes months for the results to come out when left to the doctors ` association or others to express their feelings, an official at the team said. ◆ Return to intensive care unit One person : One in four newborns were admitted to the same hospital the 16th day of their serial deaths, and the same afternoon, one in four infants who were discharged from the hospital was confirmed to have readmitted. After undergoing tests at the hospital, the infant was judged to be healthy and returned home with his parents. However, I had a high fever at around 8 p.m. and went to the same hospital again. As the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit is closed down, the child is currently being treated in a general ward. Other than the baby, the mother of a non-discharged infant suddenly called me at night to say, I can go home. He then reported that the intensive care unit of newborns should be closed.

It is infected mainly through contact with patients, the medical team, and medical equipment. There have been several reports of medical infections in the past due to the medical team's "" hand "" spread.Three of the four newborns who died at Ewha Womans University's Mok-dong Hospital were diagnosed with the fungus. The KCDC on November 18 revealed that "" when sheets detected in newborns are identified as being used to determine if bacteria from the bacteria are all identical, it is possible to conduct a genetic analysis on a newborn, "" adding, "" If the same infection has occurred in an intensive care unit, it would have been carried out. """" Genetic analysis shows that the same bacteria were infected by newborns, and someone had infected them, "" said Hong Jung-ik, a director of the KCDC. `` The pseudobacter prundicoccus is usually one of the bacteria in the normal intestine and does not cause infections very well. But it is known to make a germ that causes an infection in the hospital for people who are immune to fall.With infected sheets of infants who die, bacteria on the bacteria are more likely to be identical. `` The same germs came out of newborns, and the same resistance to antibiotics, '' Hong said, adding, If it is a fully-illuminated virus, someone could not do a good job and create an infection source. We need to keep investigating the source and how she was infected. The result of the judgment will come out on July 19.Setrobacter Frundi is known to cause infections in respiratory organs, urinary organs and blood. It is one of gram-negative bacteria and is resistant to antibiotics.

The report on employment development by the Ministry of Employment, Labor, Human Resources, and Education, 2016-2026, forecast of change in supply of workers, and increased supply of jobs and supply are needed for the young adults. In particular, the shortage of new workers is likely to worsen as the number of young people is decreasing and the number of graduates is decreasing. Measures are needed to involve the economically inactive population in the labor market, the government explained. The report was revealed as such in the report by the Ministry of Employment and Labor at a Cabinet meeting on July 19, ' Prospects and Suggestions for the Supply and Demand of Mid-term Workers from 2016 to 2026 '. On the supply side, the production-capable population aged 15 to 64 is forecast to fall by 21.8 million. Broken down, it was estimated that the number of persons decreased by 460,000 from 2016 to 2021 and by 2021 to 1,720,000. In particular, starting from 2018, the decline and the decline in the reduction will increase gradually. It is predicted that the number of people aged 15 and over who can produce the products will grow by 2.07 million. Because of the aging population, the number of people over the age of 65 increases significantly. In fact, the age group showed that the number of people aged 60 and over increased by 530,000, and that of people in their 50s increased by 100,000. On the other hand, those in their 40s (- 870,000), 30s (- 530,000), and 15-20 years of age (- 1,930,000) decreased. By academic background, the number of students with lower education ability decreased by 1.25 million during the same period, while that of those with higher education in higher education with higher education of higher than the previous two hundred and thirty thousand. On the side of the demand (employment) forecast, 1.9 million more workers aged 15 and over are employed during the period. The Ministry of Employment and Labor forecast that the industry and the work structure would change significantly due to technological developments and industrial restructuring. By industry, the number of employed people in the health service sector (559,000), professional science (218,000), and manufacturing (217,000) decreased significantly, while that of agriculture, forestry and fishery businesses (- 187,000). The demand for new workers will exceed supply, leading to a shortfall, the Labor Ministry forecast in the next 10 years. This is because the middle-age year population is on the rise, while the young adult population is on the decline, leaving the number of graduates. Broken down, the ministry predicted that the demand for high-school recruitment workers would reach 300,000, while the supply of new workers would be 188,000, which would exceed the demand of 110,000. While the number of college graduates is expected to exceed 100,000, it is estimated that the number of undergraduates (550,000) and graduate schools (300,000) will exceed that of universities. The Ministry of Employment and Labor, however, explained, "" It is not appropriate to interpret the situation as the shortage of new manpower can be resolved by participation by non-economic working people in the labor market. "" An official at the Ministry of Employment and Labor said, "" We intend to build up competitiveness in the service industry and an environment for small businesses to grow, creating good jobs and creating jobs more consistently with young, female, and older adults.

"Jeon Ji-hye, general manager of Jeju Community Credit Cooperative News Agency, announced on July 19 that Jeju's stock farm will temporarily suspend the sale of dogs before the designated natural monument, [Yonhap news agency announced on Sunday]. If the formation of a special committee for the examination of the organization's special committee on animal protection required is designated as a natural monument, the committee will review its composition for systematic family preservation and management. When the Korea Food and Drug Administration announced last July that it had not enough money to deal with the dogs sold to the private sector, it ruled out the three who had died or had their dogs stolen. The National Livestock Insurance Agency started preserving and expanding the pure blood lines of Jeju Island's three dogs (female dogs, 2·3·1) in June 1986. In total, it has sold 144 dogs since 2012 The livestock promotion agency has steadily carried out procedures for designating the dogs as natural monuments, improving the farming environment and preventing cruelty to animals through systematic post management of the owners. The price of the new stock price is also set for the year 2018. Korean beef, chicken, liquid semen, black cattle, and traditional chicken were set to remain at the same level this year. Korean beef is based on the average price of livestock market at local livestock associations three months before sale. The fee is 530,000 won for female pigs, 630,000 won for male pigs, and 7,500 won for liquid crystal. Black pork is priced at 100,000 won and traditional chicken is priced at the market price. Jeju applied the basic and upper limit prices to limit the excessive price rise of a specific individual. The basic price is 600,000 won for females, 500,000 won for males, 700,000 won for females and 7.8 million won for males. The ceiling price is priced at 2.16 million won, for females with more than six months of age, and for males with 2.14 million won. atoz@yna.co.kr announced on July 19 that Yoobit, the virtual currency exchange, lost money due to hacking.

No one accompanied Kim's photos on the front page of the Rodong Sinmun. The Rodong Sinmun reported on July 18 that Chairman Kim Jong Un is visiting the Sun Palace in Kumsusan, Pyongyang, where the body of North Korean leader Kim Il Sung and Chairman Kim Jong Il was buried, on the sixth anniversary of his death.Earlier in the day, the Korean Central News Agency reported to the 11 vice chairman of the Central Committee, including Choe Ryong-hae, on the sixth anniversary of the North`s founder Kim Jong-il, and the chairman of the Supreme People`s Assembly's Standing Committee, Chung and others who were also responsible for the fact thatIt is the first time that North Korean leader Kim Jong Il visited the Sun Palace in Geumsusan on the day of his visit. Chairman Kim paid a visit to the shrine with major party and military leaders during the first and third cycles of the year (2012) to 2014, including his wife, Lissoljo,.After purging Chief of Staff Hyun Young-chul of People's Armed Forces in May 2015, Chairman Kim went to the North alone. At that time, he had six public appearances in May, four without volunteers, and two with the General Affairs Bureau. It is understandable that Kim's visit to the North is related to the recent controversy surrounding North Korea's power relationship, such as Hwang Byung-seo's recent appointment to pay tribute to his wife. It could be an attempt to emphasize that Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il are his own leaders. As the leader who declared completion of the nuclear weapons program, it appears he is trying to secretly show that he is in the same group as Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, a government official said. It is possible that he revealed separately the footage of Kim Jong-un's visit after paying tribute at the same time with other senior officials, said a senior North Korean defector.Amid heightened military tension between the U.S. and North Korea, it is possible that they tried to confuse Chairman Kim Jong Il's plans, which have been exposed to the outside world for security reasons. Kim repeatedly visited the Sun Palace in Geumsusan at midnight every year on Dec. 17 with his attendants. It is possible that the B-2 strategic aircraft from the United States mainland could not have come to the Korean Peninsula suddenly, and that it could have moved on its own with the greatest possible beheading, said Kim Dae-young, a researcher at the Korea National Strategy Institute. Since the event was actually held after three years of mourning, it is possible that it is a process to simplify the event.  North Korean officials are visiting the Korean Revolution Museum in commemoration of the sixth anniversary of the death of Kim Jong Un.Meanwhile, the National Security Strategy Research Institute under the National Intelligence Service (NIS) said yesterday that it is believed that North Korea`s head of the South Korean Reconnaissance Bureau, Chang Kil-seong, was listed on the list. We understand that the inspector general manager has been the head of the unit since 2010, and that he has been promoted to vice chairman of the Central Intelligence Agency as head of the Central Intelligence Agency, said an official of the Central Military Commission. We understand that a serious degradation is being implemented at a ministry, but no return is possible. In the case of former national security minister Kim Won-hong, it is said that he is in a state of invigorableness after being kicked out of the farm. The institute forecast positively that North Korea will participate in the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea`s largest city in terms of the North Korean situation. In addition, we expect increased investment in North Korea`s traditional strategy due to military pressures, such as the U.S. asset purge, to deal a serious blow to the North Korean economy after March next year, said the prime minister, Park Bong-ju, who is responsible for the relocation of the party and high-ranking government officials.Kim Min-seo and Park Soo-chan, reporter of the press at spice7@segye.com ⑨ World Daily news of the world's eye, the global media"

"" We are making it clear that the U.S. is behind the massive cyber fire. "" North Korea has been identified several times as the most likely person to be behind the Warner Crisonware attack, but this is the first time the U.S. government officially admitted it. North Korea is directly responsible for the widespread attack that resulted in billions of dollars in cost, Vauchert said. We don`t raise these accusations lightly, but were based on evidence. Nor are we the only ones to make such a discovery. Other governments and private companies agree.Three Korean companies were also infected with lansofare ware during a massive lanceware attack in various parts of the world. It is estimated that the actual extent of the damage would be larger, even when unknown cases of infection are considered. The Korea Internet Development Agency (KISA) said yesterday that six Korean companies have filed complaints regarding Ransomware, which is scheduled to be officially reported as being out of harm's way, and that three of them will receive technical support.

BBC also quoted intelligence officials as saying that the attack was led by Razarus, a hacker group behind the North Korean government. In October, Microsoft chief executive Brad Smith also said, I strongly believe North Korea was behind the attack. Warner Cry is a lansforware that has disrupted the MS Windows operating system, and caused a great stir by infecting more than 230,000 computers in 150 countries. "" The world is becoming increasingly interconnected and convenient with new technologies, equipment, networks, and systems. "" Unfortunately, the bad guys have begun to take advantage of the enormous opportunities of being anonymous, and the bad ones have caused great confusion. The result of Warner Cry was beyond the economics. We also asked the victims to pay us a ransom, but we can not get the computer out of the infection. It is cowardly and imprudent to make a lot of money, stressed the British medical system, which has paralyzed people`s lives. North Korea has been especially free from restrictions over the years. North Korea`s bad behavior is getting worse and Warner Cruz was indiscriminately reckless, '' he said, To stop such an evil practice begins with responsibility. The government and businesses will work together to reduce cyber risks and increase the burden on hackers. "" The United States will join forces with allies and technology companies to help strengthen the security and resilience of the Internet world, "" Bossart said, adding, "" America is the leader in the Internet security we invented.

"[Hankyoreh] Two Years into the Effective Date of the Korea-Vietnam FTA … Moving from the 4th largest trade injury production base to Vietnam by 48 % by November this year's export volume of USD 43.7 billion could grow by 29 %, beating Korea's graphic trade trend by 148 billion dollars.As Korean electronics makers move from China to Vietnam, the number of overseas production bases for semiconductors, flat displays, and mobile phones is soaring, not to mention exports to Vietnam. The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy announced on December 19 in a report on bilateral trade trends since the ratification of the Korea-Vietnamese Free Trade Agreement (FTA) (December 20, 2015), that the same amount of trade (export + import) with Vietnam increased by $ 4.3 billion this year compared to the previous year. It is significantly higher than the growth rate of global trade (17.3 %) in Korea during this period. Vietnam has emerged as Korea`s fourth-largest trade partner. Exports amounted to $ 43.7 billion (January to November of this year), up 48.4 % from a year ago, mainly on parts and materials needed for local production of Korean businesses operating in Vietnam. In particular, as electronics makers moved their production bases from China to Vietnam, the four biggest electronics makers accounted for 46.7 percent of total exports, including semiconductors, flat displays, wireless communication equipment and electronic equipment. These items are already free from duties according to the World Trade Organization Information Technology Agreement (ITA) and are non-significant items that do not directly receive any tariff removal or reduction benefits under the bilateral free trade agreement. About 5,000 Korean companies have entered Vietnam as of the first half of this year. Samsung's Backnin and Thai Ngo is represented by the Samsung cellular phone plant, Saigon High-technology Park home appliance factory, LG's Hoippong home appliance and cellular phone plant, Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction Company and Korea Electric Power Corporation. Korea's share of Vietnam's total import market was 22.3 % (second place, as of October this year). The gap with Vietnam's No.1 import market, China (27.2 percent), was reduced to 4.9 percent. Korea's export growth rate for China and Vietnam reached - 0.4 % and 6.0 %, - 5.6 % and 24.2 %, and - 9.3 % and 17.5 %, respectively. Import of Korean market from Vietnam is also growing. Import of Vietnamese products rose 29.2 % year-on-year to $ 148 billion (January-November), focusing on wireless communication devices, clothing, and personal items. As Korean electronics makers move from China to Vietnam and expand their overseas production bases, Vietnam is able to process and assemble Korean intermediate parts to export the finished products back to the Korean market. As of October, the top five Vietnamese import items were wireless communication equipment, clothes, personal items, computers, and flat display. These items account for 54.9 % of all Vietnamese import. Korea's trade surplus with Vietnam continues to grow to $ 18 billion in 2015, $ 201 billion in 2016, and $ 28.9 billion between January and November this year. Korea's trade surplus with China was $ 39 billion, followed by Hong Kong with $ 33.5 billion, Vietnam with $ 28.9 billion, and the U.S. with $ 17 billion.

The Seoul Central District Public Prosecutors ' Office announced on July 19 that it indicted Rep. Right after the Sewol accident in April 2014, Rep. Lee calls KBS's chief press secretary Daruja Kim Shigon to edit the problems of government handling and rescue operations, asking them to "" edit them out "" and "" edit the news. Article 4 and Article 105 of the Broadcasting Act, enacted to guarantee freedom of broadcasting and independence, regulate that people who violate the broadcasting control freedom and independence shall face up to two years in jail or a fine of up to 30 million won. Rep. Lee is the first time a related broadcasting law clause has been adopted and is subsequently prosecuted, prosecutors explained. Lee and Kim played a role of promoting the idea of overcoming the national crisis or danger jointly through cooperation with the media after the recordings of their dialogue were released last June. Lee reportedly explained to prosecutors in October that he had shown up as a suspect. But the prosecution judged Lee`s remarks, then presidential key aide who can exert strong influence on KBS, as an act to change the contents of the broadcast beyond appeals. We believe freedom of broadcasting and independence has been defined to protect broadcasting freedom and independence from the nation`s power, and interference with the nation`s power should be strictly limited for freedom of broadcasting and independence, prosecution officials said. Last June, seven media groups, including the National Union of Media Workers, disclosed Lee`s recordings of broadcast involvement and filed complaints with the prosecution. Prosecutors decided to indict the lawmaker after going through a civil affairs committee of the prosecution. The majority of the nine civic committee members reportedly suggested that Lee be prosecuted. Meanwhile, the prosecution cleared former KBS President Gil Hwan-young of charges. Prosecutors said they found it hard to punish the media law by applying the broadcasting law related clauses to the boss of the inner circle, which defines the law to punish non-reporting activities outside broadcasting companies. cha@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"A baby is being born in Seoul on July 19 at the funeral of Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital. December 19, 1712.19 / News 1 / News 1 Yoon-Sung News A A Children Died When Medical Center's "" You Aren't Happy, "" Medical Center's "" Cold, "" Police Department of Health, and Medical Center's Blue NewsA mother who gave birth to a premature baby, a baby twin, nine days old had to send a child to heaven less than 10 days ago. It was the day they reported the birth of another baby who survived.◇ Only one of the twins lived ... ¡ ° That's what a novice baby is like. ¡ ° I reported my first birth before I met him today, ¡ ° On that day, the baby was killed at the funeral parlor at Ewha Womans University. The A-levels left the twins born as premature babies in an intensive care unit at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital for treatment. However, when four newborns were killed one after another on July 16, the couple lost one of their children.Having left his wife who took care of the baby at a location at 9:50 a.m. on her own, she repeatedly sat down and stood up while sitting down in the chairs.Soon after, with a stiff face, he appeared with the body of a baby in a silver box. After moving the box to a moving car waiting for the funeral, the father stared at the box as if he had never left to say goodbye. Eventually, following the guide of the hospital, she got into the car and wiped away the tears.After arriving at Incheon Family Park by car at 11:50 a.m., A began to weep aloud the tears she had borne as she sent her baby box to the crematorium. After crying for a while, she could not stop stealing the tears and had to make a raft of application for the box of ashes to hold the child's bones.A reported the birth of the first child who survived before leaving the second child in the morning. The couple, who had hoped to have a baby, went to the workshop before the twins were born and chose the best name.Having put the remains of the boy's bones in the box after cremation, A said, "" I don't think I can see how doctors could have lost a young baby when they were being treated with such a strong attitude. ""Investigators at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency search and seizure yesterday seek an intensive care unit for newborns at the hospital's Mok-dong Hospital in Seoul, where four infants were killed. September 19, 1717.12.19 / News 1, a sign that was narrowed down to an infection and administration error ... Police, hospital raids, arrest warrants, and cremation as of today remain, the mysterious deaths of newborns remained. At least the doctors ` office said en masse that they could not determine the cause of death, but the first autopsy at the National Institute of Scientific Investigation and a epidemiological investigation by the Center for Disease Control narrowed the results to bacterial infections and mistakes.The National Institute of Scientific Investigation found in its first autopsy report at 7:00 p.m. on July 18 that the cause of the patient's medical error was caused by overdosing fluid with evidence of gas in every newborn baby's cattle and intestines.The head of the Yang Kyung-moo Guksu Research Center said, "" If you take excessive doses of potassium chloride in the body, it is sometimes very fatal to the heart of the sap that is treated with intravenous nutrition. ""Health authorities, who have also surveyed the blood samples of infants who died of cancer, also raised their opinions that they could be deaths from bacterial infections. After confirming the samples of three dead patients who were undergoing a blood culture test at Ewha Womans University's Mok-dong Hospital, the disease control center confirmed that they had developed a seat containing high fever and inflammation, which led to the infection of the cancer.CherobacterplundI is an intestinal bacteria found in normal adults, but when the infant is not immune, it can cause inflammation and high fever in the affected areas. They are known to be infected with respiratory infections, surgical areas and urinary tract, and they are resistant to antibiotics. Other academic circles reported cases of healthcare-related infections through the hands of doctors.The national police, police and health authorities will investigate whether there were medical mistakes by calling in medical personnel who were in the intensive care unit of a newborn infant while conducting on-site reviews and pathological examination while maintaining a close cooperation system.Police also launched full-scale investigation, including search and seizure of hospitals. The team in charge of medical accidents at the metropolitan police department of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency sent 13 investigators and officials of the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention to the intensive care unit and computer center of Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital, where they seized the incubator, medical records, and injection sets.Dongchoy 89 @. Ahn Cheol-sang, the candidate for Supreme Court justice, admitted to having falsely transferred to Seoul three times due to a problem with his children and apologized on July 19. Ahn said at a parliamentary confirmation hearing in the morning, "" I asked Kim Jin-tae, a member of the Free Korea Party, if you accept the fact that you were transferred to the party falsely. "" I have done it once and twice, my eldest daughter and eldest son. When I was told by Kim that the five principles against high-ranking officials are to be adopted, I was disappointed with myself and felt that my mistakes were great. I feel sorry for the public. As for why I pretended to be in a nearby apartment, he said, "" I think I owe you a ride to elementary school when I was seven, so I explained my big boy was born in February 1988. "" (My wife says, "" I was a little bit younger and I wanted to give him a ride. "") Regarding the fake transfer to the address of a mother-in-law, who is not even a relative, Ahn added, I moved it in consultation with my mother-in-law to my mother-in-law's friends ` house. According to Kim, An`s daughter reported moving into an apartment in the southeastern port city of Busan in 1993 due to an admission problem. The son falsely transferred to an apartment in Suyeong-gu, Busan twice, October 1997 and February 2001. All the false residencies were in the residence of a friend of his mother-in-law, Mr.Chung. Ahn was informed by a prosecution that his daughter had been hired by a famous law firm and a large company because she was a high-ranking official, adding that she would have been granted preferential treatment at a private institute when she completed her education at Sejong University. As for the suspicion that CJ hired an accountant, not an in-house lawyer, but a daughter, he also said, I don't think so. We could submit it if we needed to, ' he said. ironn108@newsis.com>"
"The most expensive palace in the world, Paris suburb of ' Chateau Louis XIV. ' P.S. CogemadN YT ' Prince Mohammed, Crown Prince David Cogemanes and National Embankment Marble with Ghost Company, ' which can be carved into a rock and roll.Located 15 minutes from Paris, the Chateahua Mansion, located in the suburbs, boasts picturesque scenery and is worth an estimated 300 million dollars (approximately 326.06 billion won). Fortune called it the "" World's Most Expensive House. ""However, the identity of the person who purchased the house in 2015 has been shrouded in mystery. However, the New York Times ' own report on July 17 revealed that the house owner, Mohamed Bin, the 32-year-old Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, was found to be buying the house.The original owner of the house was hidden behind a bogus company listed in France, Luxembourg, according to the newspaper. The bogus company is owned by a Saudi company called Ait Investment Company (EIC), which New York said was administered by the head of the prince's private foundation.The Saudi royal advisers have admitted that the house was eventually the home of Prince Mohammed.The French suburb of Paris, called "" Chateau Louis XIV "" and the CogemadEIC were found to have become the other luxury goods purchase route for Crown Prince Mohamed. He reportedly purchased a 132-meter-long yacht from a Russian tycoon in 2015, which cost him 500 million dollars (approximately 544.3 billion won).Therefore, it is possible that the real estate near Paris, which EIC purchased recently and is currently transforming into a hunting ground, was also involved with Prince Mohamed.Prince Vinsalman is also suspected of being the buyer of the room of Leonardo Davinch, which was sold for a record price of $ 450.3 million (about 492.2 billion won) at an art auction. The winning bid was confirmed to be the prince close to the Prince.NYT points out, "" The irony is that the prince, who declares that in Saudi Arabia, enjoys luxury abroad. ""Saudi has been struggling financially over the past few years due to falling global oil prices, tightening its belts over government spending. The continual buying of luxury goods and the leisurely vacation in southern France could deal a fatal blow to the image of the "" social reformer "" on the part of the prince.Former CIA analyst Bruce Liddell said he wanted to create an image of Mohamed as a different (from other royal) and more reform-driven (as a very successful) ghost, but he was quite successful.The Saudi government and the Crown Prince Mohamed were silent on the request of the newspaper to confirm the news.Set up a news and photo report on PyeongChang 2018.Former North Korean general secretary Hwang Byung-seo is known to be "" constantly purged and punished by North Korea's military and high-ranking elite targets, "" and former head of the North Korean Central Intelligence Agency and former South Korean political bureau Kim Byung-cheong are known to be in charge of violent behavior. Former Director Hwang was demoted from being a county chief by king to a left-of-left officer, while former Deputy Director Kim reportedly saw his status fall to that of agricultural workers. Unlike Hwang, Kim was dismissed by the ruling party and appears to have fallen into a state of insolvency. The National Security Strategy Research Institute, a state-run think tank under the National Intelligence Service, is set to end its sentence not by the 8th annual inspection point in 2018, but by the former chief of the National Defense Agency and the senior elite who have been punishing the ruling party chief and fighting corruption. The process is likely to draw a wave of complaints from the military. The NIS recently reported from the National Assembly that former head of the ruling Workers ` Party, Choe Ryong-hae, the head of the organizing committee at the National Assembly, had been under investigation and punished by former head of the bureau. Lee Ki-dong, director of the North Korean Systems Research Institute, said, If we believe Hwang has received a military post far below the limit and now works for a ministry, we can assume that he has played a possible role in the leadership. On the other hand, I believe he is working as a farm employee at a farm, Kim said, adding, When he was forced to resign as head of the National Security Agency, he was found to have been involved in corruption charges. I don`t think it will be easy to make a comeback.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is visiting the Sun Palace in Kumsusan, Pyongyang, where the bodies of his father Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il were buried, on the sixth anniversary of the North`s founder Kim Jong-il's death. Unlike previous years, when a large number of high-ranking officials were present, Kim paid a visit to the shrine alone this year. We have a basket of flowers under the name of Kim Jong Un in front of the statue of Kim Il-sung (right). Choi`s vice chairman, who worked with Kim`s younger brother Kim Yeo-jung, is known to have also served as the head of a labor union under the Workers ` Party. Lee said, The fact that Choe, who was first vice minister of public relations and propaganda, has become a working group manager is the very example of North Korea`s emphasis on youth projects is key to the youth project in the Kim era. It is a context to strengthen the foundation of a long-term government. According to Real Estate 114 on July 19, the total number of residents nationwide was 43,366 in January 2018.This is an increase of more than 20,000 households, even compared with a total of 23,365 households who earned homes in January this year. It has more than doubled in the past three years from the average household (21,016 households). By region, 27,291 households were expected to move in from the Seoul metropolitan area, with 92 percent (28,895 households) concentrated in the economy. In rural areas, the largest number of residents is in Gyeongnam (3624 households). Δ Busan 23-95 households in North Gyeongsang Province Δ Busan 2308 households Δ South Jeolla Province (South Jeolla Province), Δ Sejong households (South Jeolla Province), Δ 1218 households, Δ North Chungcheong, Δ 687 households, Δ Ulsan, and Δ Gwangju, 595 households in Jeju (Jeju), Δ 349 households and Δ 230 households. The problem is that beginning 2018, the nation will see its debt strengthened and the capital gains taxes implemented in earnest. This is why some say that the polarization of Seoul and provincial areas can continue amid tougher regulations on real estate. In particular, apartment prices in the Seoul metropolitan area have fluctuated depending on their location. In Gyeonggi Province, Gimpo City is receiving favorable rates for its development, including the urban railway, and surcharges. Meanwhile, the Hwaseong city government has continued to see a decline in apartment prices due to oversupply. In Seoul, too, the buying and selling people's attention and reconstruction apartments are leading to higher prices and continuing to strengthen housing prices. Meanwhile, due to the large volume of land moved in, the Hwaseong City, Gyeonggi Province, and other cities are expected to adjust the rental market price and avoid paying more. Construction companies are largely blamed for the flood after 2015, said Lee Hyun-soo, an economist at Real Estate 114."

The ministry announced its investigation results on various irregularities committed by Park during her tenure, saying, The government officials involved in Park Seung-choon did not recognize the alleged irregularities, or made a decision to reduce them. It is not an issue that will affect the official discipline of the ministry or the livelihood and welfare of our veterans ` families in the future, he stressed. The ministry is known to have launched an investigation into alleged irregularities during Park's tenure, shortly after he took office in May. One of the most notable suspicions concerning Park's involvement in politics was the ministry's involvement in security and education projects with a strong conservative hue. Since Park Seung-choon took office in 2011, the ministry has been involved in the presidential election by promoting security education by developing various programs, the ministry said. Korean defense intelligence agency who monitor the North Korean soldiers, a retired Army lieutenant general trends of the Park, the former head as director of Veterans Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak administration six years and three months.He and the security ideology led the spread of assessments paid by education project.

As a result, "" A proper national defense official, a historical officer, and a sense of citizenship "" spread. Though it was pointed out that the ministry's main duty of honoring and welfare for those who have contributed to the country and for those who have contributed to democracy was not suitable, Park pushed for the security education. The national security education team, organized by the Love and Education Division of the Republic of Korea, has been embroiled in controversy that public security education conducted at schools, public institutions and military units is politically biased.Park Seung-choon, former head of the National Intelligence Service, also produced and distributed "" National Defense Veterans Education and Training Center, "" a national security education DVD. After taking office, the head of the ministry expressed his will to reform national security education in a briefing to the Presidential Advisory Committee on National Policy Planning, and in July, he scrapped the office of national education and education. The ministry's resolution of the damages is expected to spread to the overall reform of the organization subject to supervision, not to the request of former head of the ministry Park to investigate. Some veterans ' group is suspected of taking part in 'a government-inspired demonstration' Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak administration. The ministry is making a breach of duty of trust on charges of investigating alleged defoliants ' compensation for travel expenses, welfare, and payment of construction costs without exact grounds. The ministry also conducted an independent political activity for the original purpose set by the defoliant law in connection with the Preference`s activities, in which it was accused of conducting controlled demonstrations under the direction of Cheong Wa Dae. According to prosecutors ' investigation into Park and others, the scope of the ministry's liquidation of damages could be extended. The ministry said, With an 11 percent increase in the budget, my wife should obey the people`s will to ask for proper respect to the veterans ` families and ensure that taxpayers ` money is properly spent on the veterans ` families. We are also encouraged by our request to investigate and discipline inside, to restore public transparency and neutrality among government agencies, and to make a clean sweep of past wrongdoings by relishing our commitment to reform our national services. ljglory@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
