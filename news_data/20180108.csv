European countries and China are suffering from extreme weather fluctuations, including storms and snow storms.Several men struggle to pull a car out of the snow at Asbury Park, New Jersey, Tuesday./ AP CNN and the Associated Press reported that the "" bomb cyclone with heavy snow and strong winds "" hit Canada and the eastern United States, causing plane cancellation and casualties.A bomb cyclone is a low-pressure storm created by combining wet air from the Atlantic Ocean with cold air from the North Pole.Under the storm, the daily highs were below minus 6.6 degrees Celsius for the seventh straight day, the coldest week in more than a century since January 1918.It snowed in the southernmost U.S. state of Florida for the first time in 30 years on July 4. The Florida capital city of Talara has about an inch (2.5 cm) of snow, the first snow-capable snow fall in Florida since 1989.Plants froze and hang icicles from trees in Panama City, southern Florida, on July 3./ The damage from the AP continued. AP reported on July 6 (local time) that about 100 million people were suffering from the falling temperatures in Mount Washington, New Hampshire, and the low temperature of minus 38 and minus 69.4.The temperature in Mount Washington is similar to Armstrong in Ontario, Canada, which is known as the coldest place in the world. U.S. health authorities warned against frostbite if skin remains exposed in the weather within 10 minutes.Temperatures in eastern Canada's Ontario and Quebec are also forecast to approach - 50 degrees Celsius.Due to the situation, airline operations have also been disrupted. More than 3,240 international flights were delayed on July 6, and John F. Kennedy (Kennedy) of New York and Charleston Airport of South Carolina were the most damaging.As the water pipe burst at JFK Airport's terminal 4 ceiling, it flooded the terminal's floor, interrupting international flight services for some 30 airlines that went to and from the terminal.More than 500 planes were canceled at JFK Airport from the morning of July 5 to the afternoon of July 7, and around 1400 were delayed, according to Flight Urware, a flight tracking site.There were also casualties. At least 19 people were killed in heart attacks and frostbite caused by the deadly storms.On the other hand, Australia in the southern hemisphere is experiencing record heat. According to AFP, the temperature of Australia's Sydney sub-feeders rose to 47.3 degrees on July 7, the highest since 1939.Burnings Warehouse, Australia's General Tools and Materials Department, is posting a message saying it will stop baking sausages because of the heat wave forecast./ Australian issuing company (TAB) Twitter, photo capture Australian authorities banned the use of outdoors as an emergency. In addition, the Australian Open, a major tennis tournament held in Sydney, Australia, was stopped during the heat wave, which was over 40 degrees Celsius.Such unusual weather changes are occurring all over the world, including China and Europe. France lost at least 200 million euros (258 million U.S. dollars) to the landing of its fourth storm of the year, Eleanor, following the one that landed on New Year's first day of the year.Eleanor had caused an avalanche in the mountains and increased sharply on the Seine. The Seine River, located near Austerlitz Station in downtown Paris, rose from 1.8 meters a week ago to 3.1 meters in the evening of July 4.The French government issued an "" Amber Alert "" on July 4 and advised citizens not to stay in basements or keep important assets in basements. In addition, the French and Japanese provinces evacuated homeless people living in tents on the Seine River.Spain had a blizzard. Due to the heavy snow that started yesterday, 3,000 vehicles were cut off nearly 24 hours from Madrid, the capital of Spain, to Segovia, a northwestern city. The Spanish army responded by mobilizing heavy equipment to rescue them.Heavy snow in Anhui Province / Traffic Broadcasting System in China is also suffering from severe snowstorms. As the Chinese province of Anhui Province and HubeI Province suffered losses of up to 40 billion won on July 3, more than one billion people died in China's central region.As it continued to fall, China's Railroad stopped operating on 45 train routes from Beijing, and made certain arrangements to slow down.

Some say Intel rivals ARM and AMD are not safe either.Intel has been selling x86 with the vulnerabilities identified for more than 10 years, and experts worry that the only solution that is currently available is software patches.According to the IT industry on July 8, not only Intel, Microsoft, Google, and other security companies are announcing software upgrades to solve the situation, but also it is hard to say that this is the fundamental solution.Because of the two architectures, ▲ / Down, and the architecture of the security vulnerabilities caused by the CPU design, ◇, and ▲ / and Spectre. Kim Seung-ju, a professor at Korea University's Graduate School of Information Protection, said, "" In order to maximize the CPU's performance, the sequence of commands was ignored and the order of commands to be read in advance was predicted by the order of commands. "" This means that a multI-user system such as cloud services could be more damaging.◇ Intel Processor Correspondent Impact Area, which has been released since 1995, is said to be targeted at Intel Processor, which has been released since 1995. However, Google Project Zero, who first raised the issue in June last year, said ARM and AMD were also faulty in security. Apple is also raising anxiety by announcing that the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers are affected by such vulnerabilities."" That vulnerability started using it about 20 years ago to boost CPU performance, "" East Security said on a tablet blog, "" whereas the hacker could have read it from another computer in the memory of the program. """" The vulnerability was discovered by Google researchers in June last year and received an acknowledgement from Intel on the basis of the bug rounting fee, "" said Professor Kim, ' but Intel did not take any action this year to protect itself. 'Brian Krjanik, Intel CEOS, was found to have sold 14 million dollars worth of own shares at the end of November last year, sparking controversy.▲ Intel CPU Security Vulnerability Comparison (Source : East Security Tables) ◇ Security patches are the answer?… without a fundamental solution, the U.S. Incident Response Team (US-CERT) recommended security updates, and Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have also begun updating their offerings. Dozens of domestic and foreign companies have released security updates such as Intel, AMD, ARM, Apple, Cisco, Seatrix, trend microstructure, F5 Networks, and tablets.However, the report also pointed out that a security update does not prevent hackers from attacking the company 100 percent, and that the security patch could cause poor performance. Some social networking sites even post articles saying, "" It only takes one day to make an attack code using weak points. ""The fundamental method is either to redesign the CPU architecture or to make it impossible, said Professor Kim Seung-joo, We are making SW updates as an alternative, but this can not stop the meltdown in all cases either.Security updates may reduce system performance by 5 to 30 percent, he added.Accordingly, Korean security companies are verifying compatibility of their security product lines with their security patches, and they exchange information on the CPU gates in real time through separate communities.[Daily Lee Dong-hoon] reporter Kim Hyun-ah (chaos@edaily.co.kr) < ⓒ jonghap Economic Information Media Idaly - Unauthorized and Redistribution >"

It is analyzed that the wholesale network price reduction corresponding to cost did not meet expectations, and the price competitiveness decreased due to the 25 % rate discount. According to the related industries on July 8, CJ Hello Mobile, the largest operator, ended the "" 10 GB 33 Rate "" event on October 31, which provided unlimited data, voice and text messages for 33,000 won a month. Although the event, which began with a limited time limit, attracted subscribers with the best selection cost in the industry, it is unclear whether it can continue this year. Hello Mobile is currently running an event that provides an alternative of 22,000 won per month with 10 GB of data and 100 minutes of voice call. Eswon Ansim Mobile Co. raised the price of its promotional plan for major mental note fees this year from last year. The fee, which includes 6GB of data, rose from 28,600 won per month to 30,800 won, and the unlimited data plan went from 32,890 won to 41,690 won. It appears that only U-Plus (U +) saving mobile is actively taking action. The soft-to-use mobile phone is selling unlimited data at 32,890 won, and recently, it even introduced a 10,000-won data plan that provides up to 20 gigabytes of data without any voice or text messages. Small and mid-sized manufacturers can hardly afford to pay any substantial amount of money to promote their products aggressively. Except for the large conglomerates ' affiliated phone companies, it is hard to find a place to sell unlimited data plan for 30,000 won. This is because the unlimited fare system loses money when it sells. Moreover, as wholesale price cuts failed to meet expectations last year, the financial burden of the saving phone business got larger. The wholesale price of the LTE data plan was cut by an average of 7.2 percent this year, but the so-called unlimited fee system of 11 GB or more reduced by only 1.3 to 3.3 percent. It is a blow for the saving-phone industry, which has been shifting away from 2G and LTE as the new growth engine. A 25 percent discount has also negatively affected the competitiveness of the cheap phones. Unrestricted rates are an area where direct competition from the three handset makers is inevitable, as the price gap with the installment of the three handset makers shrank from 20 percent to 25 percent on Sept. 15 last year. Industry watchers say the unlimited pricing system has taken a toll on the subscriber base, but it is hard to sell at a cost of almost no wholesale price. okko@yna.co.kr ▽ Seoul = Yonhap News Agency (2018.1.8) = As the cold air near the North Pole has taken a sudden turn for the worse, the Korean Peninsula is likely to freeze all this week. According to the Korea Meteorological Administration's mid-terms forecast on July 8, temperatures nationwide are expected to be below the average of - 12-18 degrees Celsius and maximum - 0-8 degrees Celsius. The cold snap comes as frigid air from July 9 flowed back down to Korea. Starting this day, the temperature will drop significantly and the wind will be strong, further reducing the overall temperature. The cold snap is expected to ease slightly from next week when it peaks on 11 to 12. The lowest temperature in the nation is forecast to be 11 ~ 16 - 6 degrees Celsius and 12 - 17 - 7 degrees Celsius. This is similar to December 12 (- 18.6 to - 2.8 degrees), the coldest day this winter, and July 13 (- 18.8 to - 2.4 degrees). In particular, the lowest temperatures in Seoul during this period will be - 12 degrees Celsius and - 13 degrees Celsius, respectively, which is expected to be below last year's level of - 12.3 degrees Celsius and 13 degrees Celsius, respectively, and suffer a harsh winter. The strong freeze attack was caused by the Arctic cold air moving toward the nation due to high pressure near Alaska, the agency explained. Because of the high pressure in Alaska, the cold air that should move forward was forced to come down to Korea with the high pressure separating it from the high pressure. For example, a stream flows by and meets a big rock and splits itself. As the high pressure is reaching the North Pole, the air can not pass up and is coming down further, a KMA official explained. In fact, this winter has been especially cold as conditions for cold air to go south. As a result, the characteristics of the three Han Saon (cold and warm weather patterns for three to four days) are rarely shown. We have had a negative Arctic quake that began in mid-November, said an official at the Korea Meteorological Administration. As the upper high pressure formed near the Ural Mountains and the Kara Sea continued to stagnate, the cold days continued to follow as cooler air flowed in and out of the country, the official said. "" As the days of cold grew colder, the properties of the three rivers have become sluggish this winter, "" the official said.[Table] Temperature at 24 major locations across the country (minimummaximum, unity:unit) ※ soho@yna.co.kr as of 6 a.m. 8th.

' Starting as early as March, children's after-school English lessons will be banned. The Education Ministry recently requested the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the children's home's special department, to ban English lessons after school starting in March. According to the law, kindergarten, first and second graders are prohibited from taking English lessons after school, so children's homes are also banned. The Ministry of Education is in charge of the anti-learning law and the Ministry of Health and Welfare is in charge of the childcare center. The ministry also agreed that child-care schools should be banned from English, such as kindergarten and lower grades. The date of the ban will be announced later this month after consultations.

Kim criticized, I don`t know why not ban English kindergarten, which costs more than one million won per month, from having cheap English tasting courses at around 30,000 won in the public education system. The petition board of the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae lists 100 conditions with the same opinion as Kim. As English institutions are prohibited, all full-time English institutes for infants (so called English kindergartens) are not subject to the Ministry's "" No Pre-Learn Learning Act. "" His name is kindergarten, but in reality, he is a private academy. P institute in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. We offer classes from 9:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. every day. One native English speaker, one Korean homeroom teacher and two Korean teachers will be in charge of the class. The textbooks used in American elementary schools are used as state textbooks. The monthly cost is 1.43 million won (car, meals, etc.). The goal is to create an American elementary school diploma or two when you graduate from school by the age of five, an official at the institute explained. Chung (41, a student), who sends his 5-year-old son here, said, I was satisfied to have a good reading of English fairy tales, and a good understanding of kindergartener programs. Another parent (46) said, "" I went to America for about two years, so I spent more time on my daily conversation lessons with foreigners. According to a recent survey conducted by a civic group, "" World Without Private Education worries, "" there were 237 English-language preschools in Seoul as of the end of 2016. The average monthly tuition fee for private academies is about 3.1 million won, with a maximum of 2.16 million won. The lessons are five hours and seven minutes.

"Unkindness, the higher the number of reports than refusal to ride, so if you have evidence of various types of verbal abuse, intimidation or sexual harassment in Seoul, you shouldn't have to pay a penalty, "" taxi drivers, frequent monitoring by saying, "" No problem found. Because of what happened in the taxi not long ago. Arriving in front of his home, his destination, he handed the taxi driver a credit card to pay for the trip. The engineer then asked, "" Give me cash, my card is broken. "" The fare was about 3,000 won, but Mr. A did not have cash. To the embarrassed Mr. A, I asked, Don't you carry any money with you? I am ignorant because I live in a rented apartment. Eventually, he withdrew cash from nearby banks and paid his bill. She recorded the situation on her smartphone and reported the incident via a 120 Dasan Call report. `` I felt disgraceful about where I live. I can not take a taxi because I am so scared from now on. The engineer was given an administrative disposition that imposed a penalty of 50,000 won. Some cabbies are going too far with their ' verbal violence ' against passengers at journalist Kim Joo-won's zoom@joongang.co.kr According to the Seoul Metropolitan Government, the non-believing report was passed by the non-believing one in 2015, which was the highest percentage of taxi complaints in the nation. In the 20,407 cases of taxi complaints between January and November last year, the ' unkind ' (6898 cases, 33.8 %) accounted for the most. More than the number of reports of no passengers (6176 cases · 30.2 %). Kim Jeong-seon, a traffic guide at Seoul Metropolitan Government, said, "" Some issues are won, but drivers are more likely to get hurt when they refuse to ride, so they seem to pick up passengers and respond unkindly. "" Refusing to ride will cancel the taxi if you are fined three times. Graphic : Kim Joo-won, a journalist and a female employee in her 20s, also reported something unpleasant in a taxi cab. He took a taxi with a well-built boyfriend who got off first near his house in an alley. It was an alley that could turn, but the driver was irritated. After all, the driver lowered the window and shouted at his boyfriend as he walked. "" This is XX, that's why you're getting fat. "" In addition to "" personal abuse, "" the type of article that is fined includes intimidation and harassment. A 30-year-old male office worker complained on the phone to a taxi driver who lost contact for decades even after accepting the call, and was threatened to kill him.Female passengers were sometimes told to look up at their faces, or to ask for a ' dirty picture ' of their cell phones, as they felt they were working at a bar. One male passenger was also ' beaten ' by a man who was caught by the neck for complaining to a knight who had come down the route he had not requested. Of course, it is the story of some taxi drivers. Taxi drivers said they were sorry that unkindness was seen as a problem for the whole. `` The behavior of some of the articles is clearly wrong, '' Cho Wook-cheon, 58, an engineer, said. Still, as transportation becomes more diverse, the daily rate of taxi ride has dropped to 60 percent. The stress of the articles is high amid the deteriorating working conditions, he said. Some passengers are reporting that they are taking it out on the reporting system, said Jeong Jong-jin, 58, an engineer. The problem is that 90 percent of the unkind reports are not ' deficient ' in evidence and are not subject to administrative action. I took a taxi with my 70-year-old mother, whom the driver spoke in irritated language to her. It is still annoying that we could not report it because we did not have any evidence. Experts say the reason for the unkind taxi is its lack of good education, lack of ongoing monitoring and a serious lack of volunteers. In Japan, where the taxi service is excellent, there is a taxi service management institution that is independent from the government and local governments. In this area, which consists of experts and citizens, the driver is properly trained and monitored, and a good taxi company provides certification. We need to benchmark it, too. Since the drivers ` situation is so bad, taxi companies say, ` Let's just pick and see. ` We should also pay attention to the poor working conditions of taxi drivers. We plan to concentrate on managing some sort of blacklisting for articles that are frequently reported, said Kim Jeong-sun, a traffic guidance manager. The unkind report can be called by calling Dasan 120, and sending the documentary evidence to e-mail at (taxi120@seoul.go.kr) Ryu Hyo-jin, a 28, was unable to get over his lethargy after news of his supervisor's sudden resignation recently.

Park said, "" I always wanted to follow the same senior who works with passion, but I couldn't find work because I felt it would be useless to work hard. ""The 20s to 30s are complaining of "" coin depression. "" As the number of young people making large sums of money from virtual currency transactions grows, they feel relatively deprived.

A 35-year-old businessman at a large company was disappointed when he heard that his acquaintance recently invested 200 million won in virtual currency and made 1 billion won in three weeks.

The target is Δ apartments and building management businesses concerned of minimum wage violations Δ supermarket superstore Δ gas station Δ gas station, and there are 5 vulnerable businesses to report minimum wage violations to local authorities (reporting). Prior to the regular inspection, it was established as a time to send letters, meet meetings, and explanation sessions from 8th to 28th of this month to provide an opportunity for businesses to independently observe the minimum wage and stabilize jobs.Afterwards, from March 29 to the end of March, 5,000 business sites will be selected and inspected intensively, which will improve their effectiveness. The inspection will focus on the observance of minimum wage and the revision of the wage system or the reduction of working hours to avoid the possibility of raising the minimum wage. The company will order the violation to be corrected and the owners who fail to comply or have violated the minimum wage for the past three years will be prosecuted immediately.In addition, the analysis of the types of wage avoidance after the inspection will be reflected in the basic labor order inspection (approximately 10,000) that will be conducted in April.We will strictly respond to employers who illegally or conveniently avoid the minimum wage hikes even after the guidance period, said Kim Young-ju, Minister of Employment and Public Affairs at the time of inspection.Report to the public!

"China's system semiconductor market is 16 times larger than Korea's, according to a recent report. Some say China has become a superpower in the system semiconductor field. While sales of Korean system semiconductor industries have been flat for the past 10 years, China is soaring at about 20 percent a year. If this trend continues, the gap is expected to widen. China is ready to chase even memory, and semiconductor Korea is worried that its status could quickly drop.According to the Korea Semiconductor Industry Association on July 7, the domestic semiconductor industry, which is represented by system semiconductors, is estimated to have about 2 trillion won in sales last year. An association official explained, The total sales figures of Korean companies grew to more than two digits per year from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s, but have been flat since 2007 and 2008.According to a study by Taiwan's market research firm Trend Force, sales in China's business last year were estimated at 2006 billion yuan (approximately 32.8 trillion won). The figure is a 22 percent rise year-on-year. The Chinese company, Fantast Force, predicted, "" The Chinese market will grow 20 percent this year and total sales will reach 240.7 billion yuan (39.5 trillion won). "" If sales of Korean companies remain at a standstill this year, the gap will grow 20 times larger. Even though Samsung Electronics ' semiconductor division, System LSI's annual sales (estimated at 7 trillion won), are added, the gap with China is not small.China is speeding not only up external growth but also up internal growth. China's paeplies industry entered the market in the early and mid 2000s with low-priced products. These days, it is doing well in the premium field. China's largest company, Hi-Silicon, is producing mobile application processor (AP) for smartphones into a 10-nano process. Sales reached 38.7 billion yuan (6.6 trillion won) last year, or about the same as Samsung's system LSI business unit.ZTE Microelectronics has developed a narrowband object Internet (NB- IoT) chip solution as it opens its doors. Including high silicon, Tsinghua UnI Group's spread spectrum RDA and Datang launched a chip solution for 5G networks. Semiconductor is leading the way in smart cards and security chips. The Gudix is expected to catch up with Sweden Fingerprint Card (FPC), the industry leader in the smartphone fingerprint recognition chip solution market, soon. With the exception of Tsinghua UnI Group's spread spectrum RDA, China's top 10 businesses have experienced 20 to 30 percent growth in single digits. It is analyzed that expanding sales of premium products is effective.Most of the top 10 Korean companies are estimated to have experienced a year-on-year increase in annual sales last year. The trend has been going on for many years. Because of this, many say that the government should expand its product portfolio, customer companies, and target market.A representative of Korean companies said, In the early and mid 2000s, Korean companies focused on one family, one client, and one local market, but the environment changed and they turned into negative growth. Among them, several companies have been forced to improve their fundamental constitution.The number of experts has decreased significantly from the past, academics said. The main reason for this is that the government has little research and development policies for nurturing the semiconductor sector. System semiconductor design has already declined to become unpopular.We should clearly recognize that Korea is a memory powerhouse, not a semiconductor powerhouse, said Song Yong-ho, a professor of electronics at Hanyang University, adding, It is not the time to just open fire with the recent boom.▽ Han Joo-yeop, a semiconductor reporter powerusr@etnews.com According to the Health and Welfare Ministry and the Korea Health Insurance Corporation on November 8, the maximum monthly health insurance premium for employers ' compensation was 3,836 workers as of November 2017. As of November 2017, it represents 0.023 % of the total number of subscribers to workplaces with 18.82 million. The number of high-income workers who pay premiums on health insurance for office subscribers increased to 2,508 in 2012, 522 in 2013, 3,893 in 2014, and 3,833 in 2015. The increase in the number of high-paid employees who pay premiums each year reflects the growing reality that hundreds of millions of salaried workers earn a year. According to the National Tax Service's National Tax Service's report, the annual salary of more than 100 million won increased from 362,000 in 2011 to 653,000 in 2016, the first time it exceeded 600,000. Local subscribers who pay a premium on health insurance for local subscribers (monthly premium of 227,700 320 won) increased from 359 in 2012 to 421 in 2013, 480 in 2014, and 573 in 2015 Unlike taxes, health insurance is a social insurance, so that no amount of income or property can raise insurance premiums indefinitely, and when the income is higher than a certain level, one can pay only the upper limit. The Health Insurance Corp. currently charges higher-paid employers with monthly premiums of 70.81 million won or more to pay up to 2.93 million won per month. The maximum premium has been maintained since 2011, when it was raised to the level of the average insurance premium for office subscribers in 2010. The ministry, however, has revised its monthly premium of 70.81 million won from July to 30.9 million won for salaried workers who received monthly benefits, with the government's plan to increase their financial burden and lower the burden on the low-income bracket.Office wage difference (PG) [Production Choi Ja-yoon] shg@yna.co.kr [Driver's report and inquiry] ▶-to-one chatting with reporters ; recently scheduled trend 7 (local time) in Prague, Czech Republic of Korea ; and getting on the subway without pants.

"- The highest weekly rate of increase following last week's announcement of housing reconstruction in Seoul of the past, such as an increase in real estate holding taxes after the government and local elections. - A draft plan to revise regulations on apartment prices in the first half of the year in Songpa district was announced. Photo : Shin Tae-hyeon, a journalist.▽ Lee Dae-lee : As the increase in housing prices in Seoul has not stopped, the government is paying keen attention to whether it will come up with another measure.According to Real Estate 114, prices of apartments to be reconstructed in Seoul rose 0.74 percent last week, the highest weekly rate since the announcement of real estate measures in August last year. There is an assessment in the market that ' white medicine is invalid '. It is an embarrassment for the government, which has been coming up with successive measures. In fact, the government has pledged to come up with additional measures whenever real estate measures were announced last year, and if housing prices are not affected. The ministry said it will monitor the market conditions and consider countermeasures.The problem is that there is no sharp way to catch the overheated property market now. The government is ready to take out the last strong card, which was considered a property tax hike, but it is not yet a factor of psychological pressure. The outline of the property tax hike is also expected to be unveiled in July and August after the local elections this year. Government under president's policy planning committee in the financial reforms as early as the first half, the special committee to raise property tax reform measures within the draft.There is a plan. However, experts say that it is generally expected that it will be too sensitive to raise the property tax burden before the June local elections when the parties are strongly opposed to paying taxes.It is questionable whether the increase in property taxes will control housing prices in Seoul. Currently, it is seen that the government will not increase the comprehensive real estate tax burden by raising fair market price or official land prices, and that although it does not suggest that it will increase taxes on multiple home owners, it is possible to suggest that it will increase the tax rate on new homes by 100 million won every week. We already have various regulations, including the transfer of multiple home ownership taxes, and the extent to which we can introduce property taxes in the future is questionable, said Dr. Kim Soo-yeon, head of the company`s apartment team.Kwon So-hyun (juddie@edaily.co.kr) < © 5 Kits combine a comprehensive financial information media edaily - illegal from redistribution of the war damage and > at Gimpo Airport at 9:30 a.m. on August 8, ... prevent vessel other than the National Assembly speaker.Strictly prevent outlook for president … door, unknown to us president elevated strategic partnership discussions, including visiting uae kaldun, no access to the media … it stays 'alleged uae'.The possibility of 'imperfect combustion' (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) Kim Seung Wook Journalist : United Arab Emirates (uae) Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a close associate of tax kaldun, Khalifa Al Mubarak.Abu Dhabi government, chief of the visit. Last month, Im Jong-seok president's secretariat, president of the Moon Jae-in million nearly a month after Mohammed to prevent the tax system as a special envoy of the president. The exact purpose of Kaldun's visit to Seoul is not known, but the focus will be on boosting Korea- UAE relations overall first, diplomatic sources say. Our country and uae in December 2009, Lee Myung-bak (mb) the former president visited the uae after a 'strategic partnership' when this relationship is maintained to date. Caldun's visit is expected to discuss how the current strategic partnership can be upgraded to a full-scale strategic partnership. So much so that Kaldun occupies a very high political position in his country. Kaldun is known as the most trusted man in the UAE royal family (New York Times), while Abu Dhabi, the chief of state affairs, is the prime minister. It is also the head of the UAE nuclear plant committee, which covers the nation`s nuclear plant project, the largest-ever project of the nation`s top tax office, as it has direct ties to Baraka, Korea`s nuclear plant under construction there. Cheong Wa Dae has described Lim's visit to the UAE as a "" visit to strengthen the partnership between the two countries "" and analyzed various ways to strengthen the bilateral ties based on the nature of Kaldun's return visit. Lim Korea is the head of the kaldun directly are expected to prevent the president to meet the door. In this case, the president of formally the tax system that we would like to invite uae the baraka, and is expected to deliver nuclear power plants to completion at the time of the visiting president of uae the door.Expected to go ahead. However, the point of watching the game is whether Kaldun will clear up all suspicions surrounding Lim's trip to the UAE. In fact, since Lim's visit to Korea early last month, various suspicions have been raised in Korea, focusing on the opposition and the media. At first, it was rumored that the UAE was the former nuclear power source of North Korea, but Lim's contact with North Korea was reportedly lost, and the government's decision to investigate the corruption committed by the UAE's nuclear plant industry is expected to break up. The main opposition Grand National Party then launched an offensive, demanding a parliamentary investigation into Lee`s visit to the UAE to appease diplomatic disconnections, but Cheong Wa Dae denied the allegation by taking a roundabout route. Recently, the rumor of military cooperation has emerged persuasive. Rep. Kim Jong-dae, former National Assembly Defense Committee in the Justice Party government claims to have been all the way, mb uae nuclear power sites when Kim Tae-young, the Defense Department as a kind of 'a behind-the-scenes agreement' related to exports.Secretary Moon Jae-in have signed a mutual defense pact, which made a government, is that the causes of conflict and uae. In this regard, Heo Nam-shik, the Ministry of Defence recently met the politician in Moon Jae-in uae in its past mb administration and military the (mou) memorandum of understanding signed.Trying to modify uae the raised the issue, up the pieces to Lim was reportedly explains that visiting uae. When Minister Song visited the UAE last November, he explained, "" We had some procedural problems with the MOU signed by former Minister Kim in 2009, and under Korean law, we had to submit it to the National Assembly or make changes. "" However, Song is said to be keeping quiet, saying, "" We can not disclose the details of the MOU signed by former minister Kim. "" Some say the MOU was signed by former Minister Kim during his two trips to UAE in November 2009. Regarding the MOU, some argue that Korean troops will automatically intervene if an emergency occurs in UAE. The report says the Ark unit sent to the UAE to train its ability to carry out special warfare, and provided it provides military support to the UAE royals in case of emergency, such a provision is actually necessary for the military alliance. Despite various suspicions over the past month since Lim's visit to the UAE, Cheong Wa Dae has failed to provide a clear explanation on the grounds that it is a diplomatic issue with whom it faces. As Kaldun, the chief of the National Assembly, who is presumed to know the truth of the allegation most, visited Korea, it is noteworthy whether all the suspicions could be resolved. Kaldun was the person who sat next to the Prince's tax office when Lim paid a courtesy call on the tax to the ruling party, and is considered the key figure to quell rumors of UAE conflicts. However, Commissioner Kaldun has no opportunity to hold a news conference or contact with the media during his visit, and the two-day schedule and movement is tightly covered in mystery. The detailed schedule is not known at all except for preventing National Assembly Speaker Chung Se-kyun. It is also very unlikely that Kaldun, the chief of the Administration, would publicly mention the suspicion as it is a diplomatically sensitive issue. Therefore, it is questionable whether the suspicions surrounding Lim's visit to the UAE can be resolved properly. Rather, suspicions remain and could be sealed in the state of "" incomplete combustion, "" a form of political debate.

(Photo : Yonhap news agency) [IdalI Park Jong-oh] insured 16 million won for intentionally getting into contact with reversing cars and cars entering gas stations while riding a motorcycle. Mr. A, who has reached adulthood, became more daring. He borrowed an import motorcycle and a rental car and made contact with traffic signal violation accident. The total amount of insurance money the insurance company received from the settlement money of insurance companies and repair fees through the 25 cases of the accident on such initiative amounts to 152 million won. The Financial Supervisory Service said Monday that it will investigate 30 suspected insurance fraud offenders at an investigation agency after investigating a two-wheeled car and rental car accident. The FSS used the insurance company's insurance policies and insurance fraud recognition system that the young man aged 20 to 28 received in the 2010-2016 accident of a two-wheeler car and rental car to cover up fraud. According to the report on the status of vehicle detection used for insurance fraud (Data = Financial Supervisory Service), they received 2.3 billion won in insurance premiums for 793 insurance accidents during the period. The average person is 26 cases and 77 million won. Among the 30 suspects, 17 received insurance from both two-wheelers and rental cars. Among them, 12 were born between 1993 and 1997, when they were to be surveyed. When he was a minor, he tried to cheat on insurance through a motorcycle, and received a higher insurance payment on a deliberate accident to use a rental car when he reached adulthood. Among the total 619 two-wheeled cars, the number of lane changes was the highest among those of two-wheelers. This means that the cars were mainly involved in intentional contact accidents. Following them were intersection (90 cases), car reversing (69 cases), rear collision (40 cases), law violations, and pedestrians (29 each). Of 174 rental cars, the maximum number of lane changes was 101, followed by rear impact crashes (20), intersection (18), reversing cars (11), pedestrians (6) and law violations (5). There were 177 cases in which the juniors and seniors repeatedly involved in lane change accidents with motorcycles or rental cars, or intentionally involved the perpetrators and victims. The occupants of the vehicle are to be compensated for any damages, whether they fail or fail. If an acquaintance accidentally caused an accident by playing the role of an offender, the premium is not very high, and insurance premium sharing plans of insurance companies could be used to pay for the accident without burden. Among the 30 youth suspected of fraud, the maximum beneficiary of the insurance premium was 1,680 million won in 34 accidents. One young man caused 90 accidents (insurance premiums of 150 million won) by himself. Despite the minor accident, he was hospitalized for a long time and agreed to receive 1 billion won from insurance companies. The FSS is planning to report 30 suspects to the investigation agency on suspicion of obtaining insurance fraud under the special insurance fraud prevention law. Twelve people, including six offenders involved in the incident, and those who repeatedly visited the vehicle, will also join the investigation. If the fraud charges are finalized, the special law will allow a person to be sentenced to up to 10 years in jail or to 50 million won in fines.

"We see more ' guaranteed working hours ' than ' salary ' when choosing new employees, [image source = Getty image bank] [Asian business reporter and new ' lifestyle trend ' that means ' modern work-life ' Companies started to protect their employees by improving their working conditions as more and more students prepare to resign from work as soon as they enter the company.Companies are increasingly moving to introduce an advanced work culture to reduce working hours and introduce flexible working hours. Korean conglomerates, including Shinsegae, broke down the nation`s legal work hours of 40 hours per week and offered some radical work conditions of 35 hours per week. This is a type of work that was only available in advanced European companies.Businesses say that joining the Warracheon craze is aimed at boosting work productivity and efficiency while providing employees with a ' leisurely life. ' In the past, however, companies tended to regard late workers, frequent overtime, and employees who arrive on holidays as so-called "" good employees. "" Why do businesses change their attitudes and encourage employees to take up residence in Warrack?It is a strategy of companies to catch ' young dropouts. ' Recently, there have been a growing number of "" retirements "" in their 20s and 30s preparing for retirement. The Korea Employers Federation conducted a survey of 306 companies nationwide on the status of recruitment in 2016 and found that the percentage of new employees who leave university within a year had grown to 27.7 percent. In other words, they found jobs in difficult working conditions, but they are ready to resign as soon as they enter the company and leave within a year.The job portal's survey of 2935 job seekers revealed that new employees ranked the ` work hours guaranteed ` first, beating ' salary level. ' Office workers were also asked to choose ' one of the most desirable life of a high salary and dinner. ' More than 70 percent chose the ' one with dinner ' to live in an overwhelming sense, rather than money.Consumer studies at Seoul National University professor Kim Nan-do has defined the young office worker born in 1994 as the Warrachen generation since 1988. According to Kim, the older generation of Worajang, unlike their parents who put priority on stability, conservatism and promotion, does not want to sacrifice their lives. And because these are the ones who will exercise the most influence on society in the future, businesses can not ignore the needs of the 20s and 30s.The companies ' slogan of ' enhancing efficiency ' is also true. Companies that introduced flexible working hours said, "" Since the implementation of the system, employees have become more satisfied with their work, more attentive to their work, and more productive. "" In fact, the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry and McKinsey conducted a survey of 41,951 salaried workers and found that only 45 percent of the workers who worked two to three days a week were productive at work, while only 57 percent worked at night. In other words, too much work can actually cause a decline in productivity.This new way of thinking for the 2030 generation is changing the way businesses treat their employees. In the same vein, it is not only about working hours, but also avoiding unnecessary meetings, formal dinners, and the culture of military organization.▶ subscription channel Asian economies, ▶ 'Military talk' # # in the press i_dentity@asiae.co.kr ▶ yangnakkyu yunsinwon < © 5 Kits combine the Windows of the world economy the Asian economy.Deployment ban unauthorized war damage eyes, Asian economies > [The Dong-A Ilbo] - ‘fire’, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, Seoul, Wednesday afternoon to go back five, Daechi-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, a Apt., that is not a holiday and to work.Full of the vehicle is in the parking lot.

It took time to call the driver because the fire broke out at 4:30 a.m. Work has begun to move the vehicles one by one. Only 20 minutes later, an expensive ladder car and a pump car were brought in. However, a woman in her 50s who hung on the veranda to avoid the fire ended up dead. It has been 11 years, but the situation of apartment A has not changed. Still out of parking spaces, the car is parked three times. Only enough passage had been secured to fit a car. To enter and turn off the fire engine, a space of 7 to 8 meters is needed. No car can pass through the night or in the early morning, said a resident Lim (45).Hong Jin-hwan, a reporter at Kangnam Fire Station in Seoul, sent an official letter to A apartment on July 4 saying, "" Please refrain from using triple parking to secure a fire lane. "" However, some residents did not worry too much when they saw an official notice posted on the front door of the apartment building. One resident said, Surely another fire will break out. This is not the only place that fails to utilize the lessons of disaster. Starting July 5, Dong-A Ilbo's team went back to Seoul and five other areas that were devastated by previous fires. There is one thing that the fire truck is behind schedule because of the parking vehicles. It has been 17 years, and at least one year and four months, but the fire engine still remains out of order. Vehicles were also standing on the side streets of Hongje-dong, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul. Six firefighters died at the same time in March 2001 when a building collapsed while trying to put out the blaze. The yellow paint on the side streets left out the words ' emergency vehicle passes. ' There was also a place where an adult could pass by. Choi (55), a resident of the town, said bitterly, It would be the same if the fire started then and now.○ The residential area in Hongje-dong, Seoul, where six firefighters died after the initial evolution of the illegal state-controlled vehicle 17 years before the invasion of the alleys, was condemned by concessions and consideration. The alleys were still ' occupied ' by traffic. Jong-Seung-yoon reporter Tomato 99 @ donga.com 2015 Urban Housing fires in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province were caused by the use of pilotis and flam-butters. In particular, the initial response of the fire department was delayed due to the parking vehicles. The government and local governments have included designation of areas around the site as non-mainstream areas in their follow-up measures. However, three years later, the area is still not prohibited from driving on the main road. It is because some residents strongly oppose it. A restaurant owner near the fire scene said, I don`t feel comfortable with customers visiting the store. If we try to control the car, we have no choice but to reduce our customers. Parking was still repeated "" layer by layer "" at the fire site of apartment B in Ssangmun-dong, Dobong-dong, Seoul, in September 2016, when three of the family's five members died. We have to be careful because we sometimes protest the management office that the security is unkind when we call the car to move, one security guard said. The same goes for apartments in Siheung, Gyeonggi Province, where three people died in September 2014. "" What am I supposed to do when I don't have enough space to park my car, "" the residents told a reporter about the parking situation. However, if you do not leave your hands open until you have enough space to park your car, the disaster will likely repeat. Law should be strictly enforced at fire sites and residents and local governments should actively prepare an alternative for securing fire routes. As the Framework Act on Fire Services takes effect on Fire Services, the government decided to take active measures against illegal parking to block the passage of fire trucks on June 27. We will exclude the compensation for any damage if the cars are improperly parked, said a SMPA official. We will come up with detailed measures to benchmark American cases in which firefighters are not responsible.Bae Joon-woo, reporter of the newspaper, Choi Ji-sun ; Facebook officially meets the Dong-A Ilbo, Dongah Ilbo, Donga.com, Hot Economic Issues, Redistributions (click!) ; No reproduction."

"A revision to the tax law will take effect on those who pay an additional 600 million won per year in capital gains taxes, such as Busan Gijang, Sejong Jochiwon, and 5.1 million won in income tax deductions, and exclude married people aged 30 or younger from the sale. The areas in Busan Gijang-gun and Jochiwon are excluded from the list of areas subject to multiple tenant tax while owners of two-house apartments will not face higher rates if they sell their homes in Busan or Sejong City due to school conditions. The Strategy and Finance Ministry announced a revision to this year`s tax law yesterday. The Act provided for the implementation of specific details concerning the 17 amendment tax laws, including income tax and corporate tax. The new measures will take effect during February after consultation with related ministries, advance notice of legislation and Cabinet meetings. Main contents of the revision of the Enforcement Decree of the tax law are up to 62 percent of taxes on both sides, and the capital gains taxes on which the tax is to be adjusted will be excluded from April 1. The government announced last year`s real estate measures on Aug. 2, which include capital gains taxes when transferring multiple home owners to affected areas and revising related laws. An additional 20 % point for owners of three or more homes and 10 % point for those with two or more housing units is added to the basic rate of the rent (6-42 %). This would raise the tax rate on both sides by up to 62 percent. Among the areas to be adjusted are 25 districts in Seoul and Gwacheon, Seongnam, Hanam, Goyang, Namyangju in Gyeonggi-do, Gwangmyeong and Dongtan in Hwaseong, Haeundae, Donghan, Suyeong, Suyeong, Busan, and Nam-gu. However, the Enforcement Decree excluded the standard market value of apartments outside of the Greater Seoul area, metropolitan area, and in the counties, towns, and the Myeong-myeon areas of the Greater Seoul area. Among the areas to be adjusted, 10 cities and provinces belong to Gijang-gun and Sejong, Jochiwon and Yeongi. Therefore, if one is in Seoul and one is in Haeundae-gu, Busan, it is subject to transfer taxes, but if the other is in Seoul and one is in Gijang-gun, Busan, it is excluded from the list. Local homes will also be exempt from the number of homes in question, the ministry said. In addition, those who own two apartments will not be eligible for sale when they sell houses that are built in Sejong, Busan, or those that have been acquired for medical care due to school conditions, work conditions or illness. However, the tax amount is less than 300 million won in housing acquisition, and then it is sold within three years after the cancellation of the reason. The owners of the right to sell tickets in areas subject to arbitration were also relieved. The revision requires the transfer of the right to sell the land in the designated area to apply a heavier tax rate of 50 %. However, the enforcement ordinance on the relocation is aimed at excluding the homeless, who had no other right to sell or sell, and who is over the age of 30 (including those with a spouse under the age of 30), from being eligible. The married range includes the death of a spouse or a divorce. If you ever get married, you meet your qualifications. In addition, the ministry decided to exclude homes for children with more than five years from the number of homes that have been operated when one home was judged as having been built. When two homes were built as a home for the welfare of their parents, they now have to sell one in five years to get tax-free, but need to do so within 10 years. The guarantee insurance policy for the return of the rent deposit (rent deposit less than 300 million won) also provides benefits to subscribers of the insurance premium tax credit that has been applied to life insurance, injury insurance and damage insurance. DCC's high income tax base is tightened. Starting this year, the yearly income earner, who pays 600 million won per annum, will pay 5.1 million won more income tax (based on withholding tax). The government has raised the maximum tax rate for income tax, which exceeds the 500 million won threshold by 40 percent and the maximum tax rate by two percent since this year. According to the revised tax table for working income, monthly wage will be 50 million won (600,000,000,000 won) and monthly 1,653,840 won (4,500,000 won) for people with three dependents. The figure is an increase of 427,700 won per month and 5.51 million to 8400 won per year from last year. However, you can pay back or pay more of the tax when you pay the taxes by the end of the year. The scope of the major shareholders, who are subject to tax reduction on gains from stock sales, will also be expanded significantly. KOSPI will have a total market capitalization of more than 1.5 billion won from April, 1 billion won from April 2020, and 300 million won from April 2021. The exemption also excludes the use of tax-free exceptions on pre-dedicated housing. In reality, if one house is inherited from a household with one house in it, the owners of existing apartments were transferred regardless of when they were given one, and were exempt from paying taxes. However, if there are houses or apartments that are given pre-dedicated gifts within two years of the inheritance, one should pay a transfer tax when selling regular apartments. There are many cases of shirking taxes by giving in advance. The requirement to pay inheritance taxes in kind, such as real estate, instead of cash, will become more stringent. Now, payment of real estate and securities was allowed relatively easily, but only the financial assets or the listed stocks or bonds that are available for cash were deducted from the payment. In particular, non-listed stocks, which have been subject to controversy due to their difficulties in calculating their value, should not be allowed to be paid in water if they can be paid inheritance tax with properties other than those that are not listed. ▽ Notification of duties paid by overseas credit card companies = Pay more attention to spending money on overseas trips. If the amount of cash withdrawn from the credit card market exceeds $ 5,000 per quarter, the customs authorities will notify the government of the payment, but in future, it will be given more than $ 600. Taxes on the costs of manuscripts and lectures are also expected to rise. Currently, 80 percent of the other income sources include the expense rate needed for plaintiffs, lecture fees and advisory fees, but it will be cut to 70 percent in April and 60 percent next year. As the cost ratio falls, taxes will grow. Sejong = Park Jin-seok, reporter Kailas @ jo ng Joongang.co.crk."

It is rather convenient not to have to go into details, Cho said.The desert area, where machines play the role of human beings, is expanding. There are many places to use unmanned services, ranging from fast food restaurants to PC rooms, cafes, and even security services. There are positive views, but there are concerns that there will be fewer jobs.The biggest benefit of unmanned systems for businesses is cost.

At 2018.1.7 / News 1 through News 1 at Yonsei University, schools, service providers and workers are in conflict over expanding the unmanned security system. Yonsei University decided last year to close some of its security posts without filling vacancies created by its 14 guards ' retirement from retirement, adding, "" We have strengthened the work of existing workers and others. ""Some say that the machine is running to an extent it can not replace. One Yonsei guard pointed out, however good it is, that there is something human to do, and students should wait when there is an emergency.Another security worker, Choi (66), also said, It is better for someone to come in and out of the city to come in and out of the country, and to keep an eye on the mountain climbers and other related inquiries. Business circles expect that the introduction of unmanned systems could accelerate as minimum wage increases. According to the Korea Employers Federation, a survey of the business outlook last month showed that one out of four respondents (24.6 %) answered that the increase in minimum wage was the influence on corporate management by increasing the minimum wage. It was the second largest employers, following a 37.7 percent decline in employment. dhk@news1.krTo a report!

"Choi Jong-koo, head of the Financial Services Commission, told the government in Jongno on July 8 that the bank will block transactions between banks and the virtual currency exchange.The Financial Services Commission has launched an "" test run "" against the virtual currency exchange. The operation is called Two Track. By blocking transactions between banks and the virtual currency exchange, the bank will block the money supply and crack down on illegal activities by directly investigating the virtual currency exchange. Choi Jong-koo, chairman of the Financial Services Commission, held a press briefing at the Seoul Central Government Office on July 8 to suggest measures against the "" virtual currency speculation "" that has not been stabilized despite successive government measures. Choi said in a briefing, ' Since virtual currency transactions are most likely to be used for money laundering, such as hiding crimes and illicit funds, the bank could have given the right to make such comments and encouraged the banks to follow them, ' a review of virtual currency transactions was made. The purpose of the meeting was to explain the background of the Financial Information Analyst (FIU) and the Financial Supervisory Service's inspection of the ' Fund-launder's Implementation of Money Determination obligations ' of virtual currency transactions, but the final purpose of the transaction was to disclose the purpose of the Virtual Banking Inspection. In fact, Choi said, "" If any improper or illegal results from an inspection on banks are found, the financial regulator may consider blocking some operations, such as blocking virtual accounts, "" but added that it is not likely to stop using the virtual currency transaction. Virtual currency exchanges, which are traded via corporate accounts without virtual accounts, are also subject to the money laundering prevention inspections. Virtual currency exchanges should be assessed against the fulfillment of the Bank's money laundering obligations and should be stopped when they are not appropriate. If transactions between banks and the virtual currency exchange are blocked, it will be difficult to add new investment funds. We can not completely stop investment, but we intend to reduce it by making it as uncomfortable as possible, a financial official said. If regulation by banking is indirect, investigation of the virtual currency exchange is direct. The government is cracking down on crimes such as price manipulation, multi-stage fraud and the laundering of similar funds on virtual currency exchanges. The government has never looked directly into the virtual currency exchange. Chairman Choi pointed out, Nobody really knows what is going on inside of the virtual currency exchange, to the point of doubting whether the hacking scandal is a fabrication. In particular, we will see if the virtual currency operators actually have virtual currencies, he said. Since the virtual currency exchange is not subject to financial authorities ' supervision, prosecutors or police are likely to take charge of the investigation. The government also announced that it is in the process of regulating the transaction of virtual currencies by law. We are discussing ways to limit the cases to similar cases and to see if we can move to the special law, proposed by the Ministry of Justice, said Financial Services Commission Director Choi Hoon. ▽ Correspondencies by the people next to me now = Received free comic reports and gifts ~ ; and also, last year, a reporter of "" Cheerleader vs. Racing Girl "" ; and "" Employability "" by Joo Jin-ho ; and "" Real time news with money "" ; Kim Hyeon-seop, chief of the computer information bureau at Gangnam District Office, was found guilty of embezzlement by the district's chief prosecutor, saying, "" I don't know whether it's serious or not, "" on November 8, 2004.

"Only 16 students entered Jongno Gyodong Elementary School, where the number of students who were admitted to elementary schools decreased by 2.05 percent compared to last year (Yonhap news agency). Last year, the number of students to elementary schools in Seoul increased sharply. This year, 77,222 students from elementary schools in Seoul were admitted to elementary schools, a drop of 2.05 percent (1,615) from last year (78,867). The photo shows an elementary school in Seoul held a preliminary call for 557 public elementary school students on July 8. Lee Jae-young, a reporter at the Seoul Combined News Agency, reported that out of 557 public elementary schools in Seoul, 37 mini-schools have been organized by only one or two classes per year. Public schools in Seoul will hold a preliminary reunion for freshmen on July 8. According to the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, there are 37 public elementary schools with less than two freshman classes, or 6.6 percent of the total number of students, due to less than 50 students enrolled this year. Of these, there are two schools that have only ' first class ' classes in their first grade because they have very few freshmen. Only 16 and 19 students are admitted to Kyodong Changchon and Chang-cheon, Jongno-gu, central Seoul, this year. Bon-dong, Dongjak-gu, Seoul, had 20 students per class (22.3 students per elementary school class in 2017), but two classes were organized in the first grade. Along with the first two schools, Daecheong Elementary School in Gangnam, Hwayang Elementary in Gwangjeong, Deungmyeong Elementary School in Gangseo, Sageung in Seongdong-gu, and Myeonbukcho in Jungnang-gu had 20 students. Yeonsin Elementary School (52), Banghyeon Elementary (55), and Anamcho (59) in Seongbuk-gu had more than 50 applicants, but only two classes were made in the first grade. This year's entrance requirements for elementary schools in Seoul totaled 78,867, a decline of 2.05 percent (1,615) from last year's (78,867). The number of applicants for elementary schools in Seoul increased from 81,294 in 2013 to 85,684 the following year, but decreased to 81,116 and 76,423 in 2015 and 2016, respectively.

The year 2014 and last year were the year when the number of applicants increased, and the year of the first year of the golden pig band 2007 and the year of the white tiger entered elementary school. As the belief has it that having a good belt means succeeding, the number of elementary school students who were born in a year with high birth rates has decreased. As the number of new students decreases, the size of elementary schools is decreasing. The number of students per elementary school in Seoul decreased to 907 in 2011, 845 in 2012, 786 in 2013, 764 in 2014, 752 in 2015, 726 in 2016 and 710 in 2017.

"Minimum wage hikes cost…Resistant residents living in apartment complexes with reduced security guards failed to pay the extra cost of keeping an extra 2,000 to 4,000 won per household (Junghoe Apartment, Daejeon).According to the Center for Non-standard Workers in Gwangju on October 8, apartments in the north of Seoul and in the west of Seoul decreased guards. This is to reduce the labor burden associated with minimum wage hikes. 16 out of 32 people lost their jobs in apartment A, and 4 out of 10 people in apartment B lost their jobs. According to the Gwangju non-regular workers ' support center, if the total number of security workers is maintained at the same size last year, the administrative costs of apartments will increase by about 2,000 to 4,000 won per month depending on the size of households. As the minimum wage and salary increases were visible, apartments did not receive residents ' cooperation names from last fall or held a representative meeting to end the contract with the staff on July 31. Security guards who were frequently pointed out by the elderly and residents in their mid-70s were reported to have been targeted for layoffs. Until last year, two apartment guards kept one apartment for each other 24 hours. Since the reduction in the number of employees, one person has managed two jobs, adding to the burden of work. Security guards from the service provider have an indirect contract with the apartment building every three months. Apartment security guards in Seoul are all in their 70s, and receive about 128 million won in monthly pay. It is known that B apartments are relatively low-aged and pay a little more.The non-regular workers ' support center tried to reduce the size of their staff, asking the Gwangju Labor Union and their apartments to provide them with job security, but it did not work out. Unemployed guards, together, accepted the layoffs without raising any problems with one resident or with the residents ' council. Guards at an apartment in Daejeon lost their jobs en masse. Kim (63), who worked as a security guard for an apartment in Yuseong-gu for seven months, received a notice on December 30 last year to fire. Kim had good relationship with residents of apartments and never caused any problems, but the service company dismissed him without even explaining why. Four of the apartment's eight guards, including Kim, were kicked out of their jobs on the same day. I expected my household to get better from the rise in minimum wage, but I had the opposite situation of losing my job, Kim sighed. He went on to say, "" Today (8th) at 9:05 a.m. I went to the Employment and Welfare Plus Center, where many people were already waiting in line for work, like waiting for me at the window. "" We don`t have any other options because we can not point out the unfair dismissal measures, said an official at the Gwangju non-regular workers ` support center. hs@yna.co.kr ▽ North Korean restaurant recently closed after posting a notice of closing and closing the restaurant in Shanghai. Chinese authorities ordered all North Korean businesses in China to be closed until July 9, and Beijing, Shenyang and Dandong restaurants along the border, and Shanghai are closing restaurants in the country. A day before the deadline for the closure of North Korean businesses, the North Korean restaurant Moran abruptly closed its doors to the Xita, which leads to the Korean Town in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, northeastern Seoul. The North Korean restaurant usually sent maids to its gates for about 10 minutes to train and then promoted them to passers-by and tourists. But when they visited the restaurant in time for the workout, the gates were given a notice to suspend business due to an internal repair, and the employees did not show up.When I called a contact number from the North Korean restaurant closing announcement at Shenyang Cita in China, I could not say when the self-appointed man decided to resume the temporary closing process for interior construction. The man denied that the decision was related to the closure of North Korean businesses, saying, "" It is not relevant. "" But he said, "" I have several female employees who are currently working for Chosun (North Korea) who are scheduled to return to Shenyang on their vacation. "" The restaurant was operating normally until last week and the morning employees showed up constantly doing gymnastics, said one owner of a restaurant near the restaurant, I am puzzled by the sudden closing. About 10 North Korean restaurants are operating in the Sita area. Only one of the companies confirmed to have closed their business until that day, but others are known to have faced pressure from authorities to suspend business. One North Korean restaurant in Shenyang said, "" It's General Kim Jong-un's Birthday Day, "" and held a ceremony to celebrate North Korean workers ' sales with coffee houses on the second floor.Ryugyung Restaurant, directly operated by North Korea's central office in Dandong, Liaoning Province, which is located between Sinuiju and Aprok River in China, was recently closed down. Song Do-won, a North Korean restaurant run by a Chinese owner in Dandong, reportedly ran a business, but the visas of North Korean maids living here have expired and are scheduled to return to North Korea. Chinese authorities ordered all North Korean companies in the country to close within 120 days beginning Sept. 12, when the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution to impose sanctions on them. The deadline for the closure is July 9. More than 100 North Korean restaurants in China have been sought to replace their foreign currency earned by North Korea over the past few years, but have been subject to additional sanctions due to mounting international pressure following a series of North Korea`s nuclear tests. Hundreds of North Korean companies including cumulative restaurants entered China in late October last year, investing about $ 100 million.North Korean restaurants in Dandong, China have reportedly struggled recently with pressure from China on maids to refuse to extend visas, notify of suspension and suspend joint operations. North Korean restaurants have not been seeking survival by changing their operations to joint ventures with China, changing their names to Chinese, or switching their businesses to other forms such as McFubar, all told reporters. In Shanghai, many North Korean restaurant brands including restaurants ' cleaners and bushfishers closed their doors and withdrew during the past month. A considerable number of North Korean restaurants in Shanghai, once operated by around 10 companies, have been withdrawn, except for a few of them, including the Presidential Office in Pyongyang, which is currently in charge of managing operations in the GubeI area. Three North Korean restaurants operating in Hangzhou and two others in Suzhou are also known to be closed. A source close to North Korea`s nuclear border said, China's Free Trade Ministry issued an official notice late last year, saying, The Industrial Bureau of Trade in Yangyang would suspend operations in five major North Korean restaurants in Shitta, forcing North Korea`s nuclear industry agencies to halt within 50 days. China, which has joined the United Nations sanctions on North Korea, seems to have difficulty maintaining a North Korean restaurant as it has repeatedly issued a visa extension ban for North Korean workers and pressured to halt their operations, he predicted.Beijing's famous North Korean restaurant, the Eun Ban-gwan, was operating normally but was mostly bleached by Chinese restaurants. At the Eun Ban-kwan Restaurant, Moranbong, the music of the band that led the indoor atmosphere, was turned into Western classical music and no menus for North Korean food were served. The restaurant manager said, "" The restaurant owner has recently changed to a Chinese, "" adding, "" We are working on a new menu based on Chinese food. "" Among the employees, Chinese people were sometimes seen, but North Korean women still made up the majority. North Korean employees who received orders in Chinese said, I am from Pyongyang, when asked whether I am Chinese. A North Korean restaurant official close to the North Korean embassy said, We have not heard from the Chinese government's policy of shutting down the restaurant. A Korean resident at Okryugwan restaurant said, We have no problem using the restaurant. However, since the owners of the Okryugwan have already turned Chinese, most of the restaurants in North Korea are believed to have drained the color of their restaurants by transferring their shares. Meanwhile, Chinese authorities are likely to start cracking down on violators soon after the deadline for closing down their businesses in North Korea has expired.Dandong Ryugyeong's Restaurant [Yonhap News Agency photo] recently closed."
"Tesla's show room is known to be the most important example of Tesla's innovation in August. Red lights are on everywhere. The reason is the failure of model 3, which Tesla presented as a supply model. Since its debut in March last year, the company has received advance orders for the down payment of $ 1,000 (approximately $ 106 million) from 400,000. However, there is a serious setback in the mass production schedule of Model-3. In general, the CEO of the company had claimed to produce 5,000 units per week since July last year, but he only produced 220 cars throughout the third quarter. Fourth quarter shipments also remained at around 1550. News of 5,000 weekly production has been delayed to November last year, March this year and June this year. Model 3, waiting for owners at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California. Production delays have led to class action lawsuits. Reuters : The company explained that one of the four battery makers has experienced bottlenecks and delayed production. Industry experts analyzed that although automation programming needs to be re-stalled first, it is currently being carried out manually, and that it is called Hasewol. Tesla's acquisition of Furbics, an automated device maker, in November last year was also a desperate measure to solve the problem of production lines. The original strategy of the company to improve profitability through model three has gone awry. Last year alone, the company posted a net loss of $ 644 million (approximately 660 billion won). The deficit will grow after losing $ 290 million in 2014 and $ 899 million in 2015. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) recently warned, If Tesla is unable to answer how to supply model 3, it could face a real crisis. Business Insider said, The primary problem is that the amount of cash reserves are ridiculously small compared to traditional car makers, and Tesla will have the problem this year. Ford has $ 40 billion, GM has $ 25 billion, and Fiat Chrysler has $ 20 billion, while Tesla has just over $ 3 billion. Bloomberg also predicted last month that if Tesla fails to add more capital, he would run out of cash by August. Tesla's supply model No. 3. [Reuters] Moreover, it is hard to ensure profitability even though battery raw material costs, such as lithium and cobalt, rise, restore production capacity. Due to the global electric car boom, raw material prices such as lithium are jumping to double-digit rates. To make matters worse, customers are moving in a class action suit, claiming that Tesla was involved in the first release of model No. 3 and delivery timing. Wall Street investors are changing Tesla's views on investment to selling this year. Tesla opened a new roadster with a genuine electric truck in December and began receiving pre-contracting contracts to resolve the crisis. The contract is $ 5,000 for a semi truck and $ 50,000 for a roadster. However, the reliability associated with model 3 is problematic and the response is poor. There is another variable. It is the chase after Chinese electronics maker Faraday Future. Last year, FF911, the new car which opened at CES 2017 in Las Vegas, sold for 120,000 U.S. dollars, and began mass production.

"Banks plan to be more rigorous in their screening of loans with the introduction of the DTI (total debt payment ratio) and DSR (total repayment ability) in the first quarter of this year. The Bank of Korea's loan patterns report released on July 8 showed that the outlook for the domestic banks ` lending attitude index in the first quarter was - 18, 10 points down from the fourth quarter of last year (- 8). The survey is a numerical representation of the trends and prospects of lending attitudes, with numbers distributed between - 100 and 100. A negative forecast means financial institutions plan to tighten their screening procedures on loans, such as interest rates and maturity extensions, more than they said they would ease the screening. By car owners, banks ` lending to small and midsize businesses is likely to remain tight. Household mortgage loans were - 30, down 3 points from the previous quarter (- 27). Household loans, including credit loans, were - 13. It is down 4 points from the previous quarter, but is still negative. Small and mid-sized companies made a negative switch from the third quarter last year to the first quarter. Only large companies were forecast to be at zero, similar to the previous quarter. We expect the household loans to be strengthened by the government to manage household debt and by increasing the credit risk stemming from an increase in lending rates, the central bank explained. Small and midsize businesses are also expected to tighten their screening procedures for loans as they are scheduled to introduce private loan loans in March this year, the central bank added.Local banks ` outlook on lending attitude index by each customer rose 4 points to 23. This means that the higher the credit risk index, the greater the risk. By car, the outlook on household credit risk rose 10 points to 27 from the previous quarter. Small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) rose from 20 to 23. Small businesses were expected to increase their credit risk due to the possible rise in lending rates, sluggish performances from some of their large partners and rising lending rates. Large corporations remained at the same level as the previous quarter with 10. The forecast for the loan demand index fell 4 points to 2. It is the first time that the forecast of the loan demand index has dropped to negative since the second fiscal quarter of 2010. This was largely due to the drop in household mortgage loans from - 17 to - 27. The index is the lowest since 2002 when it was compiled. Meanwhile, non-bank financial institutions said, "" We will strengthen our lending attitude in all areas except for credit card companies. "" The index is forecast by mutual savings bank, mutual finance union - 39, and life insurance company - 7. The credit card company had 6 as of the previous quarter. Card firms are also expected to ease their lending attitude to compensate for the possible loss in profitability due to a rise in the procurement rate. Credit risk for borrowers was expected to increase altogether. It is predicted that the demand for loans will increase only at mutual savings banks (2) and credit card companies (19). The study targeted 199 financial institutions, including 15 local banks, 16 savings banks, eight credit card companies, 10 life insurers and 150 mutual financial associations, from Nov. 24-12. ▶ porque@yna.co.kr article 1:1 ▶ In the latest trends and report and your reporter Trump turning from hard-line stance ""can speak to him.""
