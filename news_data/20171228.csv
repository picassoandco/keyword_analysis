"" The store, which was closed since April in the aftermath of China's retaliation against the THAAD, has recently reopened itself with hopes of resuming U-CAR tours, including the Korea-China summit talks. Jeju's equivalent market, which is visited by many Chinese on October 23 at 12:00 p.m., is filled with Chinese, but empty of any store except for the store owners. The store was closed since April in the aftermath of China's retaliation against China's high-altitude missile defense (THAAD·Sad) system. Last month, the wholesale market was closed for the Jeju government. The store, which recently reopened, was closed for nine months in the aftermath of China's THAAD retaliation. Choi Choong-il, a reporter at China's Yuka- 遊 客, had been banned from selling group tourists to Korea on March 15. He could not do business for nine months. Baojian Street, the latest open section of Jeju City. Choi Choong-il, a reporter for Korea and China, was re-opened with excitement at the beginning of this month due to anticipation of the resumption of U-ker tours. However, it is as if China is being "" cheated "" again by Beijing's revised anti-car travel ban on Korean groups. "" We've had a wind in the past that Yukor is coming back to work, and I don't think the industry is going to have that kind of mood, so I really can't wait to see how it would turn out, "" said Kim (55), adding, "" If the new stock was in stock. The atmosphere in Jeju's streets of Baojian, where commercial sales have decreased by 70 percent since April, is also gloomy. It is generally quiet, except for the presence of some individual Chinese tourists with shopping bags from a large foreign duty-free shop. Baojian Street, the latest open section of Jeju City. Choi Choong-il, a journalist, said, "" Some reporters can't stop expecting things. We are not keeping an eye on the Chinese tourism market, said Chang Ji-bok, director of the inbound tourism agency, in a major disappointment over the suspension of this year`s group tours. Hyun-mo, 45, who mainly sells jewelry to Chinese employees, said, "" As sales have dropped by half since March, I have been able to keep my job available to China to improve from next spring. "" Chinese tourists who visited Jeju recently are walking on the streets of the Yeon-dong shopping mall in Jeju. Choi Choong-il, a journalist at Jeju Island, said, "" The unrest and expectations remain because China briefly blocked the group tours to Korea, which was resumed three weeks later, and notified each travel agency of them. Shandong Province, China, has reported regional travel agencies to Qingdao and Yantai as having met on Jan. 20, saying, "" Starting January 1 next year, travel agencies in China have banned all travel agencies from traveling to China. "" No deadline has been set for banning. ▽ Beijing Reserve Route = Since November 19, no group requests for approval have been granted from travel agencies. The Chinese government has banned all group tours to Korea since March 15, but partially released in Beijing and Shandong Province from March 28. However, it was less than a month before the U.S. decided to ban North Korea from doing so again. Korean tourists are having a good time in Jeju's Jeolmul Natural Recreation Forest. It is not easy to see Chinese people at major tourist attractions in Jeju Island recently. According to Jeju Island Monday, 11 group tourists who received a group visa visited Jeju Island via Incheon on July 19. The four people who visited Korea for five days and four nights traveled to Seoul from Jeju Island on July 19 and 20. Actually, this is where Yuker's Jeju tour ended. Amid growing anxiety over China, Jeju Island is trying to improve its image of the inbound (foreign travel) market mainly for Chinese tourists. The ministry will spend more than 42 billion won next year to diversify the tourism market and add individual tourists. It is determined to break away from the mainly Chinese tourism market. Japan, with great market potential, is conducting marketing activities in Tokyo and Osaka after making efforts to maintain its existing direct flights. Southeast Asian countries will develop products such as those that have direct flights to Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand to target metropolitan areas and provide diesel products. To improve low-price tourism and enhance the competitiveness of tourism businesses, the Commission also operated a joint guidance and control team. Korean tourists are having a good time in Jeju's Jeolmul Natural Recreation Forest. It is not easy to see Chinese people at major tourist attractions in Jeju Island recently. Jeju Island plans to focus more on attracting tourists from Japan or Southeast Asian countries to escape the Chinese-oriented tourism market. It is also making efforts to expand the Jeju MICE multipurpose complex project to host the international conference of journalist Choi Choong-il. In particular, the Jungmun Tourist Park, in which ICC JE JU (Jeju International Convention Center) is located, will be negotiated with the central government for the designation of the Jungmun Tourism Complex as an international conference complex. The Chinese and Taiwanese provinces plan to focus on individual tourists and medical treatment, rather than group tourists.

"The definition of the current, temperature, and quantity of water will be funded (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) = Unit of mass "" kg "" will be changed next year. According to the Korea Institute of Standards and Sciences on July 28, the 26th International Congress of Standards and Technology (CGPM) scheduled to hold a final decision on the issue of the ` kg Finance ` next November. The new definition of kg actually applies to industries and academia from May 20, 2019. The international standard of mass, which has been in effect since 1889, will change in 130 years. The international community has agreed to redefine the kilogram as a standard used so far. One kilogram is currently designated as a force. Energy is the term used to describe an object that is the standard for 1 kg. It is a cylindrical object with a height of 39 mm and a diameter of 10 % platinum and iridium. The object has been kept in a safe deposit box under the International Bureau of Standards (BIPM) near Paris in a glass tube.The mass of platinum and iridium (kg). [Korea Institute of Standards and Technology provided.] But no amount of reactive platinum can avoid changes over time. Over the course of a hundred years, the vigor has moved to react with the air and has changed its tiny mass due to foreign bodies. It is currently estimated that up to 100 ⑨ (microgram · 1 micro million) less than when first made. The international community has decided to define kilograms as a constant, rather than an object that could change anytime. One of the basic physical constants, the Planck constant, is to be used for the override of kg. Planck's is an quantum mechanical constant that explains the relationship between light energy and wavelength. Several researchers have already tested and presented a ' measurement ' of Planck's constant. In Korea, a team of researchers at the Korea Institute of Standards and Technology drew the constant with Kibble Scale, a device that compares physical and electrical energy. Although measurements vary little by little depending on the experiment, the international community has now defined Planck constants by summing these figures. "" So far kilograms have been defined based on the mass of manmade objects, but the new kg is now more stable than the constant Plank constant, which is a constant constant, "" explained Lee Gwang-chul, the economist at the institute. Next year's metrology will also use these constants in units of quantity of water (mol ; ampere), current (A·ampered), and temperature (K·Kelvin). Water will be used as an Avogadro number and electricity as a base charge. `` It is the first time that a metrological assembly has changed four definitions at a time, '' Lee said. `` I think the international system will become stronger by redefining based on physical constants. sun@yna.co.kr, a news briefing and a one-on-one chat with a reporter in Gangseo, Gyeonggi Province. As the roof of a bus has caved in, it is natural for the Korea Railroad to fall down at the construction site and get rid of the window-windowed debris. 911 rescue workers are busy in the process of rescue efforts. Kim Ki-hun, a reporter at Yonhap News Agency in Seoul, said, "" The local buses at the site of the accident were in terrible shape when a large crane structure collapsed on July 28. Boomwell, the crane's arm, struck the middle part of a bus that had been stopped in the central lane, leaving the top of the bus dented like a paper. The bus was littered with broken windows, and police stopped the bus from entering the area by setting up police lines around the scene. The accident occurred at 9:40 a.m. At the site of the demolition, a crane structure fell and hit a city bus. One passenger was killed and 15 in total were injured in the accident. The scene of the accident was being dismantled. Firefighters say the large crane fell on the fifth floor of the building, unable to withstand its weight while lifting it to the rooftop. After hitting the safety fence at the construction site, boom University bent like a taffy and hit the roof in the middle of the bus. A drilling machine that he was trying to transport by crane also crashed in the middle of the road. Earth and body debris were scattered around the excavator on the first lane of the Gimpo airport. The excavator could fall onto a bus or bus stop, causing massive loss of life.Korean Central News Agency reporter Hwang Gwang-mo (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) : A large crane fell down at a demolition site near Gangseo, Seoul, and a police officer ran into a bus yesterday morning. At the scene of the accident, which was not cleared up yet, citizens showed up and took pictures or whispered, "" What is this, in the morning? ""[Graphic] Kim (36), who witnessed the crane accident in Deungchon-dong, Seoul, said, I saw a "" bang "" on the road, and passengers were shocked when they saw the drill crashed and the crane collapsed. "" I was sitting in a nearby lottery room when I heard a loud noise, ' Woodjib Boom ', ' ' "" said store merchant Kim EuI-won. When she first saw the crane, she saw the accident. Citizens have complained of anxiety over a series of safety accidents. Kim Dong-seop (63), a citizen who was passing by on the scene, said, I don`t think it is safe for the public at construction sites, so I feel uneasy about these accidents. `` The safety fence at the construction site looks so sloppy, '' she said under the title of saying, `` Where in the world is this? '' The accident scene was heavily congested with delays in crane dismantling and handling. From Deungchon Station, about 300 meters of the entrance ramp for Gangseo-gu Office were blocked, and the other side repeatedly stood while using one of the lanes. However, it does not seem easy to deal with the accident. As the ground on the crane is sloped and weak, if we hurry to lift it, we may have a second accident, said a fire department official, adding, We plan to raise it after the ground is reinforced. Police are investigating the exact cause of the accident based on witness statements at the scene. Police will apply for professional negligence resulting from death if the site manager is found guilty.

"[MoneyToday Sejong = Yang Young-kwon Reporters][Foundation ' Special Measures to Fight Virtual Monetary Speculation……When the government's countermeasures fail, the government immediately stops the virtual account service on the virtual currency exchange. If the government does not follow the measures, it will exclude financial services and take strong measures to wash funds using virtual currency exchange. The government held a meeting of vice minister of general affairs at Seoul's Seoulcheong District Office to announce its special measures to combat virtual currency speculation. The government has decided to introduce a real-name policy for virtual currency transactions. A ' real name bank ' account has been checked to allow payments between an account in the same bank and the account in the virtual currency exchange and to be stopped using the current account type that is not currently available for verification. They say that the virtual bank accounts used for apartment management expenses, school tuition, and fines are being used as virtual currency transaction accounts to spread speculation and impair transparency in financial transactions. The financial community's new virtual account on the virtual currency exchange is immediately stopped. Existing virtual currency exchange plans to provide virtual accounts to new members will also be halted.In addition, the government will speed up the relocation of existing virtual account users to their accounts. The government said it will work with the Financial Information Agency and the Financial Supervisory Service to check the operation of the bank's real-name account system to guide banks to settle down as soon as possible. In addition, the government will ask banks to jointly check the operation of payment services on the virtual currency exchange. The government will exclude and remove financial services from the unhealthy exchanges that do not follow the government's emergency measures announced on July 13. Banks will have a stronger duty to avoid money laundering for virtual currency exchanges. Banks will be allowed to identify and manage the exchange specifically until the virtual currency exchange is confirmed by using its real name, and they will also be monitored more closely. If transactions occur frequently with minor or low-income people, or if the customer's cash is transferred to the virtual currency exchange after it has been credited to their own account, the virtual currency exchange is suspect. If the transactions on the virtual currency exchange are reported as suspicious, FTU will analyze them and provide the data to law enforcement agencies in case of an uncertain source of funds or suspected money laundering. Police and prosecutors are also more responsive to fraud under the pretext of selling virtual currency diggers and the Korea Customs Service is conducting an intensive inspection on China-related currency dealers. The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) is also planning to have operators voluntarily clean up their virtual currency online ads on portals. The Fair Trade Commission is reviewing whether to use unfair clauses based on the terms and conditions submitted by virtual currency exchanges. At the meeting, the Justice Ministry proposed establishing a special law to close the virtual currency exchange. We will take appropriate and timely action based on the situation while watching the future trend of virtual currencies and the extent of spreading speculation, Hong Nam-gi, head of the Office of Government Policy Coordination, said, including closing the main bourse. What you see next door is a free comic strip and a gift batter! Airports will allow you to check in at parking lots and curves sides (road in front of airport terminals). Biometric boarding procedures using fingerprints, iris and veins are expected to significantly reduce waiting times at airports as well as improve airline security.President's Council of the fourth round of the Industrial Revolution is the third meeting on 28 and such deliberations on the content of the 'smart airport master plan'. The main objective is to improve the overall operation of the airport and the entire travel route for passengers by combining the fourth industry technology with all airports nationwide. First, measures are implemented to increase the usage of check in of web and mobile. Web·mobile check-in is a feature that enables you to check in an airline ticket from your mobile phone anytime, anywhere. As of 2016, only 6.8 % of all passengers can be used, although it is convenient to use it, not many airlines handle it. The government is considering promoting the plan to increase the number of airline companies that offer Web and mobile check-in services from the current 35 to 70 by 2022, among the 88 airlines operating at Incheon International Airport. Air & Rail ; system will also be developed and operated for a variety of airlines.The central airport terminal will also be activated. City Airport Terminal is not an airport but an airport terminal that allows travelers to check out of the city areas such as train stations. It is currently operating in two stations in Samseong-dong and Seoul, and the KTX Gwangmyung Station City Airport terminal will open in January next year. The government plans to encourage additional airline businesses to move into the downtown airport terminal with financial support to provide more facilities.In 2019, a service to transport baggage from the local KTX station to Incheon Airport will be introduced. The baggage claim is sent to the downtown airport terminal at Gwangmyeong Station and then shipped to Incheon Airport from here via the Self-Back Drop Counter.Incheon International Airport will allow passengers to check in at parking lots and curves sides besides terminals starting from 2023. Parallel checkpoints, in which three to five people can receive searches simultaneously, will be introduced next year to shorten search time.From next year, Gimpo Airport, Jeju Airport and Gimhae Airport will be able to replace their IDs with fingerprints when using domestic flights. In 2019, it is planned to introduce a system that automatically checks the airline ticket reservation information with bioinformatics.Airports operations are also effectively changed using smart technologies. A system for predicting passenger flow based on big data (large-scale information analysis technologies) will be built sequentially beginning next year. Airport facilities are equipped with IoT network to identify and manage failures in real-time. Smart CCTV, which automatically detects suspicious activity, is also introduced.To enhance the satisfaction level of airport use, VR experience will also be established. It was first installed at Gimpo Airport in 2019 and expanded to Gimhae Airport and Jeju Airport in 2020. Smart land stores that experience products with VR and pay for purchases with mobile phones plan to increase gradually from Jeju Airport in 2019.Robots, drones (unmanned vehicle owners) and autonomous roads are utilized at smart airports. The drones will be tested starting next year for airport navigation facility inspections, outside security, and bird control. Additional guiding robots are placed in the departure and arrival areas in addition to the guidance and cleaning robots currently introduced at Incheon Airport. Self-driving shuttle between Incheon International Airport's terminal 2 and its conductor, Jang Ki-ju, is also scheduled to be introduced in the second half of next year.The government plans to develop the model and introduce a certification system to export the plane abroad. The revision of the Aviation Business Act also provides legal grounds to support overseas marketing and consulting at smart airports.To carry out the smart airport plan, a budget of 395 billion won will be invested over the next five years, including 107.7 billion won from Research and Development in the Ministry of Land, Gaepae Airport Corporation 119.6 billion won from Incheon Airport Corporation and 167.5 billion won from the Korea Airports Corporation.With the smart airport drive, we expect to see a 17 percent reduction in departure procedures, save 200 billion won per year in additional airport costs and create 6320 new jobs, said an official at the ministry.What you see next door is a free comic strip and a gift batter! ▶ Cheerleader vs. racing girl reporter Kim Sa-muel samuel@mt.co.kr< Author of the rights group ⓒ ' Real Time News with Money ', No Trafficking or Redistribution >"

Judge Oh Min-seok of the Seoul Central District Court said early this morning, "" We have raised the possibility of disputes over criminal charges, such as bribes received, and we can not afford to ignore the evidence of the prosecution and other charges. "" After the court interrogated the suspect before the arrest, Cho was released from Seoul Detention Center immediately after the court decided to hold the warrant. Former Chief of the Korean Sports and Tourism Ministry was acquitted in July 27 on charges of setting up and managing the ` cultural and artistic aid exclusion list ` during an investigation by special prosecutor, Park Young-soo. However, National Intelligence Service investigation of the prosecution, which began after his Park Geun-hye in government as Lee's chief political aide had received the Special Programs National Intelligence Service fee of about 50 million won for five million won per month.(bribing the Additional Punishment Law on Specific Crimes) is new allegations and Seoul Central District Public Prosecutors ' Office Special Part 3 (yangseokjjo a chief public prosecutor.) is 22, sought an arrest warrant. The prosecution is also accused of abusing its authority to force former presidential secretary Huh Hyun-jun to provide billions of won to conservative groups that staged controlled protests against the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI). Prosecutors strongly argued for the need to secure former chief of staff Cho's arrest during a process of 4 hours and 20 minutes starting at 10:30 a.m. yesterday, but the court concluded it would be advisable to investigate him without physical detention. Right after the court decision, the prosecution strongly protested, saying, It is hard to accept the reason for the dismissal. The prosecution argued that former administration official Huh was arrested on the same charge of pressuring the Federation of Korean Industries to support certain conservative groups, whereas former head of the Federation of Korean Industries Chief Executive Officers, who was found to be in charge of corruption, avoided paying bribes. The prosecution has well acknowledged that Cho received large sums of money from the NIS chief and is also fully justified in its involvement in supporting certain conservative groups, including statements by Cheong Wa Dae officials and subordinate officials. Considering the progress of the false testimony of those involved, including former presidential secretary for political affairs Park Joon-woo, there is also a high possibility of destruction of evidence in the trial, refuting the reasons for the dismissal one by one. Prosecutors, who are on the verge of finishing legal proceedings by special agents of the NIS, will review the purpose of the court's dismissal of the warrant before deciding whether to investigate further or appeal. banghd@yna.co.kr was involved in a 1:1 chat with a reporter on July 28 when four of the 16 passengers on the latest trend bus were transferred to hospitals. 911 rescue workers are busy in the process of rescue efforts.

A lawsuit has been filed against what is called the "" battery gate "" by the iPhone system, calling for damages larger than Apple's market capitalization (approximately $ 88 billion). U.S. IT media < Phone Arena > announced on July 27 (local time) that iPhone user Violetta Millian of the U.S. sued Apple for approximately $ 999.9 billion in federal court in California. That is why Apple software updates have deliberately reduced the performance of legacy models such as the iPhone 6·iPhone 6Gb/s and the iPhone SE to inform consumers of this. Violeta said, Apple slowed down the iPhone, encouraging older iPhone users to buy new phones instead of repairing their products. Users argued that this was a scam because it was difficult to determine if Apple was meant to do so, and they argued that it was a violation of the California Business and Professional Law. In the United States, nine lawsuits have been filed against battery gates. There is also a move to file a class action suit in Korea. Whimyung Corporation, a law firm, announced on July 27 that it would file a suit against Apple Korea for damages. So far, around 20 users have participated, and claims for damages are said to range from 500,000 to 1 million won per person. Han Noo-ri, a law firm, is also planning to recruit litigants and file class action lawsuits against Apple headquarters and Apple Korea starting July 28. HannurI said, "" Apple's actions are not just a form of immoral lawsuits, as they are designed to cover up battery faults, induce the repurchase of the new iPhone instead of the battery exchange. "" As the process continues, the U.S. courts will file a lawsuit against Apple, participate in a class action suit filed against Apple, or seek collective settlement through a consumer group. "" Earlier, Apple said on July 20 that "" Lithium-ion batteries could have been switched off suddenly due to their low ambient temperatures, their low state of charge, or their aging state, so they could have to turn off their power to protect the device.

And I divided the group talking about jobs into Δ job seekers (readers) Δ career disconnectors (retiressmen) Δ career disconnectors (working women) Δ employees (dismissals) and Δ employees ' mothers (working mothers). The ministry said that although the analysis shows that the 20s and 30s are pursuing a vague fashion, it is clear and able to say, ' Interest ' in a generation that can be considered carefully and judged wisely and put into action.

The groups most wanted flexible working hours were the working mothers and the women with career breaks. And highly educated and high-school women complained of difficulty in finding a new job due to a break in careers due to marriage, childbirth and childcare.People in their 20s and 30s were less likely to have jobs that fit their "" personal aptitude.

It was the ongoing progressive agony of the time, with the career being recognized and earnest seeking advice to move to a better job. They called the three-year term "" career "" puberty and regarded it as the time when conflicts over whether to move up in the company or move out of the company were at their highest.

It is designed to accelerate the reform of the defense industry by comprehensively reviewing trends in scientific technology development during the 4th Industrial Revolution era and forecast of possible weapons systems in the future. Among the new concept weapons were the clear stealth tanks equipped with metamate-based optical, infrared clear cloak technology. The transparent stealth tanks could avoid the enemy's radar and infrared lines, and are invisible to the naked eye, which will greatly contribute to gaining the upper hand in the international battle, the agency predicted. Among the new concept weapons proposed by the Defense Ministry is a ' sea squirt ' that can be operated underwater at high speed. Combined with the electric propulsion system and the sea-absorbing rocket engine, the submersible gains momentum with an electric propeller in the peacetime but converts to a rocket-engineered engine when it needs a high-speed maneuver. Sea water acts as an oxidizer to increase the efficiency of rocket engines.The concept map of a sea-absorbing submersible called ' MultI-Specific Unseen Armor ' employs several micro-underwater-size unmanned aircraft with sensors, such as radars, to cluster detection with no regular radar. In addition, the agency has developed an artificial satellite with ion rocket engine technology, an intelligent multitane missile that disables multiple targets with a single missile, and an unmanned charger for the development of solar energy at high altitude. AI Cyber Command Control System, detection system of enemy provocations, and war game system that reflect trends in AI technologies were also included. The new concept weapons systems were published in a book by the Agency for Defense Development along with 63 futuristic defense technologies, called Future Defense Technology linked to the fourth industrial revolution.

"" The committee not only dealt with the incident, but also launched the Cheonan, the North Korean warship, in 2010. Unification policies should be made consistently based on the law, not swayed by political factionalization, he said. To that end, the committee should establish a judicial and administrative committee within the Unification Ministry and establish a task force and a working committee for unification policies. The committee also raised questions about the ministry's public announcement last April of the mass defection of female workers from North Korea's restaurants in China and the defection of Tae-Young-ho, a former North Korean minister. In particular, the group announced the elections at a sensitive time only four days before the elections, the committee stressed, We should prohibit the political use of North Korea`s information. However, it was not clear whether the announcement was made based on actual political intentions. Regarding the inter-Korean talks, the Unification Ministry should closely consult with related agencies, saying, As the talks went ahead between the South Korean National Security Agency and the North Korean National Defense Commission, the inter-Korean talks management system has weakened. The two Koreas also failed to reach an appropriate point in their talks on whether inter-Korean working-level talks broke down due to the level of their chief negotiator in June 2013, although it was not the right time to reach an agreement on the two Koreas ` relationship. In addition, the committee asked for efforts to improve the exchange cooperation law and the North Korean residents ' contact reporting system, saying, "" Private exchange cooperation has been completely controlled and the basis for cooperation has been weakened. "" We should establish our direction with a unified education that seeks to bring peace and common prosperity.

"Special Measures for Virtual Counterparties (PG) [Production and Marketing Committee)], follow-up measures by the government, and payment halt (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) immediately asked the government to suspend payment (Seoul) to provide virtual currency. A prescription for unhealthy virtual currency handlers (exchange) to stop payment and payment services was also issued. It will also consider setting a per capita limit if necessary. The Financial Services Commission held a meeting on the virtual money-related financial institutions and commercial bank officials at the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) presided over by Kim Yong-beom on July 28, and followed up its actions against the government. The government announced a special measures for virtual currencies yesterday morning. The Financial Services Commission was originally designed to provide efficiency for collection purposes, such as apartment management costs or university tuition, by requesting that the Bank's virtual account services be substantially requested to confirm the transaction accounts of the virtual currency transactions and by requesting that they be substantially checked and sent as a transit account. Kim Yong-beom, vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission at the virtual currency verification meeting, [provided with the Financial Supervisory Commission] Virtual accounts are used by businesses that need large sums of funds or transfers to identify customers. As individual virtual accounts are issued and controlled by businesses rather than banks, their real names can not be checked as they are by normal bank accounts. To solve the problem, the Financial Supervisory Commission demanded that the virtual account service stop immediately from being provided to virtual currency dealers. Banks currently providing virtual account services to virtual currency traders asked not to add new members to their virtual accounts anymore. Banks are required to develop a real-name verification system as soon as possible and transfer the current virtual account service users to the system. ▽ Government, Virtual Currency Exchange Real Name System … Special Law Review (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) = The government announced on July 28 that it would introduce a special measure to combat virtual currency speculation and also make it clear that it would do so. The photo shows the Bitsum exchange in Seoul. ryousanta@yna.co.kr That means the bank finally allowed the bank to pay more in virtual transactions between itself and the same bank account in virtual currency exchange in September. The bank also requested that the payment services of virtual currency dealers be thoroughly checked. As a result of inspection, it requested that businesses handling unhealthy virtual currency, such as checking their own identities or banning minors or foreigners, take steps to stop payment services. The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) and the bank jointly formed a task force to minimize confusion in the early stage of implementation and requested that follow-up measures be made thoroughly.The Financial Information Analysis Service (FIU) and the FSS requested that the Korea Virtual Monetary Institute (FIU) prepare a policy guideline to prevent money laundering for commercial bank accounts. If the current virtual account service of a financial company is restricted, it is judged that the virtual currency handler can switch to general corporation account. The government will prepare guidelines to prevent money laundering related to virtual currencies during January next year. The guidelines will assess the risks of money laundering associated with virtual currencies, establish a process to identify dealers, and faithfully report suspicious transactions, such as large numbers and large transactions. After the real-name system is in place, the companies will consider setting a limit on transactions per capita if necessary. The measure is expected to pave the way for future taxing virtual currency transactions by enhancing the bank`s control of the accounts of virtual currency traders and dealers and enhancing the basis for monitoring suspicious transactions and the prevention of illegal money laundering, Kim Yong-beom said. speed@yna.co.kr Because one tries to conceal the truth, and another tries to disclose. It is a statement concerning the "" Miss Ko Joon-hee (5) "" incident that took place in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province.Police have already narrowed down the dragnet that shows high possibility of missing by crime. Even if one believes her family's argument, the 5-year-old Jun-hee went missing on July 28. Ko Joon-hee (5), a missing woman who was attached to a studio. Kim Joon-hee, a journalist, had stayed at another house, not her parents ' since April. She lived alone with her aunt Kim (61), the mother of her husband's 36-year-old aunt. However, no CCTV or eyewitness has emerged to determine Jun-hee's behavior. Police said they saw the child care teacher's statement on March 30, regarding the final objective data on the child home, and have re-calculated the maximum number of missing days since April. Amid this growing skepticism, the photo inside the missing leaflet that search for Jun-hee is becoming suspicious. Police recently stated, "" Jun-hee had her forehead torn and her head torn off on February 23 and March 19, so she had no suture surgery at a hospital in Jeonju. "" But her scar on the photo showed Jun-hee's forehead. A wound to her forehead on a toilet paper towel was made by her, and her head was ripped when she was playing under the desk and hit an item, Ko said to police. Police are searching the area of Kirinbong in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, for the missing woman, Ko Joon-hee (5). Kim and her father, who both claim to have taken care of her until just before she disappeared, have not photographed the baby since March, so the photo is the latest of her. The two photos on the missing leaflet show that Lee submitted to police the photo of Jun-hee with her smartphone in February or March. According to police, Ko's father and Lee's mother changed all their cell phones at the same dealership in Jeonju on October 31 and October 14 before reporting their disappearance. Police said, We have transferred the data, including her photos of Jun-hee from her old cell phone, to her new phone, but we don`t know the exact date of the shoot. A villa in Ua-dong, Jeonju, is believed to have lived before Ko Joon-hee's disappearance. Correspondent Kim Joon-hee happens to have her picture taken in February or March, when she was injured by what is called a wound. It was when Jun-hee lived with Koh's mistress Lee and Lee's son (6) in her father's apartment in Bongdong-eup, Wanju-gun, North Jeolla Province. However, it is hard to find any scar on her face from a leaflet. That is why I wonder if Lee actually took her in February or March. Regarding this, investigator Kim Young-keun of Jeonju Deokjin Police Station, who is investigating the incident, said, "" I didn't know how many stitches were in the open wound so it wasn't small. "" But first, "" The children had a quick head injury and a quick forehead. "" Firefighters searched for Ko Joon-hee (5) in a rubber boat at Ajung Reservoir in central Seoul Thursday. Regarding the suspicion that he was being "" abused, "" Kim said, I interviewed a doctor who operated on her three or four times, but I don`t know whether she was hurt by violence or abuse, or whether she was hurt by abuse. Still, he added, It is not to the effect that we can not say it is abuse, not abuse. As the disappearance period is prolonged, people are less likely to survive. Jun-hee, who was born prematurely six months and suffers from hypothyroidism, has had no thyroid disease or has had her thyroid gland disorder checked since January. Prior to this, when Ko and her mother were being sued by two elementary school brothers for divorce and took care of Jun-hee, they received thyroid and rehabilitation treatments at Jeonbuk University Hospital for two years. A policeman puts a leaflet on Ko Joon-hee in front of a studio. Hydroclia Profile Kim Joon-hee is a condition in which thyroid hormone levels drop or lack of function in the body due to poor thyroid hormone production. The thyroid hormone plays a role in maintaining a balance between body temperature and metabolism. Degradation of congenital thyroid in children causes mental retardation and short height. Experts say, "" Children with hypothyroidism usually fail to take drugs that control thyroid hormone, they may not be able to take such lethargy, such as an intellectual loss or a decline in physical function, for one year. "" Regarding this, the police said, I checked with my mother, but I said, ' If I don't get thyroid treatment right now, I won't be wrong. ' And I haven't confirmed through my doctor.

Another agency rejected the evaluation results of the top scorer who received the highest scores in open recruitment this year. As a result, the second-place scorer was the last to be passed. The Ministry of Public Administration and Security announced on July 28 that 475 organizations have caught 1,466 cases of recruitment irregularities as a result of a recent five-year checkup by local public agencies starting last month. 659 which established a special task force for local public agencies on July 1 and excluded institutions that have not been hired since 2013 among all 824 local public institutions. The Ministry of Public Administration and Security requested an investigation into 24 cases that require tracking by the local police because of the suspicion of recruitment irregularities, and requested a separate cancellation if found to be true. The ministry also imposed disciplinary measures against 102 cases involving corruption, requests, and forgery of documents, including those of personnel. Attention (566), improvement and recommendation (784) was taken when supplementary matters, such as deficiency in recruitment procedures or lack of regulations, were required. Out of 36 cases that the Employment Corruption Reporting Center (Employment Service) received, 8 cases were requested to be investigated, and 4 cases were disciplined and reprimanded. If the applicants were classified by type of corruption, the number of recruitment violation cases (employment violation cases) most used for recruitment was 294, because they did not excessively limit the qualification requirements set by the Act or clearly specify the number of applicants, procedures or points allocated. The requirements for inadequate committee composition, including stakeholders (216), inadequate regulations (164 cases), and inadequate assessment criteria for change in employment (125 cases), and inadequate assessment criteria for applicants were processed. In 2015, a local public institution hired a contract worker, and the head of the personnel department hired his nephew to take the exam, but he did so. As a result, the nephew was given the privilege of switching to a full-time position one year later. Last year, other local public agencies hired the son of a certain person who had close ties with the head of the agency without an open competition test as a prospective candidate. The Ministry of Public Administration and Security requested that provincial authorities reprimand local authorities for irregularities in hiring and follow up on measures to deal with them according to their intentional (middle) faults and their wishes. The Act and the System Improvement Plan were also prepared to eliminate recruitment irregularities during the first half of next year. The Act, the Act on Investment and Contributions of Local Public Enterprises, and the Act was revised to strengthen the punishment criteria, control, and supervision of non-employees, and ‘ Personnel, Employment Service Processing Guideline ’ (tentative name) established for each testing committee or assessment criteria.

"Jangjeguk (the left) milkyspotted sole president, former lawmaker Ahn Dae-hee, former Supreme Court (among) ; and Hong Jung-wook, Ahn Dae-hee, hongjeongukjjang Empire [Associated Press file photo] declaration not to run in next year … one local election strategy.Unavoidable delay Korea ""strategic silpaeji talent not a failure"" Hong Joon-pyo, chairman of the talent in … ""recruiting from now on,"" (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) ianseung the press.Korea's local elections free : talent decoy plan is beginning away. Former Busan Mayor Hong Jung-wook, who was nominated as the candidate for the presidency of Dongseo University in Busan and former Supreme Court justice Ahn Dae-hee, also turned down to run. Hong said on his Facebook page on July 28, I will try harder to shed light on the world and change it in my present position, rather than to pretend to answer the call immediately. He made it clear that he has no intention of running for Seoul mayor under the current circumstances. The election will deal a serious blow to the election of Seoul mayor, the most fierce battleground of the election, and Busan mayor, the frontline of the Nakdonggang River. Ahn is also mentioned as a candidate for the governor of South Gyeongsang Province, but it is questionable whether he will accept the governor's card since he has refused to run for Busan mayor. Most importantly, these regions are the main points of contention that can determine the local electoral structure, and if it fails to find the right people, the Korea Party may have to revise its overall campaign strategy. Some analyze that the delayed recovery of the party's approval rating is adversely affecting future recruitment of additional talent as the number of people who did not run for office continues to drop out. Separately, the Korea Party has Choi Joong-kyung, former Knowledge Economy Minister, as its candidate for the race, but Choe`s intentions have yet to be confirmed.However, the party is in a different position. The recent string of non-election by candidates for heads of local governments shows that it is a strategic failure, not a failure to recruit talented people. The Korea Party has decided that the reporting of the names of the candidates in the media while the recruitment process is pending is a major strategic failure. With only six months left until the local elections and the party's approval rating has not risen, the real names of candidates were mentioned too hurriedly, and therefore, they could not have made many choices. Leader Hong Joon-pyo, too, talent of the party through the media operation is reported specifically for staff reportedly strongly as a rebuke. Most importantly, Hong is encouraged to head the national team's own recruitment committee. As the party chairman himself is set to step up and hire talented people, he is expected to speed up the recruitment of "" Pilsung. "" Hong said, "" As the party is in a difficult situation, I will directly lead the recruitment committee. "" In addition, if a third party serves as the head of a human resource recruitment committee, the appointment can be eliminated in the process of screening process, but when a representative hires someone who picks up a candidate in person, it can guarantee the nomination process. The government has not even begun to start recruiting yet. We expect to see more activity in recruiting human resources as the CEO himself heads the recruitment committee from now on. jesus7864@yna.co.kr and online information on Monday. The ministry has signed a business agreement with the Korea Transportation Safety Authority and the National Association of Automobile Inspection and Maintenance and Inspection to expand the recall information for car inspections to rectify more vehicle defects targeted. Two vehicles - Hyundai Sonata (NF) and Grander (TG) - were provided with an electronic device to regulate brakes and engine power to prevent the car from sliding, and a confirmation of the possibility of a short circuit fire (ABVDC module). 7,000 787 BMW 32 d and 2,095 Chrysler 300 C (LE) units were at risk of causing injury to drivers of metal chips due to the excessive explosion pressure of inflators. 4,459 cars with six models including Jaguar and XF have reported a malfunction in the instrument panel due to a software failure. The company will recall two of its 195 Venteen`s models, including the Mercedes-Benz AMG C363. It is possible that 186 cars of five models, such as the Benz AMG C33, could not be controlled by the engine while the rear wheels are spinning, accelerating rapidly on wet roads due to an electronic stability function (ESP) program error. Nine of the seven models, including the Mercedes-Benz S50 Blue Tech, are known to have turned off their seat belt pretensioners by rapidly pulling their seatbelts to the bodies of passengers in case of an accident. 931 Cormett 650 motorcycle cars have faulty clutch covers that could lead to engine oil leaks, and if the leaked engine oil is applied to the rear wheels, the danger of an accident was noted. The manufacturers and sellers will notify car owners of corrections, including via mail and cell phone text messages. Car owners who have repaired the defect at their own expense before the recall is performed may ask the manufacturer for compensation. Other questions are : Hyundai Motor (☎ ☎ ☎300-600-06000), BMW Korea (080-269-2200), and Essie-CARRO Korea (080-850-240). The Ministry of Land and Infrastructure operates an automatic car call center (www.car.go.crt, ☎080-375-25005) to collect and analyze car manufacturing defect information. If you enter your vehicle number on the home page, you can check whether your car is eligible for recall or not and whether specific build flaws are found in the car company's retirement age of 89. It is a drastic measure by adding 15 years to the existing retirement age of 65. First of all, they can hire anyone who wants to work more after they retire at the age of 65. These senior staff are responsible for operations, general affairs, and other non-driving duties. NHK reported on July 27 that small and medium businesses across Japan are experiencing a high level of influence over the elderly. Companies reach out to the elderly because of the severe shortage of workers. Japan's effective recruitment rate last month stood at 1.56 times the highest since January 1974. If the effective recruitment rate is 1.56 times higher, the number of job seekers is 156, whereas the number of job seekers is only 100. Large companies are relatively small, but small and mid-sized companies are in dire need of politicians. Goken Industrial Company, located in Iwata, Shizuoka Prefecture, has 76 employees (28.1 percent) over the age of 65. The oldest employee is currently 89 years old, and received a 72-year-old man as a new employee this April. The company ran a newspaper advertisement 30 years ago, saying it is hiring healthy grandparents because it lacks hands even when the economy is overheated. There are many Japanese seniors who want to continue working after they turn 65. In September, 52 percent of respondents said they would like to work from 70 to 79, according to a survey by the Korea Trust Bank, which surveyed 1111 workers aged over 60. Eleven percent of the respondents answered, Over 80. A 72-year-old man who joined the Gocken Industrial Company decided to resign from his previous job and found a job while still wanting to work. He is now in charge of a final check on the pre-shipment products. Reflecting this trend, some companies have even put forward an "" ageless retirement age, "" which has completely eliminated the retirement age.Senior who is on active duty and starts to look for work is called "" New Active. "" If the experience and expertise of Shin Hyun is right for the company's specific needs, the results will be optimal. VeorI Corporation, a car parts seller in Shinagawa, Tokyo, has been having a difficult time getting Italian auto parts, so it hired an experienced conglomerate. A 68 year old man who had worked at an Italian airline for 38 years was hired as an executive who used his Roman experience and local network to secure parts procurement. Shin Hyun also needs flexibility. It is not good to be so stiff as to say, "" This is what I used to be. "" A former employee of a large company that Gocken Industries hired left the company after being arrogant and conflicted with the local community over the situation at small and mid-sized companies. NHK stressed that it benefits everyone involved, not just itself, that the elderly would continue to perform in society at the age of 100. Small businesses can ease labor shortages and the local economy can become brisk due to the elderly.

The iPhone Fandom is the key driver that Apple has kept in the mobile market for the past decade.◇ iPhone gate that Apple submitted to file = Worldwide expansion indications = Major foreign media and related industries say Apple intentionally admitted to a reduction in iPhone performance, and then decided to file a lawsuit against Apple shortly after it was filed against Apple Eight local lawsuits have been identified so far ; an iPhone user in California has filed a suit demanding $ 999 billion (approximately 1071 trillion won) in damages. Israel has also filed a suit demanding $ 125 million in damages, accusing Apple of violating consumer protection laws. Korean law firms such as Huimyung and HannurI are expected to send out a string of lawsuits to recruit lawyers. The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) is also looking into Apple Korea to find out what it really is.Apple has been trying to slow down its iPhone's operations since December last year, with iPhone operating system updates ranging from iOS 10.2.1 to iOS 11.2.1. It was certainly not clear that it did not receive prior consumer consent. Apple, which had remained mum about related suspicions, belatedly admitted that when IT media Gebbench, a test result that demonstrated its poor performance, showed that it had failed. Apple explained that it was a move to deal with the sudden loss of power in some older phones, 6- 6S models, but it has since damaged consumer confidence.◇ Fears of breaking out of the fandom = Unavoidable damages to the image of the company and trust = Apart from the legal liability of Apple and the amount of damages compensation of Apple will deal a serious blow to Apple's image. Criticism is growing rapidly, with domestic IT media reporting negative reviews of Apple.Apple's biggest concern is the fandom. The iPhone Pandum, called Appl ppa and Appendum, has helped Apple grow to become the world`s largest company by purchasing the company`s products over the past decade. Apple was able to refuse FBI's request to unlock its iPhone in late 2015 because of strong support and solidarity among the fandom. There has been concern that Apple's founder Steve Jobs is small and has since been losing innovation, but the crisis has been easily quieted by the firm's global presence. Fandom, who loved Apple and Steve Jobs passionately, was the basis for Apple to build its brand value independently.However, with the revelation that Apple apparently cheated consumers, such cracks are also being detected in the fence. IPhone geeks were also criticized for their smoke and mirrors to encourage the purchase of iPhones 8 and iPhones (Ten), which were released this year. ◇ Apple's consumer deception, sluggish sales of the iPhone X, aren't it?= For the safety of electronic products, the electronic industry may have some performance impact updates. Samsung Electronics, for example, made a forced update to limit the battery charge rate in order last year when the battery exploded in Galaxy Note 7 ; But Apple, unlike Samsung, which not only sent out notices to its users at the time but also publicly announced the fact, has admitted to external requests while hiding the intentional deterioration. Apple, which was intoxicated with the "" throne "" made by its users, finally brought on its own anger with arrogance and self-righteousness.The ambitious ' iPhone X ' performance by Apple to celebrate its 10th anniversary is also casting a dark cloud over. Major financial investment companies have recently lowered their predictions for the iPhone X sales. Sinolink Securities, China, lowered its forecast for the iPhone's shipments to 35 million units in the first quarter of next year, 10 million less than before. U.S. research firm JL Warren Capital predicted that sales of the iPhone X will fall to 25 million units in the first quarter of next year from 30 million units in the fourth quarter of this year based on parts supply orders from vendors."" The confrontation between Apple and iPhone users in courts around the world will have led to a huge corporate impact, "" industry watchers say, "" in reality, if there is a large-scale fandom shift, the mobile market itself could be reversed.

"The Nature Watcher of Animal Yoon-Soon-young takes away the injured fish that the water bird missed, and it is a struggle to survive. It is a charismatic winter bird of prey. Though the severe cold spell is heating up in December, the Chamsuri couple visited Paldang in Gyeonggi-do again this year. It has already been 16 years. The young Chamsuri is now a family of four. The number of families is not expected to increase, so it is believed that they did not reproduce this year.A child of two years ' standing A child of three years ' standing Her waist, thighs, and tail feathers turned white. Two years later, when the flap becomes white, it will have adult feathers. The ages of the Chamsuri cubs are estimated to be five, three, and two. The mother is called ' Wangbal ' because of her thick legs. The father loosere is somewhat smaller than his mother, has white waist, and dark brown spots on its thighs. They decided to call it the tabby. Differing the Chamsuri family by these characteristics, the young are monitoring changes in the moulting process according to the year of birth, and examining their characteristics. A true basket of five years ' worth Female elephant, female king (left) and male spotted. Female elephants are bigger. The Chamsuri family emphasizes personal activities and sleeps with them. Uncomplimentary for invasion of the area of activity, such as a cool competition for prey. When an intruder appears in his hunting grounds, sound a warning to let him know he is. Family members are allowed to break in, but not in principle. On the other hand, sometimes they show family affection to protect each other's food, and they also cooperate, attack and defend each other. Often, baby champs take away the mother's food with a vengeance. At this time, the mother is aggressive, but appears to be an act of discipline. They may learn the necessary ways to live in the wild, where they can live in the wild. This is my idea to the end. It is wary that it would be unreasonable to judge nature based on people. Whole view of the Chamsuri Paldang Other biories always swallow their prey in full rush before rushing to it. The whitefish and white-tailed fish are caught by the cormorant or the cormorant when they float on fish or water that has not been swallowed because they are too big. As the king of the game is well aware of these things, the biorI hunt in groups, sits down at the designated tree and grabs the fish once or twice a day. The Chamsuri is seen through the four kilometers of everything. The king of the game flies at the game. Hunting also patiently decided so rarely made mistakes. The equivocation of the shamsuri is incredible. It is almost like a spirit to snatch a game from a distance of more than two kilometers at once. Wait calmly to catch fish, and hunt mallard, white-haired duck, white-headed duck, white-lipped duck, and grebe. Some birds visit Paldang, where wild animals in danger of becoming extinct. It appears that the king's pet peeve does not consider biorI a prey. It appears to be because they know that they provide food. BiorI rarely gets surprised or run away when a shamsuri walks by. However, if you look at white-tailed fish, you should avoid watching out or sitting down. The king of the game waits for prey and plummets with a sudden dive. The white-tailed hawk flies low over the water, watching for prey and hunting. The white-tailed hawk often floats down the mat for food and reveals its presence. Maybe it is because of its hasty predation. Patience, concentration, accuracy, and prudence are often observed as a failure to hunt, often lacking in realty. The sea squirt or white-tailed eagle has many loopholes in hunting and grabbing its prey. When attacked by a person who was caught in the cross, he or she dropped his food like a fish out of a net. They are then taking away the lost game. It is safest to quickly evacuate the game into the forest and dispose of it. It is because it is difficult to fight with a tree branch because of its big wings, and it can cause fatal injury to a branch. However, if it is not possible to avoid the forest, the last defense means to sit on a nearby rock, grab your food and defend yourself against the enemies. The white-tailed eagle and the king's prey fight started and sat on the rocks because it did not have time to catch game and go into the forest. Because white-tailed eagles were looking for food. The white-tailed eagle has trailed on. Another white-tailed eagle appeared. Three white-tailed fish go in for the king's food. White-tailed eagle However, the real treat is not an easy opponent. The king's legs spread their wings to protect them. A white-eye hawk is after, but it is eating its food in a hurry. Hide the food by covering it with wings. But the white-tailed eagle begins its attack to steal the prey of the bluefish. The white-tailed eagle hottered on the back of the shellfish. As the seabird started to blow, a white-tailed eagle grabbed onto its wings. The shellfish can not spread its wings and is forced to sink under the weight of a white-tailed sea hawk. A perfect hunter A true swimmer who tries to swim up a rock It is a day of humiliation. It is the first time that a king swimmer swims. I managed to climb the rock. The white-tailed hawk's persistent attempt to rob its prey continues. I can't stand it anymore. The king is on the offensive. The king of the sea legs is leaving with a prey. The winter at Paldang is cold. It is not only the cold winds that rush over the blue rivers. The struggle to survive is also biting wind. At Paldang, in winter, white-tailed eagle flies to fight with the king for food with the king. Maybe it is because it is easier to catch them directly. The tawny is more aggressive than the white-tailed eagle to steal a person's food. However, although the king and the king do not fight for food by keeping the gold medal, the white-tailed sea eagles have fiercely fought for food themselves. Interjection is not bad enough. Man's eye can judge by good and evil, but in nature, it is the order of life. Chamsu-ri hunts mostly at the Paldang Dam and the Misa Bridge section, and feeds around 24km of Gyeongancheon River, JeongjI-ri, Toechon-myeon, Gwangju, including the Daegyo-myeon.

"Eating onions and oranges, as well as apples, has shown that you can stop blood clots in the veins. This is because the flavonoid's procedures in these fruits and vegetables contain blood clots.Researchers at Harvard University's School of Medicine in the U.S. examined a compound that blocked the action of sulfide isomerase (PDI), a protein that produces blood clots in the blood vessels. Tests with more than 5,000 compounds showed that the flavone-based routines worked best."" Tests on mice showed that the routine was the strongest anti-thrombotic substance, "" the researchers said. Flavonoids are often found in vegetables and fruits, especially oranges and onions, berries, and buckwheat.Previous studies have also shown that diet rich in flavanoids, such as routine, reduces the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. The results of this study, the Journal of Clinical Investigation, publishedThrombopathy can occur in both arteries and veins, most often in emergencies. In the event of myocardial infarction, stroke, and lung thrombosis, an immediate treatment can cause death ; and in the case of acute peripheral arterial occlusion, necrosis can occur that can be cut and cut rapidly.On the other hand, venous thrombosis is not more likely to be an emergency than an arterial thrombosis, but prompt treatment is needed in the event of a moderate degree.

In the opinion of Judge 5 (unconstitutional), the Constitutional Court reaffirmed yesterday that Article 2 of the Law's supplementary provisions to abolish the bar examination does not violate the Constitution. The court does not recognize that there are changes in the circumstances to be judged or needs to be judged as opposed to its earlier decision to repeal the bar examination, declaring the intent of the prosecutions are unreasonable. The court ordered people preparing for the bar exam to move from selecting by test to training, give them a chance to take the exam for a certain period, and then gradually abolish the purpose of the trial. ◇ It is not limiting the freedom of choice of a student who has prepared for a trial, the court judged that the case does not limit the freedom of choice of jobs for those who prepared for the bar exam. The court said, "" I have a grace period of eight years to protect the trust of the judicial examination holders, and when the bar exam law is repealed, I enter the Law School and have received a limited degree. "" Considering the grace period altogether, we can`t consider the freedom of choice as a violation of minimum, and we don`t see abolition of the law as an infringement. Judge Lee Jin-seong, Kim Chang-jong, Ahn Chang-ho and Cho Yong-ho, who had raised their voices against the anti-sacrificial law during the earlier constitutional ruling, also maintained their views. Judge Cho Yong-ho, Lee Jin-seong, Kim Chang-jong and Ahn Chang-ho maintained their original unconstitutional opinions, saying the abolition of the judicial examination violated the right to choose jobs, to school room, and to equality. Law schools inevitably have a high-cost structure, Cho said, judging that the special admission system at law schools and the high tuition system alone have limitations in resolving high tuition costs. Cho said, "" People who can not afford law school degrees are not eligible to practice law and can not afford to be granted equal rights. Lee and three others said, "" Repealing the bar exam violates equal rights by blocking opportunities for the economically disadvantaged "" and added, "" Making it possible for the bar examination and the legal law school system to compete against one another directly on its merits is possible and possible.The judicial examination, which was first introduced in 1963 with the court`s decision and served as the training system for lawyers and the gateway to advancement for the nation for 54 years, will remain a historic institution.Jurist @. bo. gi. .. ▶. ▶. seoljeong. gwallyeonowing the news and photo related to PyeongChang 2018.

According to The Associated Press on July 26, Alan Robinson and Walter McFarlane, born and raised on Oahu Island in Hawaii, became best friends when they first met in elementary school in sixth grade. The two played football together at a private high school for 15 months and spent time together as close friends at parties. McFarlane and his adopted son Robinson, who do not know their father, have been building friendships by having to share their worries. Trying to find the father and the other family members McFarlane visited the DNA matching website and found the most matching id, the 737 Robi (with identical X chromosome), at the end of his wait. The surprising fact was that the main character of Robbie 737 was the same Robinson who had been in jail for 60 years. Robbie is a nickname for Robinson, and the 737 is an aircraft operated by Aloha Air pilot Robinson. Robinson used the same site to find his family. McFarlane and Robinson turned out to have the same biological mother. `` It was a shock, '' Robinson said in a radio interview. McFarlane laughed, saying, We are both hairy forearms. The two first told such amazing stories to their family members and friends at a party on May 23, just before Christmas.
