"New York's body fitness director, Shafrell Dallas, 17, and her right hand, [Photo : Shafrell Dallas Instagram] Wednesday introduced her daughter to be a twin. Shafrell is often mistaken for twin with his 17-year-old daughter Destiny. Shafrell has a skin and full of elastic bodies despite his age of 46. It is even more durable compared to the photos taken in their 20s. Mr Shafrell's job is the reason he is able to stay in shape. He has worked as a personal trainer since he was 21. `` Exercise gives you energy and confidence, '' he said. `` I did my best every day. '' In addition, they are strict eaters and never drink alcohol. Everyone is surprised when they find out that Destiny and Mother are together. Chaperel said, "" Although I often hear that I envy you, I owe it to my efforts to do so thoroughly. "" imne@fnnews.com Hongyeji reporter.....All the goal-butting stories in the world? Whenever you talk on the phone, the surroundings of the phone will shine brightly and the base station of the carrier will always be as bright as day. The microwave is not visible, so it just doesn't happen that loud. What if you could communicate by radio in visible light? In fact, a 2011 TED Conference introduced light as a topic that drew attention. Named Li-fi, the technique uses a light-blind real light bulb instead of a microwave generator antenna. The speaker played high-definition video after receiving data under a brightly lit LED light bulb. Until now, light was not used because it was harmful to wireless communication. Light creates shadows, the areas that can not reach even the smallest obstacle. If the smartphones in our hands now use light, the quality of the calls will get worse every time they pass through the shadows of trees. It is due to the basic nature of the wave and can not be solved by technique. Light can not go round the walls. It is so different from the sound of one wall being passed around freely. Despite these deadly shortcomings, it is clear why light is referred to as the latest wireless communication tool. That is because the merits of light have exceeded the disadvantages. The shortcomings that were a big problem in the past are now attainable. Wireless communication is not the same as before. ■ combined newsreeling technology is suitable for road-filled apartments that need fast communication speeds but are also filled with the light of LED light bulbs.Today, the top priority for wireless communication is speed. Individuals may be satisfied with their current speed. However, the news agency has a different opinion. Service providers have to deal with the growing traffic at a tremendous rate. As more than 10 people are watching video clips on one subway station and the amount of data that users exchange with each other has increased, the total traffic has grown dramatically from the past. Advanced technologies, such as the Internet of Things and autonomous vehicles, based on data transfer, will further increase traffic in the future. To provide a wide variety of services smoothly, the speed of communication should be much faster than now. Raising the pace is not as easy as speaking. To speed up on wireless communications, the range of frequencies used must be wide, with most spectrum already dominated by many operators. A table that lists the frequencies used by each operator is called a frequency table, and it is now difficult to find any empty seats in the table since the spectrum has been carefully distributed. Frequency is a finite resource. Service providers want to scale spectrum to increase communication speed, and build a ' broadband ' network to attract consumers, but they do not already have access to neighboring spectrum by other providers. With limited resources and many willing to use them, the price of spectrum licenses sold by the government is skyrocketing. In 2016, at a spectrum auction organized by the Ministry of Future and Creative Studies, the three companies spent more than 2 trillion won. ■ YouTube GalmurI A 2011 TED Talk using light drew attention. Li-fi technology uses a light-blind real bulb instead of a microwave oven.Fifth-generation mobile communications, following LTE, is most likely to use the ancient station frequencies they have not preferred before. It is highly unlikely that it will be easy to improve coverage areas due to the increasingly wide range of communications that are affected by the high station frequencies. If a wide range of frequencies is available, therefore, they would be willing to accept if they could communicate faster. Leipai is free from such problems, as weaknesses are overcome and strengths are highlighted. Light is not only wider in frequency than microwave, it is also available yet with no light to pre-empt that frequency. This is the biggest benefit of the L.I.P. Put simply, the company has the potential to become the fastest wireless communication. Another reason is that the environment is being created to overcome the shortcomings of the L`P. LED light bulb technologies and market expansion that have developed rapidly in recent years are typical examples. LED bulbs are essentially no different than semiconductor devices, allowing them to be precisely controlled for communication. LED lights can act as a kind of transmitting antenna. As mass production is possible, unit price is not expensive. Using various LED lights already embedded in everyday communication, there is no reason to lose communication unless one intentionally enters the shadows of light. Despite the inherent limitations of shadows, a huge number of cell sites make up for it. In addition, since expensive, large-scale microwave base stations do not need to be built here and there, the costs of creating an infrastructure can be reduced (and, of course, a unique LED light bulb specification or light-controlled circuit for communication). Security is particularly important. Because the leapier works only under a bulb, it can not communicate outside the bulb. You don't need to dial a password to stop people from using it next door like Wi-Fi. If there is any security problem, just turn off the light bulb. In other words, the disadvantage of being disadvantageous to wide area communication will be its strength. It also does not create an electromagnetic controversy. It is difficult to establish the whole notion that light is harmful. When combined with these advantages and disadvantages, it appears that the company is likely to replace Wi-Fi in the long run. It is suitable for indoor applications that need fast data communication, such as airplanes or subways, as well as areas filled with the light that LED lights produce. It is possible that data exchange, which was never imagined before, could occur. Cars with strong lights (headlights) can transfer data by using Ripie technology. Imagine if the road environment could be created if people could exchange information with their cars in real time and prevent accidents by using information. What the new technology is trying to overcome is more of an industrial problem than a technical one. Even in traditional microwave regions, the widespread use of the frequency range (if the traffic is aligned between operators) has resulted in a high speed. It is the operators who are already preempting the spectrum and are preventing data from accelerating. Various international bodies are pulling their heads together regarding the 5th generation mobile communication standard, and different industries prefer different frequencies. Even with such an easy technically operated path (an existing microwave communication), the firm has begun to discuss the replay as a new alternative, with the interests of several industry stakeholders complicated and difficult to resolve. The L'ifier illustrates the ' romanticism of new technology development ' that technologies try to solve with even non-technological issues (frequency consultation). The future of Rafie is not known until we look a little further. Positive and negative signals coexist after the technology was first demonstrated in public. Lippai's comeback to the headlines last year when the word ' Li-fi Capability ' was discovered on Apple's new operating system, iOS 9.1. Although the technology has not yet been commercialized, the possibility of applying a new technology in the future could be confirmed indirectly. However, the South Korean government stopped its research into the country's national research project in 2008.

"Choi Soon-sil, news reporter and news reporter Hwang Ki-sun, who was suddenly attacked by a bang on the desktop, revealed his strong feelings and ended his trial on December 7. The court suspended the trial on the same day because it was concerned about Choi's health.Choi was called on to take a rest around 3:00 p.m. during a trial on July 24 to investigate evidence of the document held by the Seoul Central District Court's criminal settlement department judge Kim Se-yoon. Choi, who was about to rise from the box office, suddenly collapsed again and burst into tears. It is the second time Choi cried loudly in court since the testimony of her daughter Chung Yoo-ra, 21, was found guilty in her trial last September.In an abrupt situation, a lawyer and a court chief approached Choi to check her condition. People tried to soothe him, but Choi's voice got louder. Choi cried, crying, "" I can't stand it, you can kill me! Either hurry or I don't want to live anymore. "" Choi's lawyers said, "" Be patient, "" and shouted, "" I don't want to live, I don't want to go. "" "" I can't live in such a rage, I don't blame you, "" he said with his fist on the desk.Choi then stomped and cried loudly as she bumped her upper body against the desk. "" I don't think I can live anymore, I don't think I can live anymore, "" she said. At the request of the court, a wheelchair appeared in the courtroom, and when the female court justice tried to seat her, Choi hesitated to sit on the floor and said, I can`t go. However, after being persuaded by lawyers, he moved into a wheelchair and retired around 3:32 p.m. It has been seven minutes since the court announced the suspension.After the court's recess, there were occasional screams and shouts that appeared to be Choi. Due to Choi's commotion, the court opened around 3:50 p.m., five minutes later than originally scheduled, when the court approved the revision.The trial started again, but only lawyers were present at the court. Choi rested in the waiting room of the accused in court. We have to go through the trial again, but we have a variable, explained Choi in very poor shape.While the judge and lawyer were discussing the procedure for the trial, the crying of an presumed waiting man and the shouting, "" What are you doing living? "" were heard inside the courtroom.Lee Kyung-jae, a lawyer for Choi, explained, It is very stressful to hear that Choi is seriously ill and that he recently received an arrest warrant in connection with the NIS special expenses.The court concluded the trial on the same day by saying Choi is no longer expected to attend the trial. The court has decided to set the trial date at 10:00 a.m. on July 7 and proceed with the interrogation of witnesses.themoon@news1.kr Check Your National Scholastic Aptitude Test questions and answers! How are you doing with the picture of the Hankyoreh? I am Sinjimin, the dreadful journalist for the team at 24. We are covering events and accidents that occur 24 hours a day in our society. Today, I'd like to talk to Kim Dong-sun (28), the third son of Hanwha Group Chairman Kim Seung-youn about an assault by new lawyers at the nation's largest law firm Kim & Chang. Why do lawyers get slapped with a hair and don't they sue you and don't want to punish you? This happened last September. It has been the talk of the town lately. Kim attended a social gathering of about 10 new lawyers for Kim & Chang, who took place at a bar in Jongno-gu, Seoul late September. Kim joined a meeting of new lawyers with an introduction of an acquaintance. The drunk Kim told lawyers, "" What are you doing with your father? "" and "" Sit up straight from now on, "" which led to assault. When Kim was drunk and couldn't keep her steady, the lawyers helped her, and she slapped the lawyer in the face. She also grabbed a female lawyer by the hair. But the lawyers did not file a lawsuit against Kim. It happened two months later, after this case was made public. When the victim was asked why she was not suing, a lawyer in Kim & Chang replied, "" How do you sue your client, "" and "" I don't know what he's doing with the lawyer's business? "" Eventually, the Korean Bar Association took part in the incident. Kim was charged with assault and battery, and prosecutors and police began investigating. However, Kim is not very likely to be punished. Assault is a crime against humanity, which can not be prosecuted if the victim does not want to be punished. If the lawyers don't want to punish Kim, that means the prosecution should drop the law. Insult is another offense punishable by the victim's complaint (Article 312-1 of the Criminal Law). But police investigations have also shown that lawyers do not want punishment for Kim. Why is it that Kim told me not to punish him for being slapped on the face and grabbed with a hair? Kim, who is a three-year-old at Hanwha Group, is not just a client, but a "" big customer. "" Hanhwa Group is one of Kim & Chang's main customers. Kim's father, Kim Seung-youn, had appointed six lawyers for Kim & Chang when he was booked for what he called a "" revenge offensive "" in 2007. Kim & Chang was paid hundreds of millions of won in commission for the case. Kim & Chang has "" swept "" not only the Hanhwa Group cases, but also the large criminal cases involving large conglomerates. Large corporations, which were investigated by prosecutors in the case of Lone Star's sale of KEB, SK Group slush funds, Doosan Group brothers ' dispute, and Hyundai Kia Motors slush funds, went to Kim & Chang fiercely. In addition, Kim was sentenced to eight months in jail and two years of probation in January for beating bar officials. Because of the "" same incident "" committed during the probation period, if convicted of assault again, the suspension would be canceled and jailed. Lawyers for the victims are unable to put you in jail with their hands. So, will Kim end up not being punished at all? Mr. Kim may have been in a commotion at a bar. Police are also checking the CCTV on the bar outside and identifying witnesses at the next table who will give an objective statement. The charge of interference is not against the doctors, so if confirmed by a CCTV or eyewitness account, Kim could be punished. The most bitter part of my coverage of this case was the attitude of the lawyers at large law firms, including Kim & Chang. It happened at a private meeting. It's too much to look at as client blood. "" "" It's not uncommon for paid clients to "" make mistakes "" when they're having drinks. "" After this incident, I told my lawyers. Ordinary citizens and the lawyers were angry at each other, and they were nothing more than business. If a 28-year-old man, not a chaebol, hit an attorney, would the lawyers have walked away?

"▽ Review of the National Scholastic Aptitude Test scores of Seoul National University High School students and their math abilities were tested on July 24. Ahn Hong-seok, reporter at Yonhap News Agency, said, "" In order to apply for the popular subjects at major universities such as Seoul National University, Yonsei University and Korea University in 2018, applicants need to obtain higher scores than Korean, mathematics, and research scores based on 280. Sky Training Center at the Mega Study and Jongno Institute presented these projections based on analysis of their own store price points on July 24. Megastudy expects the admission rate of SNU medical school departments to 295, and business school expects that Seoul National University will make 294 and management 295. The SNU Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering predicted the success of the test with 279 points for Mega Studies and 287 for Jongno Institute. The successful candidate for major majors from Yonsei University and Korea University is expected to get between the second half of 280 and the first half of 290, the admission companies predicted. The joint management acceptance line predicted that Megastudy would score 290, Chongno University 293, Megastudio English Institute 280 and Jongno Institute 291. The team's dental plan is to have 283 Mega Studies and 291 Jongno Institute. In the old economics department and medical schools, Megastudy expects 288 points and 289 points, respectively, while Chongno University predicts 293 points for both departments. In the case of Sogang University, Megastudy offered 278 in the business department, 274 in the humanities, and 269 in the field of chemical, biological and engineering. The expectations of the Sogang University's admission to the school are 290 for business school, 287 for humanities and 279 for chemical, biological, and engineering departments. Professor Yi of Sungkyunkwan University forecast 290 for the Mega Study and 293 for the Jongno Institute. Global Management of the University is based on 281 Mega Studies and 291 Jongno Institute. The expected number of successful candidates at Ewha University was comparatively wide apart. The humanities department forecast Megastudy to have 273 points and Jongno Institution`s 235 points, while the natural sciences to have 265 points, and the Chong-ro Academy forecast 273. The acceptance line to other major universities such as Hanyang University, Jungang University, and Hankuk University of Foreign Studies is also expected to score between 270 and 280. Admissions companies have made such predictions, but one should not predicate their grades based on the number of points on the CSAT. Test takers should use the test results based passing line forecast provided by the admission companies as a reference for their relative positions only. The CSAT scores, percentiles, and grades will be displayed on the scores of different areas, but the original scores will not be displayed. Universities can also use standard scores and percentiles to determine who passed the exam. ahs@yna.co.kr ▶ Report and enquiries (click!) ▶ Starbucks coffee for the 400 Minutes Yonhap news channel (local time) July 23 : the fattest man in the world, Juan Pedro Franco, is in surgery for a second round of resection, Mexico. P.S. The world's fattest man has had second stomach surgery.According to AFP, Mexican man Juan Pedro Franco (33) is recovering after undergoing surgery to lose weight on July 22 (local time).Franco's doctor Jose Antonio Kastaneda said, "" Franco's surgery is done well, "" adding, "" We are very optimistic. ""Franco entered the Guinness Book of Records last December as the fattest man in the world, weighing 595 kilograms. The fattest man ever was Mexican man Manuel Urbeiger, who died in May last year.Franco began his weight loss program a year ago and underwent a first stomach operation until May. This is because he had to treat diabetes, high blood pressure, and lung problems as they seriously deteriorated his health.The procedure was carried out with minimal invasive laparoscopic surgery. The aim was to cut Franco's stomach in half and to remove some of his intestine.Franco currently weighs 336 kilograms and aims to lose an additional 200 kilograms in surgery. The hospital said, "" Franco hopes to go down to under 120kg. ""If the goal is met, the patient can stop treating diabetes and high blood pressure, and we expect to be able to walk again in seven years, he said. After news spread that the Argentine submarine San Juan de San Juan exploded underwater on July 15, the crew members were filled with anger and sorrow. The Argentine navy confirmed on July 23 (local time) that the sonar sound waves detected near the last communication point of the ARA San Juan submarine that went missing were believed to be an explosion. After making the final call on July 15, an unusual underwater sound was detected in Lake San Juan. The Navy previously stated on July 17 that "" sounds may not coincide with submarines "" and "" these could come from life. "" Eventually, the chances of the 44 crew members surviving have become slim, the AP reported. The unusual sonar is equivalent to one short, violent non-nuclear blast by Argentine Navy spokesman Enrique BaldI, told a family of crew members on board. The San Juan ship went missing during a routine mission to return to its parent port, the Mardel-Flatta, from Ussuaia base in southern America on July 15.In front of the naval base in Mardella, Argentina on July 19 (local time), wishing to rescue the missing submarines and crew members, find them. We are Waiting, ' and a picture is hung. The A.A. New Sis ' relatives were excited to hear that a submarine exploded underwater just before a military news conference. `` There is no hope now. We were all angry and they were all lost in shame, "" he said. "" They lied to us, and now they can tell that the submarine had blown up. """
"- I will ask Lee Geum-hee, the mother of the plaintiffs Cho Eun-hwa, for her statement on September 7 before the separation ceremony. - I will ask for the truth behind the two counts of silver coin and Dayoon bone in Mokpo, and ask for a nondisclosure. Officials from the Maritime and Fisheries ministries will come down to Mokpo from time to time to check, inspect and support the area, Kim promised. We are concerned about the safety of our workers because the heat wave is still going on. Please do your best on this. `` Don't ask the media for confirmation of bones in real time, '' the late Cho Eun-hwa family writer said. Officials at the Maritime and Fisheries ministries have reportedly not covered up the results of the expedition against the remains of the Sewol accident for five days. Lee Keum-hee, Jo Eun-hwa's mother, told IdalI on July 24, "" I feel relieved to hear that my family and Dayoon were separated because they were so unhappy, "" adding, "" but those requests were made before September 23 - 25. "" According to the investigation results, Lee Chul-jo, head of the follow-up team of the Maritime Ministry, and Vice President Kim Hyun-tae decided to keep the fact that they have collected fragments of bone fragments that were discovered on July 17 as confidential. After the first report to Kim Young-choon on the afternoon of July 20, when the launch ceremony of five would-be swimmers was completed, Kim Chang-jun, head of the hull investigation team, and his mother explained the situation to him yesterday. When the five relatives of the would-be refugees protested and the media reported the news, the news broke on the afternoon of July 22 and revealed the results of a bone removal scandal. However, Lee explained that the fragments that were discovered on July 17 were closed to the public, considering requests from some families. "" The secretary of the Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Department called me on the phone on the 20th, "" he said. Da-yoon and Do-hwan would not let my mother know because they don`t want my mother to tell the media. ' At the request of the two families, the Maritime Ministry has been confirmed to have kept the fact that they have collected fragments of fragments from the wall to the bottom of the dam. After the split in late September, the ministry called to inform the sailor, The bones of the silver found were so small that they were used up during DNA tests. We asked the media not to let us know about this."" I heard from the sea that the DNA tests on the rocks in early November indicate that the silver and Dayun had been taken into bones, "" Lee said, heartlessly hurting other families. The press will not know about the training. Dogae and Dayun have not gone to look for bones yet. Lee said, It is a mistake not to have told the five relatives of the would-be chairman of the family, and to have not reported the incident to the minister immediately, Kim Cheol-jo, head of the ministry, and vice-chief committee. I think I made a wrong decision to be considerate of my family, said Park. In particular, Lee said Kim was designated as one of the ` red lung officials `, not the ` red lung officials `. If we brand it as an enemy attack, who would want to come to the scene of the accident when some officials could hear it, Lee said in an interview with the ministry. The following are the highlights of his interview with Lee. Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Kim Young-choon told the press room at the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts at 4:00 p.m. on July 23 that we apologize to the victims of the accident, and that we are coordinating the case with the bereaved families. [Photo = Combined News] - Kim Hyun-tae, the chief of the department, asked for the closure of bone fragments? Gaero and Dayun, the mother, asked the media not to tell her bone verification news. They did not want the results of finding a bone fragment to be known in real time. When the bone fragments of my child were discovered, I felt ' glad you had returned. ' But on the other hand, it hurt. It was sad news for families who could not find a bone fragment. So, I made the request before my farewell ceremony (Cho Eun-hwa and Heo Da-yoon on September 23-25). - Because of this request, do you think they have been cleaned up on the 17th?I feel uncomfortable because our request may have influenced our decision to close it. So far, the bones of Dayoon, Hwangho, and Lee Young-sook have been lifted from the hull of the ship. Kim seemed to think that it was most likely that it was the bone of Dayun and silver. Kim might have been concerned about the situation of the family members who asked for the news of the drill to be closed when it was revealed to the media. - Have you ever heard the reason for the non-disclosure from the water department?On July 20, the secretary of the Maritime Affairs Department at the Site of Sewol Prison gave an explanation. The secretary said by telephone, ' It is most likely that the bones of Dayun and the silver coin were discovered on the 17th. I won't let you know because I don't want my mother to tell the media. ' - Are there any results of a break-taking process that hasn't been notified to the media in the past?There is a sauce. After the split in late September, the Maritime Ministry telephoned to inform the nation that the bones of the silver found were so small that they were used up during the DNA tests. So, he asked the media not to let him know. And I heard from the sea department that DNA test results showed that the silver and Dayun had been fixed as bones. Dayoon discussed with her mom and dad whether to go to Mokpo to look for it. Let's not hurt other family members (who haven't found a bone fragment). "" The press will not know about the training. The silver coin and Dayun have not gone to look for bones yet. - Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Minister Kim Young-choon did not make such statement at a news conference yesterday.So I sent a text message to Kim Hyun-tae, the assistant manager of the team. He told me not to let you know that I found a bone fragment. Kim said, ' I'm sorry for the lack of me. That's all right. I'm a criminal, ' she said in reply. - Still, it was not until July 17 that he found a bone fragment and reported it to the minister for the first time. There is a problem which has not been notified to the families of the five would-be inmates. It is also wrong not to report directly to the Minister of Gaere. If he had reported immediately, Minister Kim Young-choon might have made a decision. But Lee Chul-jo, in a briefing yesterday, said, I planned to hold a memorial service at 9 a.m. on the 18th, but the altar I had set up the previous night was damaged by strong winds. As I rushed to the indoor during the early morning, I was totally thrown out of my mind, ' he said. Chief Lee and Deputy Director Kim are each of the heads of state and department. As high-ranking government officials and lawmakers are here to pay their respects, it would have been hard to tell even if I had seen the minister there. It is a mistake for the Maritime Ministry, including Kim and Lee Cheol-jo, to stop talking to the families of the five would-be swimmers. At the time, Kim did not seem to have expected the issue to grow so big. So I believe that they (Kim Hyun-tae and Lee Chul-jo) made a wrong judgment in order to be considerate of their family. If they reported it to their families (five attempted inmates) or their minister immediately or told their friends about the situation, they would not have been distorted. - Kim, a vice-captain a practice that is Park Geun-hye was appointed by the government to interfere with the truth comes claims as a public official. Gaerage Kim is not a government employee who deserves to be injured. He is one of those officials who have suffered since the Sewol accident. He went away on assignment, and worked there. If they are branded as ` enemy evil `, who would want to come to the scene of the Sewol accident where government officials can hear ` enemy evil ` in the future? And even field office workers can get trauma after staying on the scene for a long time. It is because they deal with people with injuries. It is heartbreaking to hear when it comes to referring to struggling field employees as "" appropriate abuses. "" - the Office of the Audit and Inspection of the Maritime Ministry is investigating the truth. Would you go in person and state what you said in the interview?I will talk to you later. It is natural to do us a favor and talk if you have been so confidential. People say, ' A silver coin's mother could be in trouble if she hears about it. ' But I said ' It's okay.

The president said, "" the CSAT exam takers informed the Pohang is about 59 million, or about 5,600 people are there in the area of less than 1 percent. So at first, the government didn't make it easy to think that we could delay the CSAT, and that if it weren't for an unfair test, "" But if it was just one earthquake that would break the exam site, then I'd be nervous (students). "" Although all students are important, the safety of Pohang students, less than 1 percent of them, and fairness of Pohang students were more important, so I decided to act, "" explained Cho. The president also talked during the earthquake, "" I was then race house I live in a country house, so it's house in mass production is poor. The house was badly damaged by the earthquake. In fact, be president unless recovery would be new, like, should, do the ""saying"" the anxiety that the time, vividly than anyone else.I feel. "" He said, "" Pohang has a lot of earthquake damage, so it is a little bit difficult to repair the damage right now, and the trauma that it causes can be very severe. The healing and recovery of such psychological trauma is important, he said. He also said, "" The earthquake is not safe for the nation to do so, especially in the southeast, such as Pohang and Ulsan in Gyeongju. As it is confirmed that there are multiple active faults, the active faults are quickly identified underground to provide fundamental countermeasures against earthquakes, and seismic design, including the various school structures, is vulnerable to earthquakes.

"Choi Jae-gu, a reporter at Seocho High School in Seoul, is trying to add another grade to the CSAT results on July 24. jjaeck9@yna.co.kr A ratio of ' 8-9 % ' is expected to reach 43,000-93,000. Admissions companies have announced similar cuts this year. Based on the cut line estimates released by each company on July 24, eight companies, such as Etoos, Daeseong, Jinhak, YounghwaI, Jungang Education, Sky Eddish, and Emergency Education, predicted Korean Language 1 point, and other scores were made up of 10. The first grade in Korean language courses, estimated from the reported test scores and percentiles, was up one or two points from last year when the test scores were 92. Eight companies predicted that they would score 92 points for math test and Na grade. Last year's first-ranked cut was also 92 points for both brothers and Na. Nam Yoon-gon, director of the Research Center for Admissions and Admissions Studies, said math was as difficult as it was last year, adding, "" The math classes students usually see are the same as the multiple choice of questions in the second half of the multiple-choice and subjective rites. "" When combined with the estimated Korean and mathematics grade-level kits, this year`s CSAT was not as easy as last year`s grades, which is considered to be a nonperformance. It is estimated that the percentage of students who will receive the first grade this year is 8-9 percent, as they scored more than 90 points in the English section, which has changed to an absolute assessment. Lee Young-duk, director of Daeseong Research & Development Institute, and Nam Yoon-gon, director of the institute, forecast around 8 percent. Assuming that the prediction is correct, the first grade in English will be between 43,000 and 49,000, based on the number of applicants (548,241). Though it is difficult to compare them in simple terms, it seems that the number of students who scored more than 90 points on the CSAT last year was 42,000, or 7.8 % of the total. Among social research areas, ethics and thought were forecast to score 50 out of seven major applicants with first-class kits, followed by a perfect score of Life, Ethics, Law and Politics, Geography and Economy. Predictions of a first rank cut in the scientific field were evenly distributed between 43 and 47 points. jylee24@yna.co.kr "" We love elders, party generals, and fathers. "" "" After finishing the hereditary process, I told them that I will not know what to call Reverend Kim. "" As if he was aware of the criticism on the succession of a prestigious church, Reverend Kim Ha-na said, I will prove that the concerns do not apply to us, although the concerns of the world are appropriate.The issue of succession to a large church has resurfaced to the surface due to the succession of a prestigious church. As the succession to the church became a social issue, the President-General of Korea created the law in 2013. However, a major church in the ministry, called ' One Year's Budget Only ', pushed for the transfer of wealth. After the passage of the law, Kim Sam-hwan and Kim Ha-na declared in one place, "" A ban on the inheritance means God's will, and a ban on the hereditary succession is an anachronistic and historic call. "" That is why criticism is pouring in from outside the church, not to mention the church, over the succession.The school system refers to the 1997 Chunghyeon Church in Seoul as a watershed for the issue of succession to a large church. After Kim Chang-in resigned from the church, Chung-hyeon welcomed a few others and handed over the appointment of Kim Chang-in's son to the ministry. Since then, a fierce battle between the rich and the poor has caused the church to divide. Reverend Kim Chang-in publicly confessed in 2012 that it was wrong to hand over the church to his son, and outside of the church, it is only known as a bad case of a rich hereditary power.However, the teaching profession is looking at the incident differently. "" If you believe that when you see Reverend Kim Chang-in as having a conflict with his successor after you stepped down, it is not only the case that you see your son as your successor, "" one pastor said. "" Of course, the case of Chung-hyun's church affairs is not really about to be made. "" Chunghyun Church is regarded as a failure, but in reality, it has been the main reason for large churches to continue their hereditary power succession each year since then.Those who advocate giving birth to their children are all the same. They claim the long-term stability of the religious community that a large church can remain intact when it is succeeded by adoption. Still, the rich are left with the same kind of power, ' and if criticism continues, do not speak out of "" Why do you argue with other people's church affairs? "" Register and raise questions from within.However, experts criticize that such claims are an abuse of the Protestant Church's principle of incorporation. The Bible stresses that the Church belongs to the Community, and that it is not a blood community but a covenant based on the word of God.Reverend Lee Jin-oh, who is campaigning for a healthy little church, said, "" I wanted to be accepted as a small church. "" "" I don't ask why each church should have its own way, but I think it's a huge church, and why it's one big church, and through its craftiness, assembly. "" In the Yojang Joint Church, the minister pointed out that the sandmaid acts as a parson to individual churches, so he goes to a prestigious church in the capacity of a ' delegator '. "" Protestant Church's founding principle is to deny the pope's closed and oppressive control, "" Lee said, adding, "" In fact, the Protestant Church's attempts to raise its profile by conforming smaller churches have become wealthy and itself. "" In the case of a pioneering church, both the minister and the elderly were strongly raised as "" My Church. "" The people who are on the phone most often are spouses of church leaders. The long story begins with "" How the church was founded with its entire body wrapped up in a room eating and sleeping. "" A sense of crisis is based on this perception that the church can fall when the church's founder leaves. The problem of ministers ' difficulty in finding jobs can not be ignored. The teaching profession needs one hundred thousand ministers, with an estimated three hundred thousand. Already with 200,000 extra workers, the competition for seats is fierce, with the population falling and the number of young Catholics decreasing faster. Prepossessional ministers are also pouring in. As I know my son's way around, I could tempt him to back out of my church.Some say that the shadow of money and power also appears. "" If you operate a medium church with about 500 members in the metropolitan area, you can get a substantial annual income and receive treatment, "" one pastor said. In other words, it is better to have your own family members because it takes less resistance from a successor to exert influence even after retirement. Because of this, some argue that the succession to the church should be considered an extension of the power of the father, not a precise "" inheritance of a son. ""Critics say that the assembly and the cunning of the religious circles, which need to supervise individual churches, are also to blame. In the case of Myungsung Church, the southeast protectorate turned the decision over when he first refused to take power, and the general meeting suggested revising the law last September because the law banning inheritance was harsh. Large churches pay a lot for their pretences, assembly meetings, and support for the church.The lukewarm response of Christians is also problematic. Additions to the priests are problematic, but the problem-minded ones also come to see God and see the reverend. Or, "" How can friends be so hesitant when they are here? "" Given such reactions, no church had ever closed because of a backlash from lawmakers trying to succeed in succession. "" If the congregation does not turn decisively, there is no reason to panic, "" one minister argued.

"Park Yong-man, chairman of the National Assembly, said, "" If the high income bracket benefits from the structure, it rotates 5.7 kilometers per day, and if they don't want to listen to the town council's labor unions, they will not communicate with them at all. "" If we don`t change the minimum wage range and raise the minimum wage next year, the business community can not stand it any more, said Park Yong-man, head of the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Park visited the National Assembly to explain the economic community's stance on the minimum wage system. "" I've been walking 5.7 kilometers a day through the National Assembly Hall. Of course, if I tell you that I've explained my difficulties and told you that I don't want to hear from you, I won't want to communicate with you. "" So far, job creation and of Win-Win Cooperation and Moon Jae-in, including in the government's economic policy, the business to ‘partner’, which gives The Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry have been the unprecedented role.‘bitter’ It's all. Park's voice grew stronger as the minimum wage hike (16.4 percent increase from this year) was made a month ahead, and the National Assembly approved the revision to the minimum wage law on July 9. Since bonuses and food and lodging are not included in the current minimum wage, a small increase in the minimum wage will increase the overall wage range. The intention of raising the minimum wage is to raise the wages of the low-income bracket, which would allow limited resources to be passed on to those with higher incomes, Park said, emphasizing only about the actual wage being paid back. The Park for three hours, Woo Double the per share fishermen, Uidang-myeon Ahn Cheol-soo national representatives visited leaders of the ruling and opposition parties, including the office. In a 26-page book, he said, Let's create realistic alternatives, by delivering an expert recommendation on recent economic issues. The Korean Federation of Business Unions, which received public warnings from Cheong Wa Dae after raising questions about non-regular workers ' policy for regular workers, also spoke out yesterday. Vice Chairman Kim Young-bae is worried that a rise in the minimum wage next year without revision will have a huge impact on all industries, he said, conveying the president`s opinion that the problem would be solved at the National Assembly. The reason why the business community is against this is because the pro-labor policies of the government have a huge impact on the economy. Some say that the government should introduce a "" differential minimum wage system "" because employers, small businesses and small businesses, and small businessmen, are under pressure. It is reasonable to apply the minimum wage differently depending on the regional economic situation and the ability of each sector to create added value, said Sung Tae-yoon, economics professor at Yonsei University. In reality, wage rates are applied in different regions in the U.S. and in Japan.

"If conflicts grow between service providers and platform operators in the U.S. and other providers, such as Facebook and Naver, grow or if the same rates of access to content are met, the policy of abolition of the Netflix platform may require a higher rate. Because it would be legally possible for the network's ISP operators to discriminate against data-intensive platforms. Office worker Kim Min-cheol opened a social media application on his way home from work. The app, which has more than 10 million users in Korea, has slowed down access rates considerably since one day. When I clicked video that my friend uploaded when I went on a trip, the video was constantly interrupted and the screen was broken. After her return, Kim played a video platform that showed her live ' Cook Room ' on her computer. However, the broadcast was stopped after about five minutes.Moving forward, video platforms and social media, where people spend the most time on mobile and the Internet, may turn into video platforms that are charged or have a significant decline in service quality. It has recently decided to scrap the ' network-neutrality ' principle in the U.S. If network neutrality is abolished, access to the site could be blocked, as in the case of a left screen, or access to the site may be required at a charge. The principle of network neutrality is that ISPs should not discriminate between services provided over networks and content. It means that although mobile service providers set up a network that costs a great deal of money, anyone has the right to use it. In 2015, the former Barack Obama administration established a network-neutrality policy, regarding Internet networks as public goods. The most famous ISPs in Korea are KT and SK broadband and LG U +. However, the Donald Trump administration recently decided to scrap the rule. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), like the Korea Communications Commission (KCC), is set to put a final vote on a bill to scrap the principle of neutrality next month. The decommissioning plan is expected to pass without a doubt, with the majority of FCC members likely to be Republican with the ruling camp. The US policy on network neutrality is a key reference to other countries. That is why Korean mobile phone service operators as well as Internet service providers pay keen attention to the issue. The principle of network neutrality has been the basis for the rapid growth of multI-platform enterprises based on content over the years. From overseas companies such as Facebook, Google and Netflix, local IT companies such as Naver and Kakao have all expanded their presence by providing image, video and multimedia content. Netflix has launched a campaign to protest the abolition of the principle of network neutrality. Photographs are Twitter posts that call for users to pay attention to the principle of network neutrality. [Twitter Capture] The abolition of network neutrality enables network operators to restrict access or slow down the pace of Internet service providers. Facebook and Kakao Talk can make it difficult to send and receive large files such as photos or videos. At the center of such a controversy was the question of who would bear the costs of constructing and maintaining the network. Back when network operators (mobile operators) used to make big money on telecommunications fees alone, service providers paid for them in full. However, things changed when platform operators such as Facebook and Naver began to grow into big businesses and make big money. ISPs have been demanding payment for their use of the network. As the principle of networthiness appears to be about to be repealed, many U.S. cable TV companies are predicting that Netflix will be charged a fee. It is very difficult for Netflix to refuse to pay its fees. Network operators have little weapon of service speed control. The fee negotiation between ISPs and Internet service providers has resulted in an impact on consumers. The reason is that if negotiations are not smooth, the use of the data will be slowed and even if negotiations are successful, the network fees will be transferred. Mobile service operators are also likely to significantly change their rates. It is highly likely that a "" usage-based "" system will introduce a use-based rate system, which changes the price depending on the amount of fees. There is also the possibility of a text fee without just posting or watching video clips, and a high fee for video versions that will do a lot of good. For service providers under pressure to lower their telecom rates, it could help expand their operations. It is because mergers and acquisitions (M&A) could be actively carried out in various fields such as communications and broadcasting. Because domestic communication service providers can acquire video contents and platforms to expand their businesses and, on the contrary, they can reduce the speed of access to competing platforms that do similar business. Local governments have implemented guidelines for network neutrality in accordance with the 2011 global trend. The government in August enacted a measure to strengthen such principles by setting up an unfair standard of conduct for the imposition of irrational and discriminatory conditions among telecommunication operators. If the ICT business environment changes significantly in the global market, we will have to come up with countermeasures in Korea, said an official at the Ministry of Science and Technology and Information.

I will try my best to explain again and clear up the misunderstanding in today's process. Whether Jeon is arrested or not is expected to be decided by the end of the night or early Tuesday. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office's first investigation into the latest crime (senior prosecutor Shin Bong-soo) sought an arrest warrant for Jeon yesterday on charges of accepting bribes, taking bribes and embezzlement for certain crimes. Jeon is accused of giving 330 million won in donations to the e-Sports Association of Korea, where he was appointed as honorary chairman, in April 2015. Lotte Home Shopping was then in the run-up to the re-approval of its business license, and Jeon is suspected of being in return because he was a member of the National Assembly's Future Creation, Scientific and Broadcasting Commission. It is judged that Lotte Home Shopping gave a subsidy to an unrelated e-sports association in July of the same year to Jeon on condition that she does not have any problems with her re-election.Jeon is also accused of having her family use the gift card Lotte Home Shopping gave her for five million won. Lotte has also paid for accommodation at a resort worth millions of won.Prosecutors applied embezzlement charges against those who paid one million won per month to secretaries and internships at the former senior National Assembly as funds for e-sports. However, the prosecution did not include in its arrest warrant for former senior secretary Yoon, who allegedly embezzled about 500 million won in donations.Jeon has denied the allegations, saying, I have never engaged in any irregularity. The prosecution fully explained its misunderstanding and questioning about me, after being summoned and questioned for 17 hours as a suspect on July 20, the official said.Moon Jae-in government ruling party official This is the first time that she has been in danger of becoming binding.

Former Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin was the first person detained during the investigation to be released after an investigation into whether or not he was detained. After seeing her release, former defense minister for policy planning and planning, Lim Kwan-bin, also requested that the arrest be re-determined. If Lim is released, the investigation on military politics and election involvement will have to end. A prosecution official said, After a physical examination of a warrant, all of my men were detained, but I don`t understand why not release them after about 10 days? Of the 2,246 eligible documents to be sent to court last year, only 367 were cited. Kim passed the narrow gate of 15.2 percent. Prosecutors explain that individual criminals who commit traffic accidents or deception are usually released due to changes in the circumstance of the payment or settlement of damages after arrest, and it is extremely rare for offenders to be released due to corrupt crimes or other laws. "" There are a few cases in which an enemy is asked to leave the case, but I don't think he was released, "" a prosecution official said.

Kim is most likely to be put on trial without physical detention. The court can not appeal the consequences of the arrest warrant, and can not seek an arrest warrant again based on the facts of the existing crime unless the released suspect runs away or destroys evidence. Prosecutors seem to disagree with the court's decision that there is no fear of destroying evidence. Prosecutors say Kim talked with Lim in August and September, and former cyber commander Yeon Je-wook during the investigation. The prosecution's position of "" common sense is hard to accept "" immediately after the 51 Seoul Central District Court ordered the release on July 22 was due to growing complaints that the court had overlooked additional investigation by an accomplice. Shin Kwang-yul, the chief justice of the court, is the Supreme Court justice Choi Seon-im. Judge Shin will also hold a hearing on the former chief of staff Lim's office. Kim's defense team said, "" As a member of the ruling camp, the former minister, who served as a government official, was not allowed to issue any comments on the crime against the government and military officials. The court accepted this, to a certain extent, the possibility of arguing over whether or not to commit a crime. The judgment changed when the judge issued an arrest warrant on July 11, saying, It is called "" leisure time for political officials who are suspected of being the main culprits. "" Investigators plan to spend some time and harden their suspicions.

Korean scores are expected to appear as variables in the natural sciences ' On-Time Support strategy. On the morning of July 24, the test standards company analyzed the first grade of Korean language grade cut points of 93-94 and the standard score of 129. The analysis shows that the test results of the students were higher by one or two points compared to the analysis that the test results were difficult due to the long fingerprints of the reading areas and the contents of the specialized fields such as science, technology and economics. Nam Yoon-gon, director of the Maga Research Center for Admissions Strategy, said, "" Experts had previously suggested the first grade cut in Korean would have been made between 91 and 92. "" "" I usually classify grade one cut as a difficult test when it is formed at 92 to 94. "" "" It was a little bit more difficult to assess in June than it was in September, "" said Lim. In mathematics, the first grade cut of the first and third graders was rated 92, followed by the standard score of 125 and 131, respectively. In mathematics, the results of the math test were based on difficulty analysis. Considering that the first grade cut in the CSAT last year was 92, the standard score was 136, and the same as last year's CSAT score, it is considered to be similar difficulty. Types of provisional payments are likely to be different from one to three depending on how many questions are answered in the top 20, 21, 29 and 30 questions. Na also said, "" Even though I have a similar problem with last year, the problem of identifying the most senior students will be resolved to 21 or 30 times. The English section, which was first converted to absolute evaluation this year, is expected to have a rating of 8-9 percent or higher on the first grade. Lee Joon-sik, a professor of Chinese literature at Sungkyunkwan University, said on the first day of the examination, "" I expect the average score to be around that level because eight percent of Mopyeong students and six percent of September were in the first grade. "" However, judging from the results of the high prices, the difficulty levels felt by the test-takers were slightly easier than Mopyeong in June. Lim was evaluated as being able to distinguish English on the CSAT last year and should consider it to have been similar or a little easier. Won Ho-yeon : / why 37 @ How to Live Safer Ruck BE. Amid growing concerns over a lack of oxygen, the submarine is presumed to have exploded, causing a faint hope of rescue. The Argentine navy confirmed that the submarine San Juan was captured by the media on July 23 (local time), the eighth day after it went missing, and that the South Korean navy had caught the submarine San Juan several hours after it made a final call. "" The unusual sonar is consistent with one short, violent nuclear bomb, "" Navy spokesman Enrique BalbI said. Mrs. Valby said she had forwarded this information to the families of the crew members aboard the San Juan, saying, "" The search has been carried out until the fate of the San Juan is confirmed. "" Ships and aircraft have been dispatched to the affected area and are once again on the hunt. Experts fear that if the San Juan is submerged, it could face a loss of 7 to 10 days ' worth of reserve oxygen. The San Juan, which was traveling from Ushuaia in the southernmost part of the Americas to the Mardel-Flatta base with 44 crew members, was contacted by the Navy Headquarters for the last time since it was lost 400 kilometers off the coast of Patagonia on July 15. At the time of the last communication, the whereabouts of the battery system were unknown, after it was announced that it would return to the naval base of the Mardel-Plaster Galaxy. It was then revealed that several clues of hope originated from submarines, including seven satellite calls received, sonar, flashing lights and rescue boats, but were soon confirmed to have been disappointed and waited for their submarine to be rescued.It hangs on a fence at the Mukjuga del Plata naval base in hopes that the San Juan crew would return safely.

"As the holidays approaches, wage debates are heating up again. Business circles and labor circles are voicing their opinions as the minimum wage committee discusses a reform of the minimum wage in 30 years, approaching a month or so. The business community does not deny the purpose of the minimum wage increase itself, but points out that the current minimum wage range, in which businesses and small businesses and small businesses will benefit from the burden of higher wages and workers must be corrected. Meanwhile, labor circles, however, are opposed to the reform, saying, It is just a trick by the business community to avoid raising wages in any way.Kim Young-bae, vice chairman of the General Association of Korean Industries, is sitting down after attending a breakfast forum at the Korea Shipbuilding Hotel in central Seoul yesterday.Yonhap news agency announced on July 23 that when the president of the association, Kim Young-bae, only half year after the announcement, is expected to make a huge dent in the pay scale, which is not reasonable to meet global standards.True, European countries, including Britain and France, calculate minimum wage, including food and lodging costs, but Korea insists that it has no bonuses or non-regulation benefits but basic and fixed allowances.It is absurd for Korea to include much of the wage that workers are guaranteed to pay, such as regular bonuses, in the minimum wage range, Kim said. As a result, employees of large companies that receive more than 40 million won a year, including regular bonuses and other benefits, are classified as those who are eligible for the minimum wage."" The low-paid workers ' minimum living security system is not actually creating more benefits for the large conglomerates ' high-paid employees, "" Kim said, adding, "" This does not fit the basic purpose of our dual market system. "" Also, wages and valuables paid to workers, such as regular bonuses and food bills, should be included in the minimum wage bracket, "" said the National Assembly's latest parliamentary session, in which the issue will be reemphasized to resolve the issue.● Business organizations, including the KEC, should revise their minimum wage range after deciding that next year's minimum wage would be 7530 won, up 16.4 percent from this year's (6470 won). Regardless of the government's positive opinion, it is believed that a dramatic rise in minimum wage would make small and mid-sized companies as well as conglomerates more vulnerable to the burden. Current minimum wage only includes regular or regular monthly wage payment, such as basic salary, work allowance, and job benefits. Bonuses, extension, night and holiday work allowance are not included in the minimum wage, the business community argues, making even new employees at large companies underpaid.A foreign corporate labor official said, "" As a result of our own simulations, we are classified as minimum wage earners with an annual salary of 45 million won for substitution-grade young workers, and we are required to pay only about 16 million won to raise wages based on the minimum wage of 40 million won per employee. ""Businesses are especially arguing that this year is not the only problem. According to the government's suggestion, the minimum wage should be raised to 10,000 won by 2020, which is the same as this year's (16.4 percent) for at least two years. The minimum wage increase rate for 2018 (16.4 percent) is immediately higher than the previous five-year average of 7.4 percent. As a result, the government will provide businesses with an additional 120,000 won (10,000,000 won) in additional labor costs, equivalent to 9 percent of the average person's salary.● Expanding the scope of income into labor areas may damage the purpose, but the industry is now insisting that expanding the minimum wage range will only undermine the effect of minimum wage hikes. They say that the bonuses and welfare benefits of the minimum wage system would undermine the purpose of the minimum wage system to ensure the stable livelihood of low-wage workers.It is the business community, not the labor sector, that created the complicated wage system now, Kang Hoon-jong, said, to avoid using whatever social consensus that the business community should raise the minimum wage. Some point out that cheap workers could suffer losses if the minimum wage is paid by using the money as an excuse to hire workers from large companies.The average working hours of the KFO were increased to more than 240, saying, "" The 40 million won minimum wage claimed by the KEC is not very exaggerated, "" Kang said. The law, however, implies that the companies can vary the basic wage composition items for wages based on the basic salary composition, while leaving the total amount of wages as it is, and provides the minimum wage range as usual.▶ whoami@seoul.co.kr an interesting world press yuyeonggyu, ▶ [Now news] [free of cartoon] [Facebook] ⓒ The Seoul Shinmun (www.seoul.co.kr), unauthorized war damage and redistribution of Moon Jae-in.4th president is listening on earthquake damage from officials to hear, Pohang-si, Gyeongbuk, Korea.

"A squirrel that evolved as an isolated Ice Age species and photographed in Sorak Mountain with millions of exports and Lyme Disease Hosts until 1980s in South Korea. It is highly probable that it is a native species on the Korean Peninsula. Supplied with Wikipedia Commons : a busy season for squirrels. They fill their bags with bambolies, acorns, and seeds that fell on the forest floor and enter a storage warehouse made by digging deep underground. Prepare to hibernate in the middle of the following month when the temperature falls and snow builds up. Squirrels are our most familiar and relatively common animals to meet. But we don't know much about this animal. It is becoming clear that the Korean peninsula is inhabited by unique squirrels, which are nowhere else in the world. Nonetheless, squirrels have recently exported millions of them as pets, and have become a major problem with invasion of Lyme bottles. Korean and foreign researchers will explore the origin and ecology of squirrels. Squirrels are native to the peninsula (dark parts) and introduced areas (light parts). Source : Squirrels from Northeast Asia, to northern China and Eurasia. Squirrels on the Korean Peninsula, corresponding to the southern tip of such a large distribution area, have been known to be unique in shape and behavior. A series of recent molecular genetics studies have shown that squirrels on the Korean Peninsula are more likely to live separate lives. This means that the common squirrel is a native species of squirrel that is not anywhere in the world. Korean and Russian researchers, including Lee Moo-young, a researcher at the Korea Wildlife Institute in Seoul National University's veterinary school, found that they conducted their first analysis of Korean and Russian mutations in 2008 under the Korean and Russian authorities. "" The difference in mitochondria cytocrome ratios indicates that squirrels on the Korean Peninsula can stay new throughout the day, "" researchers said. "" To identify new strains, such as the nuclear genome sequence. "" Afterwards, Professor Goh Heung-seon of Chungbook University (present professor emeritus at Chungbuk University) analyzed nuclear DNA to support the possibility of squirrels on the Korean Peninsula throughout the day, and Russian scholars confirmed the differences in morphology. However, the lack of research on North Korean squirrels was a huge limitation. Squirrels looking for food. Shot them in Hongcheon, Kangwondo. Jongryul professor Jeong Jong-ryul, who is affiliated with Chongryon, a reporter at Tokyo University of Chosun, gave a breakthrough. The samples of the North Korean squirrel were given to the team of professors at the University of Dong-in. The team conducted the study with the support of the Ministry of Education and Science, titled, "" The difference in the comparative system between the Northern European squirrel species and the three animals "", and "" The genetic structure of some squirrel populations in China "" was clearly identified by the neighboring China. Interestingly, the distribution boundaries between the continental squirrel and the Korean squirrel were not the Amnokgang and Dumangang. Contrary to initial estimates, the boundaries have been further lowered to the Yanggangdo and Jagangdo provinces, Lee said, As a result, North Korea is living in two continental and continent-shaped states. Of course, more North Korean specimens need to be examined to determine the final status of indigenous species on the Korean Peninsula, and if a mixed-forming hybrid has occurred between the continental and the Korean Peninsula. The impact of the Korean Peninsula's squirrels becoming different species is seen by scientists as an iceberg. The squirrel isolated in shelters such as inland of China and the Russian Far East during the Ice Age was able to keep its differences in the Korean peninsula by extending its habitat during the interglacial period. Dr. Lee's team's research revealed that the time of such differentiation was between the Ice Age and 3 million years ago, and that there were at least two shelters in the South. Most of all, the finding that the genetic patterns of squirrels differ materially in South Korea, either in the north, middle or southern regions. The squirrels in these areas are unique because they are isolated for a long time and have since undergone a different evolutionary path. If they are caught, sold or released in Busan, the two genetically separated groups will have to mix, he said. Korean squirrels, cute in their movement and appearance between Europe, have been exported to pet stores since the 1960s. It is only recently that the biological value of squirrels on the Korean Peninsula has begun to be revealed. Squirrels were currently designated as wild animals by the Ministry of Environment and were not allowed to catch or steal, but were still a strong export item until the 1980s. 655 squirrels from Gangwon Province began exporting as pets to Japan in 1962 for $ 1 per tree, and 300,000 in 1970. When overfishing was a problem, in 1971, the government limited squirrel exports to 100,000 per year and allowed the capture only for export, so the artificial breeding of squirrels was booming. Eventually, the Forest Service banned squirrel hunting in 1991. The bad results of the long export of squirrels on a large scale began to emerge. Squirrels are growing too much in Europe and are becoming a problem. Squirrels are one of Europe's top 100 invasion of the world. People who got tired of keeping squirrels as cute pets released them, opened them up, or escaped from the park. According to the European Union's database of invasive species, squirrels make up a wild group in 22 European countries. Eleven of them are in France, and others are easily seen in the forests and urban parks of Italy, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Belgian government nuri restaurant leading the squirrel to an exotic species. It is recognized that it is spread over a large proportion of the land. France estimates 100,000 people live in the North alone, including Paris. Brussels, Belgium, released 17 to the park in 1980, blowing it to 20,000 in 20 years. Squirrels are recently recognized for their ability to carry the lime-causing borelia bacteria because they have become a major host. In a paper published in the January 2013 issue of the journal Flosswone, by Maursot and others at the National Institute of Agriculture, squirrel species near Paris traditionally had a host of mites. As ill luck would have it, all squirrels in France and other European countries are from Korea. In a paper published in the 2013 journal Biological Intrusion by Venoa Pisano and other French biologists, five of France's crop-like colonies of squirrels and other native animals were caught in 11 places Researchers have estimated that the reason why squirrels are so popular in Europe is because they are so adaptive species, but research has shown that dozens of individuals living on the Korean Peninsula, the most diverse region in the world, are surprised by their success. Squirrels prefer night to acorns : the friendly but unknown ecosystem of squirrels who gather on trees by placing fallen leaves one meter from the ground and gather fruit. Squirrels were also small, not to mention storing seeds and acorns. Supplied with a clip art Korea, the squirrel will be busy collecting acorns before hibernating! Needless to say, there are many forests of oak trees with acorns open. However, actual field studies have shown different results. Squirrels prefer night to acorns. Cho Young-seok, a researcher at the National Institute of Biological Resources, found in Hongcheon, Gangwon Province, that the percentage of fruits from squirrel oysters was overwhelming 77 percent at night. After that, 12.1 percent of Mongolian oak acorns and 2.1 percent of bernorang seeds went to China. It was unexpected because the forest is predominantly Mongolian and has a lot of Mongolian oak trees and sparsely dotted wild chestnut trees, Cho said, probably because the chestnut side is high in calories. Squirrels can climb trees, but they sleep in burrows underground. Even the hibernation is under the ground. According to Cho's research, the squirrel's oysters were nearly one meter deep, divided into a bed, a bathroom, a food storage area, and connected to a tunnel. It is commonly known to have the effect of forgetting where the squirrel hid the food and therefore spreading the seeds. In response, Cho said, It is a myth, but it does not seem to be the case with squirrels. Unlike the greensand that buried the fruit here and there, the squirrel stored its fruit deep in one place, but it was too deep to sprout. The structure of the squirrel cage. N is the nest, L is the bathroom, and C is the feeding store. Source : Dr. Cho Young-seok (2014) says the liverators dug up the squirrel's store and ate the hidden fruit. How many fruits have you stored? There is quite a lot of fruit stored, Cho said. We have fallen leaves on the floor and piled them carefully, not only with a variety of fruit but also small seeds piled up, which was more than a regret. Chinese squirrels reportedly have been pre-treatment when storing berries, such as eating them to prevent buds from appearing. Would Korean squirrel do the same thing? We have slept with the acorns separated from the pod, but we don`t do any procrastinating, Cho said. As with other wild animals, Korea has few squirrel researchers. According to the field study, squirrels in the Hongcheon area hibernate from mid-December to the end of March. But the squirrel's hibernation is a fake hibernation device that begins immediately to wake up when the temperature increases, unlike bats, who almost stops metabolism, Cho said. A stored fruit is food when it wakes up. The National Bio-resources Association is set to launch a civilization-participated study next year, judging that it lacks basic research on squirrels. Because squirrels are distributed throughout the country, when you let mountain climbers put their observations of squirrels into mobile phone applications, they will be ' all over the country '"

'' Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone X (Ten) was opened to customers. Most of the customers I met on the scene were loyal customers who had been using Apple's iPhone for a long time. They said, "" Neither the high price of the iPhone X nor the M shape of the top design (notch) is a problem.

At the opening ceremony held at the KT Gwanghwamun Building on the same day, 100 customers lined up against the iPhone X in the cold weather from early morning, heating it up. At the opening ceremony, the clients said, "" I am loyal to Apple because I have insisted on the iPhone. "" During the opening ceremony on July 3, many customers said they chose to use an iPhone instead of another smartphone. Apple mania appears to have jumped iPhone 8 and picked iPhone X. Having been on site for 6 nights and 7 days since July 18, Sohn Hyun-gi (26), who has been using the iPhone's new iPhone 3GS standard and has been using the iPhone for 8 years now. Design designer Park Tae-hun (33) says, I have used the iPhone since 3GS, and I work for Apple for all my products. We also use Mac products to work on the design, and an iPad to show the finished design. The iPhone X continued its sales spurt on pre-selling, although it was the highest price ever. Customers who met on the spot also stressed, "" Price is not a big variable. "" Kim (33.), who said he started using the iPhone 4 and said, "" Considering that prices have gone up a lot, I didn't think it would make a big difference, "" adding, "" I don't think of cards or other benefits. "" Private businessman Park Jae-seong, 40, stressed, "" The iPhone X has a big screen and many extra features compared to other iPhones.

A military source said yesterday, "" North Korea has recently changed all its guard at the Joint Security Area and reprimanded the commanders in succession for failing to stop the North Korean soldiers from defection. "" North Korea's Joint Security Area is known to have 35 to 40 soldiers, including officers. On July 13, the two soldiers followed North Korean soldiers who tried to defect from the border area (MDL) and baptized 40 rounds of artillery shells. Other sources said, "" North Korea defines the incident as a major disloyalty to military discipline and to Kim Jong-un, and could carry out an exemplary purge and intense punishment. "" It was also discovered that the defectors closed down the 72-hour bridge, which was carried by a military jeep. At that time, the soldier drove a jeep with more than 70 kilometers per hour through a North Korean checkpoint and approached the MDL for 72 hours. Built on the west side of the Panmunjeom in Sacheon, North Korea built the bridge to replace the closed bridge after the DMZ axe crime in August 1976. It was named because North Korea built it in 72 hours. North Korea is expected to install a locked door to control the vehicle and its human resources.

"Global telecom chipset and patent licence operator Qualcomm Inc. was fined a record 1.03 trillion won by the Fair Trade Commission. / News 1 DBP and News 1 Park Ji-hye's Qualcomm Fine…Provide into the Treasury Exportant is a large case by which the FTC alone faces a large case and its budget security system is enforced (Article 1) and Choi Kyung-hwan, a reporter of the Financial Management Committee is charged (Article 1) In the lawsuit, which will be concluded as early as next year, the commission will have to pay more than 1 trillion won in principal refunds alone. If the antitrust regulator runs out of tax revenues, it could be the first time it has to come up with government measures to deal with the problem. As of August 24, Qualcomm paid the FTC 1.5 trillion won in fines this year, which amounted to 1.3 trillion won. However, all of the money will go to the national treasury after this year's settlement. If the FTC loses the case next year or two years later, it will have to make up for the refund with the tax revenues imposed on the year. However, the amount of penalty income usually does not exceed one trillion won. Tax revenues from 2013 to 2016 were between 550 billion and 760 billion won. The commission says the complaint is prolonged and is not an immediate issue. But the National Assembly's political affairs committee also raised the possibility of a return to the financial burden in February 2018 by announcing the court could pass a year and three months in cases of the seven liquified-fueled gas suppliers, a probe by the National Assembly. The problem is the amount of additional money. As the ICT industry develops and the Korean economy expands, international cartel disputes are growing. Qualcomm's penalty of 1.03 trillion won is the highest ever. It is four times the maximum amount of 250 billion won just before that. If the Fair Trade Commission loses the lawsuit, it can take several years to pay back the fines and the additional cost.Even in the past large fines cases, the commission had a hard time raising the refund. It took the commission an average of 130 days to pay back the fine after losing four major cases in 2015 and 2016. The total refund is 440-720 billion won. As the commission paid a delayed payment due to insufficient tax revenues, the refund amount amounted to 2.47 billion won. The largest fine before the Qualcomm`s case in January this year was an unfair joint venture by oil product manufacturers in 2015. The Fair Trade Commission lost the case, and the penalty refund amount was 254.8 billion won. When the commission was unable to pay the money due to the amount of fines collected that year, the payment was delayed. It took 159 days to pay off the entire refund. The additional interest rate of 1.6 %, which is the additional rate of the legal refund, was added to the losses of the national treasury of 1.42 billion won. Last year, ramyon producers and sellers colluded to pay a fine of about 124.2 billion won, which took 155 days to pay back, and delayed the total payment of 871 million won. ■ News 1 ~ If large fines are to be refunded by designers, it is a matter of system that the FTC can not afford to pay. Under the National Treasury Pay Act, the refund of fines is to be made available with collected fines income. There is no additional budget to prepare for a refund of fines. There is not enough money available. Normally, it did not matter because the refund of the surcharge was less than the collected in the year. Rather, it turned over the extra fines income to the national treasury, which helped the nation's imports. However, it is time to take countermeasures as the amount of excessively increased and companies are responding actively to lawsuits. The government's estimate of tax revenues released by the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) every year is meaningless in the face of such a huge incident. Tax revenues are estimated by averaging the highest and lowest income for the past five years, but it will be difficult to deal with any refunds of 1 trillion won."" Of course, we have to win the case at Qualcomm, but if we lose it, we couldn't afford to discuss it with the Fair Trade Commission budget, "" a FTC official said, adding, "" It is possible that the ministry has no other option now.

"Talk to the NYT columnist … "" rumors of purification, "" The determination of a pure father, "" and "" The majority of the arrested princes were pledged to take back their loyalty pledges … The majority of the royal family members … "" (Yonhap news agency, Mohammed Jae-hyun, 32) recently arrested. The New York Times, a U.S. daily newspaper, reported on July 23 (local time) that columnist Thomas Friedman interviewed Prince Mohammad in the Saudi capital of Riyadh for about four hours. In an interview, the Prince Mohammad said it is `` outrageous '' to comment as Roh Rim-soo, who seeks to seize power in anti-corruption activities. He went on to emphasize, "" Most of the royal family members support me, "" saying, "" The celebrities in charge of the Ritz-Carlton hotel have already publicly pledged their loyalty to him and to the reform. "" And Prince Mohammad said the nation has suffered a lot from corruption since the 1980s, saying, About 10 percent of the government`s spending is spent every year, according to experts ` estimates. `` The government has been waging a ' war on corruption ' over the years, but all failed. It was all bottom-up. "" They claim that the top-down work led by the Prince, the key figure in power, is effective in fighting corruption. Prince Mohammad of Saudi Arabia explained, "" The purge is thoroughly prepared under the direction of King Salman. "" King Salman insisted, "" After being in the clean and jerk for nearly 50 years, he made a courageous decision to break off all corruption when oil prices dropped in 2015. "" "" My father issued the first order in early 2015 to gather all information on corruption in the top tier, "" Mohammad said, "" and the team involved collected the most accurate information over two years and listed 200 people. "" Regarding the actions the prosecution took on the arrested prince and the wealthy, he said, We admitted about 95 percent of the files as soon as we showed them. However, one percent of the arrested figures were acquitted, and 4 percent were not found guilty of corruption, so they will go to trial with lawyers, Prince Mohammad said. He argued that under Saudi law, prosecutors are operating independently without outside interference. When asked how much money the prosecution would take back, he answered approximately $ 100 billion (about 108 trillion won). His Saudi anti-corruption committee arrested and investigated about 200 people earlier this month, including princes, former and present ministers and businessmen. As for a series of reform measures, including allowing women to drive, Crown Prince Mohammad said, "" Don't write that we rediscend Islam, "" adding, "" There was a music concert hall between the prophets and the men. "" It also denounced Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei as "" Hitler of the Middle East. "" "" European history shows that the oil policies do not work, "" he said.

"" nojae@yna.co.kr As long as we have the right apartment, we'd like to have a better apartment, "" said a reconstruction union at Gaepo Jugong Apts. Like Banpo Jugong 1 (Unit 1 (Master Nov·4) under construction by Hyundai Engineering & Construction), the company wants to build an advanced community facility and invite famous overseas design firms to participate. We will make some changes after consulting with the construction company before the costs do not grow excessively, an official at the union said. As the fashion designs are becoming popular recently, major reconstruction organizations are saying they will change their designs to become high-end apartments. This is because they believe that the transformation into luxury apartments while rebuilding will improve the image and, most importantly, will lead to higher housing prices in the future. Some believe the move could cause prices to rise and stimulate the surrounding markets, contributing to the overall rise in housing prices. ○ Design Change request is at the highest level according to real estate industry on Nov. 23, the Reconstruction Association of Samsung Corporation and Hyundai Industrial Development Co., builders of Jamsil Jinju Apartment in Songpa-gu, Seoul, requested a specialized design application last month. It was Miseong and Chrova apartments right next to Lotte Engineering & Construction Corporation on July 11. Lotte Engineering & Construction pledged to build three Sky Bridges linking the two very high rise and high rise bridges and build differentiated community facilities. After watching the movie, our members also began to voice their desire for a specialized design involving Skybridge or an overseas designer, said Jamsil and Jinju Reconstruction Association President. The union is scheduled to discuss the design changes with the contractor. The contractors GS Engineering & Construction has also accepted the request to change their designs. GS Engineering & Construction, in collaboration with global architectural design firm SMDP and global landscaping firm SWA, decided to design the exterior and landscaping of the complex. In addition, the system will provide clean air at the level of semiconductor clean room and IoT system to be applied with voice to control lighting and heating. The desire to build a new building was sparked by the "" Banpo Jugong "" site that the contractor selected at the end of September. Since it is a large project worth 10 trillion won in total construction costs, construction companies have put their lives on the line and proposed to the union a specialized design on the level of high-end hotels. The union's choice, Hyundai Engineering & Construction, has teamed up with global design firm HSK, suggesting unique exterior designs modeled on the Han River's wave and an indoor pool of ice water pools, or an indoor swimming pool that appears in contact with the sky. ○ There are concerns about worsening business conditions due to excessive refinement, but some say it could lead to a burden on members of the union and an increase in the average apartment price. Critics say participating in renowned Korean architects overseas is causing them to write excessive name prices. Currently, the complexes under discussion are expected to review possible measures within the cost of the existing construction, but many say that it is difficult to avoid a certain level of cost increase. Professor Lee Chang-moo of Hanyang University, pointed out, "" Too much sophistication can lead to increased business risks and negatively affect members of the union. "" Construction companies are under increasing pressure. A construction company official said, We are concerned about how much more special we should give out here when big businesses such as Apgujeong-dong and Daechi-dong are ready to build.

"[Most of the major cultural assets in Seoul, Buyeo, and Gyeongju are in danger of being "" destroyed "" in the earthquake, and Kim Jong-jin, head of the Cultural Heritage Administration of North Gyeongsang Province, was evacuated by the earthquake on July 16. Photo : Cultural Heritage Administration Korea is no longer an earthquake safety agency. The earthquake in Gyeongju and Pohang last year also shook Korea`s thousand-year-old cultural assets, including Cheomseongdae and Seokguram, nearby. Fortunately, there was no damage that could have led to the collapse, but most major Korean cultural assets need to be managed due to the high risk of damage or collapse in the earthquake. According to the Cultural Properties Administration on July 24, the National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage (CHA) established "" Seismic and Flood Risk Assessment and Management System, "" which starts with 175 cultural assets (21 national treasures, and 49 treasures) that were discovered in Seoul, during 2009-2013. The earthquake risk of cultural assets was calculated based on the types of cultural assets, accidents, repair records and ground information. It was revealed that the magnitude of an earthquake belonging to the ‘ Risk ’ class, where structural damage on a building was initiated, such as cracks on a wall or deformation of a structure, starts to be damaged from 4.5 to 6.0, with the most cultural assets starting to be damaged from 4.9. The magnitude of the earthquake, which could lead to catastrophic damage to cultural assets, ranges from 5.1 to 6.6 million square meters, with the largest number of cultural assets being 5.6. "" The data used in the research were not based on the general architecture type of cultural assets and the geographical average, so it is not an earthquake disaster of magnitude 5, "" an official at the Cultural Heritage Administration said. Cultural Properties Research Institute researchers at the National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage conduct an investigation into the damage caused by a strong earthquake in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province yesterday.In Gyeongju, 5.8 earthquakes followed 5.1 on the Richter scale on July 12. / Photo = For example, Cheomseongdae is based on general geographic information of Gyeongju, not on geographic information within a few kilometers of its construction site. In addition, he explained that he did not consider detailed construction elements such as well chisel (#) shaped crystal stone that strengthens the vibration tolerance of Cheomseongdae. Cho Sang-soon, curator at the National Research Institute of Cultural Properties, said, "" We have limits to the examination of individual elements in terms of budgets and human resources. "" "" Because of the earlier reason for the survey, the basic principle of cultural asset management is to undermine their unique value, "" However, some point out that measures to prevent cultural assets from being damaged should not be focused solely on follow-up measures. As the principle of preventing damage from cultural assets is not to be harmed, it is often to stay ex post facto, said a cultural asset disaster prevention expert. The Cultural Heritage Administration in Gyeongju, last September, strengthened disaster prevention measures against national designated cultural assets including Dabotap Bulguksa, and designated cultural assets and cultural assets by the government. In January this year, the National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage (NIRI) will establish a new safety disaster prevention lab to strengthen the safety management of cultural assets and complete a test in November that will simulate earthquakes. By 2021, it is planning to build a "" Cultural Properties Personalized Seismic Risk Map. ""What you see next door is a free comic strip and a gift batter! In addition, about 230 aircraft will be dispatched from eight U.S. air bases, and 12,000 U.S. soldiers, including U.S. Marines and sailors, will join Korean troops in training.The U.S., which has recently re-designated North Korea as a sponsor of terrorism, is seen as trying to show its strong will to punish the North for its commitment to strengthen the circulation of strategic assets around the Korean Peninsula.The Air Force announced on Dec. 24-8 that Vigilant Ace, an annual training exercise to improve the ability of the Combined Forces Command to conduct operations, will be held at air bases in Osan and Gunsan.The U.S. Seventh Air Force explained, "" Vigillance Ace is a realistic aerial combat drill, designed to increase the efficiency of bilateral cooperation and combat efficiency between the U.S. and Korea. ""The South Korean Air Force said it would take part in the exercise, including U.S. high-tech fighter jets, F-22 fighters and F-353A 3-four aircraft.U.S. Air Force officials reaffirmed their commitment to peace and security in Northeast Asia, stressing that "" the annual non-generational ace training (formerly Beverly Bulls) is to ensure a strong military alliance between the two countries and continued friendship. ""It is the first time that U.S. strategic assets F-22s and F-353A and 3-4 are deployed on the Korean Peninsula to conduct a drill to strike the North's nuclear core. The F-22 Raptors, the world`s most powerful stealth fighter jet, has 24 aircraft deployed at Yokoda Air Force Base in Tokyo and Kadena Air Base in Okinawa. It has stealth function that avoids enemy radar, and the ability to make supersonic flights is known as supercourse. At speeds of more than Mach 2.5 and with a radius of operations over 200km, one can fly from Okinawa base in Japan to Pyongyang and fly Kim Jong-un's office at once.

"On July 23, the Justice Ministry approved a rally against Jeju's naval base construction project at the prosecutors ' office to protest against the relocation of the Yongsan Fire & Marine Insurance Tower in Miryang. In an official letter sent to the prosecution on July 22, the Justice Ministry ordered a rally against construction of naval bases on Jeju Island and against the Songjeon Tower in Miryang, South Gaerasard, a protest against the fire accident at Yongsan, Seoul, to organize five specific protests. In the letter addressed to justice minister Park Sang-kee, review the contents of a special amnesty for all who is punished for alleged acts of obstruction of justice, assault, injury, protest and protest.Prosecutors criticized the Justice Ministry`s order, saying it would be a biased special amnesty tailored to the codes of the incumbent administration. It is not uncommon to grant special pardons to rally criminals with strong political colors, but to put all participants of a certain theme on amnesty. Not a few of them have been punished for the rally, and it is hard to understand why they were asked to review all amnesty. Another prosecution official denounced the move as highly inappropriate not only for simple rallies, protesters, but also for pardoning those who were punished for wielding violence. Asked whether she would make a special amnesty for former Prime Minister Han Myeong-sook and former National Assembly Member of Parliament on Christmas Day 7, she answered, "" The Justice Ministry has a specific schedule to review. "" Under the chairmanship of the Minister of Justice special amnesty is pardoned after a review by a committee is finally determined by the president. Unlike general amnesty, parliamentary consent is not necessary. Because of this, previous governments used to impose special amnesty as a political card to secure the power to operate the nation in the beginning of the administration. Lee Myung-bak, the former president is two years, four times early in his term, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, former president, former president three times, respectively, for the same period and carried out a special amnesty March 1, the fourth inning.

However, they failed to be considered for granting amnesty for crimes that hurt public safety. The campaign process, Moon Jae-in, a civic groups against the government against the Jeju naval base construction is president, pledged a withdrawal, which launched the lawsuit.Put controversial it. Among the 121 individuals that the government pointed out to be the loss of 3.4 billion won from the illegal protests, 90 percent of them were non-Japanese. Among the five groups that led the related protests, the three groups, those who hold peace and unification, are based outside of Jeju, Gyeonggi Province and North Jeolla Province. Heo Dong-jun, reporter hungry@donga.com (Pohang = Yonhap news agency) reporter Im Sang-hyeon : Pohang geothermal power plant, the first to try in Korea, was put in a quandary when some raised suspicions that it was the cause of the earthquake. It could be due to the overlap of artificial factors in natural fault activity, some experts said, pointing to geothermal power plants near the epicenter. In particular, the Korea Meteorological Administration and the Korea Institute of Geological Resources seem to have corrected the quake's epicenter to around 500m from geothermal power plants and to a depth of 3~7km, instead of 36km. As part of its project to develop saving-hour geothermal power plant, it was first promoted in Korea in 2011 in Namsong-ri, Heunghae-eup, Pohang. It is a project to organize consortium of nine organizations and companies, including Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., Korea Institute of Energy Technology, Korea Institute of Geological Resources, POSCO, Seoul National University and Nextsio, and inject 120 billion won by 2020. The first stage of the project will cost 43.3 billion won until next year to produce electricity using the heat deep under four kilometers. It is currently constructing and test-taking a 1.2.2- ㎿ plant and conducting a preliminary investigation to build power plant facilities and geothermal water circulation systems. The second-stage commercialization project is to expand geothermal power by building a 5- ㎿ plant, costing 80 billion won by 2020. If you want to turn the turbine with geothermal steam, you need to lay a deep pipeline, and the drilling process involves pouring and draining water. Some experts say the earthquake occurred on the basis of data from the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy that the Korea Meteorological Administration detected several earthquakes in nearby areas the day after geothermal power plant injected water from the end of last year. As a result, Nextzio officials said, "" We have completed drilling for two geothermal power plants from 4.2 to 4.3 kilometers underground, but have also stopped the site pressure and kept the pressure open since September 18. ""The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy formed a team to investigate geological features and seismic experts at home and abroad on July 22 and began an accurate diagnosis of geothermal power in Pohang. In addition, it decided to stop constructing geothermal power plants until the results of its diagnosis are obtained to address public concerns. Pohang City set up its own research team to investigate the incident. The research will be conducted in cooperation with geothermal power plants and researchers of geological resources to take strong legal actions if they are connected. Pohang City, gimjongsik hwandonghae a half-baked not the future strategy is ""When all recognized to piece together the relevant legal response will be."" and said, "" but people nervous.Please, please refrain from speculation. Pohang citizens are concerned about claims that geothermal power could be connected to earthquakes. `` If geothermal power is the cause of the earthquake, it could continue to happen as long as the plant is present, '' said Lee Keun-sik, a 50-year-old resident of Jangryang-dong, thoroughly examined by experts. ▶ shlim@yna.co.kr report, and article 400 air (Click!), News Channel your subscription to Starbucks coffee ssomnida Park Geun-hye said that the money in the administration received 100 million won.Free Korea Party lawmaker Choi Gyeong-hwan, 24, ahead of the public prosecutor to accusations of attendance in thought in the general meeting held at the National Assembly in Seoul. © 1 during a press ""28, summoned a suspect."" … investigate heogyeong news a news and 2017.11.24 get ankle until December 9 regular session of the National Assembly … 'nonapprehension privilege' we (= 1 News, Seoul, Korea) played by Cho Jae-hyeon.National Intelligence Service said that the money from Park Geun-hye government press reporters, iyeongjin had received a summons by prosecutors on allegations of notice summoning for Korea Party lawmaker Choi Gyeong-hwan, freedom.The prosecution implies the event of failure to comply with, ""Choi received refusing from the position no."" he said on Thursday.The prosecution has already summoned Choi as a suspect next Tuesday (July 28), a Seoul Central District Public Prosecutors ` Office official reaffirmed the plan. Choe is accused of receiving about 100 million won in special expenses from the NIS when he served as deputy prime minister and minister of planning and finance from July 2014 to January 2016. Confessing his innocence, Choi hinted that he would not respond to the summons. Speaking at a party general meeting in the morning, Choi said, It is too much to say that the current administration may go too far in its anti-political bias. If the fair investigation is secured, the suspicions will be cleared up, but it is hard to cooperate with such unfair investigation. I will discuss various things with the party leaders and the adults in the future, in effect, saying I will not respond to the summons.He said, I received an outrageous bribe from the NIS when three former NIS chiefs were under investigation for paying special expenses to the presidential office, accusing me of accepting bribes from the NIS. However, if Choi raises a biased investigation and sticks to his non-recalling stance, the prosecutors ' concerns could worsen. As the regular parliamentary session closes Dec. 9, it is not easy to investigate an incumbent lawmaker on a planned investigation if he refuses to be summoned. The National Assembly needs to approve a mandatory investigation, such as a warrant of arrest for Choi, according to the constitutional privilege of parliamentary lawmakers not to be arrested. Article 44 of the constitution says that no lawmakers will be arrested or detained without the National Assembly consent during their term, except in cases where they are current criminals.Choi said, I have even searched the main server of the National Assembly and found myself exposed to the power of the independent prosecution. We should unite to stop any political maneuvering and repression of the opposition parties.

"Choi Hae-min, reporter of the Medical Service Department, Su-Sun, and Hae-ho were found to have defected to the North via the Joint Security Area on July 24 and found out to have been shot.Professor Lee Guk-jong of Seoul National University's Regional trauma center, which will be briefed on July 22, moved a 24-year-old North Korean defector to a hospital in Aju University, Gyeonggi Province. The hospital had planned to move her to a general hospital at the end of the week, but decided that she could stop treatment of intensive care units because she had been in a stable condition without fever recently. The medical team will monitor Oh further and discuss the condition with the authorities before moving to the military hospital. Professor Lee Guk-jong is very relieved to hear from the media recently after treating North Korean defectors, said an official at the University of Aju Hospital in an interview. Oh was shot by North Korean soldiers at 3:30 p.m. when he was taken to hospital at Aju University in Suwon. Having undergone two major surgeries under the supervision of Professor Lee's home, he began breathing on the morning of July 18 and regained consciousness afterwards. goals@yna.co.kr Foreign news agencies including AFP reported on July 23 that Rwanda Foreign Minister Luis Muskiwabo said on the same day, "" We can not afford to silence when human beings are being overworked and sold like livestock, "" forcing the most refugees in Africa."" Rwanda is small but it can be accommodated, "" said Minister MushI Kiwabo. Rwanda is an area of 23,638 square kilometers. It is cut between the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda and Tanzania. In Africa, it belongs to a small country. It is analyzed that the reason Rwanda has offered to accept the refugees is due to their painful history. Minister Muk Kiwabo cited political philosophy and history as reasons for accepting refugees. There was a massacre in Rwanda in 1994 that killed more than one million people. When the president died in a private jet shot down from Hutu massacre the Tutsi are Hutu. The conflict between the Hutus and Tutsis was caused by Belgian colonial rule. Belgium has reunited its already indistinguishable species to make it easier to govern, leaving a handful of Tutsis in control of a large number of Hutus. There was a tragedy in which one million people died within three months, but neighboring countries and the international community did not help. Rwanda was then as tightly isolated as the African refugee in the Human Market. The Rwanda genocide ended when the TutsI's "" Rwanda Cultural Front "" conquered the capital, Kigali in July of that year. "" The most dramatic pain and tragic deaths seen so far is the Rwanda genocide, "" Pilipo Grandi, the U.N. refugee chief, told a media outlet recently.It has been 23 years since the Holocaust, but the political situation in Rwanda is not that simple. Rwandan Patriotic Front, Paul Kagame, who led the president is more than 98 percent of the vote last August 3rd the election. He has held office for 17 years since he took power in 2000 by ousting Hutu who led the massacre, and extended his term by seven years. If he wins the presidential election, he can continue his term in office for up to 17 years by revising the constitution to allow him to run for presidency twice more. Can be the president until 2034. This latest disgrace in 37 years, comparable to the reign of Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe, a former president. Behind the evaluation that he consolidated Rwanda after the massacre to heal wounds and lead to stable economic growth, critics say, he has carried out authoritarian politics that has oppressed dissidents and the media.

"[Dong-Hae Center's Tears] If you've ever seen a helicopter die in the hospital when you couldn't stop caring for a patient ... Last winter, a trauma nurse at the hospital's Regional trauma center, Song Seo-young (left), is performing resuscitation last winter by bringing in patients who can not breathe from the coast of South Gyeongsang Province. `` Why did my heart stop when my body was still so warm? '' cried a 30-something man, who locked me in a trauma ward at a hospital in Aju. She was the father of a 5-year-old who fell from a high position last month and rushed to the trauma center but died before being able to get to the operating room. Trauma officer Song Seo-young (36, female) shook her fist to hold back her tears, saying, ' Don't fall down in front of a patient's family. ' He later realized that he had bruises on his knee while transferring patients. Song, who delivers patients by helicopter and does emergency resuscitation at long intervals, suffers from mental as well as major injuries. At a news conference on July 22, the head of the hospital's regional trauma center in Aju University, who recently rescued a North Korean soldier who was shot to death during a defection, said one of the "" seriously ill people "" in a transportation helicopter. There are 125 nurses who work exclusively in intensive care units and general room at the hospital's local trauma center. Nurses work 13 hours a day and rest 11 hours a day to care for 100 critically ill patients who are in danger. Song has been at the scene of a struggle with Professor Lee since the center was established in 2010. The helicopter ride is always like walking on ice. That is when they brought in male patients in their late 40s who had fallen from a construction site in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province. The patient was put on the respirator as soon as he arrived at the scene. Then it began to rain cats and dogs. He had to fly the helicopter again to save the patient, although he could not see 100 meters ahead. Song, who started her career as a nurse in an intensive care unit in surgeons in 2003, had to leave the hospital once due to severe stress. I never meant to go back. However, after the birth of her first child in 2009, she could remember her former days of care more often. A man in his thirties who passed away leaving a baby, a crying wife holding him .... Song returned to the hospital the following year. The biggest support is the presence of trauma center colleagues and two daughters. After doctors fully revise patients who had little breathing, their hearts become swollen. Even when she broke her promise with the children to take care of the emergency patients, the 5-year-old barely cheered up with her second dignified word. "" It's okay, Mom, I brought people home. "" ▼ (The government is struggling 13 hours a day … The government has cut down 13.2 billion won, ▼'s most shunned work force. Because of the lack of manpower, they are suffering from severe workload. Few nurses have stayed at trauma centers for more than seven years, like Song. Even when applicants come to Korea after a long time, they often stop in three days due to the shock of being faced with reality. Nurses often hurt patients while transferring or performing surgery. When removing surgical instruments from a high-pressure steam sterilizer whose internal temperature is up to 180 degrees, they are often burned. It is also common for patients to get HIV, hepatitis B and the germs of infections through blood during surgery. One day, when they are out of breath, they can not even mention that they have tuberculosis in their lungs. However, health insurance judges often take a breather by claiming health insurance premiums after using HIV kits, as an unnecessary check, said the panel. A broken heart lasts longer than a broken body. When a patient who is taking care of him ends up dying, he or she feels guilty about it. It is worse when the patient is the same age as the child or similar to the parent. One district trauma center said, "" When we examined the risk of PTSD, most of our nurses needed psychological therapy. "" Doctors at the local trauma center are rushing patients arriving at Busan Hospital by helicopter. According to the Health and Welfare Ministry at Busan National University Hospital, 591 nurses are currently in charge of nine local trauma centers nationwide. They need to take care of up to 708 patients at the same time. Even if all nurses work 24 hours a day, it means that they can not keep up with advanced countries such as the U.S., which has 0.7 patients per nurse. It is also too much to handle in keeping the national standard of the hospital, which has a loose proportion of patients to nurses in the intensive care unit of 1.2 and 2.2 patients in the general ward. The intensive care unit of Mokpo Hospital's Korean Hospital district received a grade 6 rating, as its number of nurses (19) who were assigned to intensive care was lower than 20. The hospital is the only hospital with the highest rating in both intensive care units and general rooms. Experts say that the government has no support system at all as a key cause of the shortage of nurses. Once designated as a regional trauma center, the government will provide 120 million won per person in annual salary to each designated specialist. However, there is no wage to pay for nurses who are in charge. Under these circumstances, the government's budget for emergency medical care has decreased. According to the ministry`s next year`s government budget, emergency medical spending on medical care in areas with severe trauma services and the nurturing of emergency medical institutions in vulnerable regions was cut from 125 billion won this year to 118.8 billion won next year. The ministry's overall budget increased by 6.57 trillion won, but most of the money was spent on the establishment of child benefits and an increase in basic pension. The subsidy budget for psychiatric training was also reduced from 3 billion won to 2.4 billion won to attract physicians who avoid emergency medicine and trauma. Lee Kook-jong, a professor at the Korea Institute of Foreign Affairs, pointed out that the phenomenon of avoiding a large-scale trauma can disappear only when sufficient compensation is given to nurses of the center who are suffering from severe personal, physical and psychological harm.　Cho Geon-hee, journalist of Dong-Yang Ilbo, Dong-dae Ilbo, SOONDong-so-Only, and Facebook becom@donga.com As Professor Lee Guk-jong of Aju University, a North Korean defector who collected soldiers from the South, complained of a shortage of human resources and funeral expenses, Cheong Wa Dae's request to support the local trauma center immediately rose to second on the list. We will consider measures to strengthen and normalize the trauma center function, a presidential official said in a petition to support local trauma centers. The petition titled "" Additional System and Environmental Aid for Regional trauma Center "" was recommended by more than 150,000 people as of 10:00 p.m. on July 17 (about 530,000 persons) for its protest against Cho Doo-soon. The number of credit card users has doubled in a day compared to what 70,000 people had recommended by the previous morning.Cheong Wa Dae is pushing for a review of support measures for the local trauma center, even if the minimum number of recommendations that the minister of the relevant ministries has to answer does not reach 200,000. The reason is that the 100 major national tasks announced by the Presidential Advisory Committee on National Policy Planning, including the expansion of the regional trauma center, are needed. Nine trauma centers have been designated to provide immediate treatment to emergency patients who received car accidents or crashes. However, many of them are in poor conditions, such as not meeting the human resource standards of having at least 20 specialists exclusively for the department. The fundamental problem is that although we are providing some of our operating expenses with the national finance, we are losing money by operating them. How to improve the financial support and transfer system for the traumatic patient is the key, explained the official. Mun Byeong-gi weappon@donga.com According to the Asahi Shimbun, a police report was made at around 11:25 p.m. the previous day that a suspicious person was reported at the Nanjo Marina, a shipping port in the town of Yuri Honjo. Police who were called in were found at the scene of the incident with eight unidentified men, who reportedly told the police they were from North Korea. All eight were in good condition, and a 20-meter-long wooden boat was also found near the nearby coast. Considering that the wooden vessels with the boats have many lights on them, it is likely that they are fishing boats that can catch squid (North Korean octopus) at night. In addition, the testimony of defectors indicates that the non-family members of the North Korean family were adrift due to the low possibility of escape, but it is likely that the exact information was confirmed after investigation. National Security Council Chairman Hachiro OkonogI told a news conference after a Cabinet meeting whether the vessel broke down due to operations (near Japan) and whether the boat was drifting. yuncho@newsis.com>"
