"A 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit New Caledonia, South Pacific. (Photo : USGS) → News 1 (Seoul = News1) ; On July 20 (local time), a 7.0 earthquake of magnitude occurred near New Caledonia, South Pacific, where a tsunami was observed. According to the Pacific TsunamI Warning Center, the tsunami is heading for New Caledonia with a height of about 1m. There are also small waves expected in Vanuatu, nearby. He added that the actual magnitude of the waves depends on the coastline, and that early waves may not be the biggest.The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said Monday that a 7.0 earthquake struck off New Caledonia. The epicenter is 10 kilometers deep in the ocean, 82 kilometers east of the loyalty system. The previous record was 7.3. SOHO View News of Korean National Guard's Joint Security Council, Pyeongchang 2018 Defense Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-kyun told a regular briefing, To be clear, the three GNP chiefs and others approached the safe passage from the National Assembly by crawling to safe areas. Some media outlets reported earlier that there was no battalion commander in the footage of the North Korean defection from the truce village of Panmunjeom of surveillance equipment, and contrary to the description of the military, the battalion commander raised the possibility that the defector was not approached by crawling up front. When asked whether they brought out the fugitive, Moon answered, Yes, I was there, and I will explain the details later. We have repeatedly confirmed that the three of us, including two of our executives, were there to rescue the team under the direction of the battalion commander, he said, adding, I will explain in detail when the investigation was announced. When asked whether the battalion commander himself was negligent in transferring the defectors to North Korea, Moon said, "" I will explain the overall situation later to the battalion commander about conducting measures.

Social losses due to malicious petitions or complaints about abuse, violence, or intimidation, as well as waste of administrative power due to repeated or false petitions, are serious.Counselors agreed that the administrative power and tax waste caused by fake and repeated petitions were at a critical level. One applicant filed 25,566 repeated civil petitions at the National Archives of the People`s Rights and Rights Commission in 2006. Even though the time required to reply one complaint is 10 minutes, the same time was spent for the applicants who spent about 430 hours.The Consumer Relations Center at the Korea Consumer Agency (KCIA), which visited on July 19, contained the current state of receiving and handling complaints.

"The product store in the Pyeongchang Olympics ' headquarters in Seoul, Jamsil, Lotte World Mall, has a notice to sell the "" Pyeongchang Long Padding "" scheduled to be worn on July 22. The notice says it will sell with the warehousing times by issuing the order. [Photo : Kim Gyu-ri] The popularity of ' Long padding ' is on the rise this winter, as the cold spell continues to worsen. Created to commemorate the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, the film has become a "" precious body who can not afford to pay "" for itself by appearing on real-time search terms throughout the country and throughout the year. Some of the smaller stores have had police officers come in for customer disputes. It is a rare phenomenon in the fashion industry, which has been in a long-term slump due to sluggish consumption. According to the fashion industry on July 20, more than 50 outlets introduced padding with long sleeves that cover the knees during the past month. In addition to the sports-and-extreme brand, the company has also joined the manufacturing and distribution complex (SPA) and golf wear brands. Others say that the chronic disease of the industry, which used to be "" watching for the future, "" has reentered by jumping into the face of long padding.Kolon Sports has more than doubled the initial capacity of its long-down products over the past year. It extended its range to night trading styles, following the bench-down of its product capital, and the long-down of its hitting ticket-type. It has also introduced New Terranova Long, which has since become popular in 2013 and has since been reborn as a long-padded product.Vinfol Outdoor of Samsung Corp.'s fashion division has increased its long-padding output by 20 times from the previous year. It also plans to add items and colors to increase the number of consumer options to pre-empt market demand. Fila Korea also doubled its output of long-down jackets this year compared to the same period last year. In addition, most companies such as New Balance, Discovery, and Lecape prepare for the winter season by producing more long-padded products. The reason why fashion companies are so eager to see the longdown is because the reaction of the market has become so hot during the recession. Amid sluggish consumption, buyers often step up to the plate to ask when to get their out-of-stock products ready and find out whether to sell. As attention is focused on these companies, sales are also on the rise.Long-padded sales at Vinfol Outdoor increased by more than 300 percent at the end of last month from a year. Discovery Express posted 4.4 billion won and 5.6 billion won in sales on July 5 and 12, respectively. The figure shows that the figure has grown by more than 180 percent compared to last year. It broke the record for the second straight weekend of sales this month when the cold spell began.Since the launch of the women's long padding program, Red Face has sold 300 percent more in a row. However, some are concerned about the intensifying competition with similar brands pouring in. They are concerned that the nightmare of the onetime ' Premium Heavy Down ' might be revived. The burden of inventories failing to predict demand went entirely to outdoor companies. Companies that were anxious about inventory were cut 80 to 90 percent off, and did not worry about running out of stock."" As winter season is 30 to 40 percent, if you are cautious about the long padding market, you are going to have to jump in and see a chance that every brand is going to make you laugh, "" an industry insider said. "" But if brand is just as dull, you are going to buy a product with a brand.[Digital New York Bureau's Kim Kyu-ri] : Unrestrictable premium reading material over news from today's news agency. Choi Kang-yeol, a research team at Yonsei University, announced that they have discovered CX XC 5 danbaekjjil protein, which controls the wint signal transmission system to curb hair production, and they are developing renewable hair growth technologies. Wint Signal Transfer System is an important signaling system to control various physiological and pathological symptoms within a cell and is a key target for the development of medications, including cancer, osteoporosis, obesity, wound healing and hair formation.The study was published on October 20 in the International Journal of Dermatological Sciences ' Investigative Dumatology. Existing hair loss treatments that adjust hair growth rates do not benefit from advanced hair loss and have the side effects of preventing male hormones, so they need a new treatment to overcome.Although Wint Signal Transfer System has recently reportedly played an important role in activating hair growth and hair stem cells, it is not known about the proteins or specific processes of controlling hair growth.The research team revealed that the XC XC-type zincfinger protei 5 protein combines with the de-shered protein to impair the activation of the winthot cell and prevents hair follicles. Dishebald is a protein that detects extracellular signals into the cell and plays an important role in the activation of the cell. We also developed a multI-plastic XC5 (and the PTD-IC) that prevents the binding of the de-sharped protein, which is ' activated by adult stem cells or mice '.Professor Choi Kang-yeol said, "" This research has led to the discovery of new proteins related to hair conditioning, and the development of new substances to promote hair regeneration by controlling them. "" The drugs developed are intended to be innovative in the tissue of bald tissue."
"[THAAD then] China Travel Courtendents…House Korean travel agency, ` Shopping Pin-Roy Boy `, is concerned about dumping tourism in China and learning English and Japanese, ` The Second Sade Travel Guide ` was not available. Since the Chinese government's "" Act on the Prohibition of Korean Wave "" last March, C Travel Agency has virtually closed down. As the two governments agreed to improve their relationship on July 31, they expected Chinese group tours to resume. However, when I met an official of a Chinese travel agency on this business trip, I was very disappointed. The reason is that the fee per person is to be raised by 50 percent from the previous 400 yuan (67,000 won) to 600 yuan (100,000 won). According to the Korea-China Free Trade Agreement, domestic travel agencies can not directly attract Chinese tourists there. Against this backdrop, Chinese travel agencies are demanding an excessive fee for their travelers. A representative of the travel agency said, Chinese travel agencies have personally identified how seriously Korean tourism and distribution industries are affected by the ban. It is as if he is using his guts to make such weaknesses.Travel agencies in Korea and China are in a serious imbalance. For example, a Korean travel agency will sell travel packages to Chinese for 250,000 won to Jeju Island's three nights and four days. You can only sell to China Travel Agency. Korean travel agencies pay 250,000 won for travel packages to Chinese travel agencies with a certain amount of commission for the guest. Chinese travel agencies take the money and pay only airfare (around 150,000 won) and visa issuance fee (about 50,000 won), and everything else is taken care of. Korean travel agencies pay for all of the accommodation and transportation incurred during the Jeju vacation. Such losses would make the Chinese tourism product a "" minus tour. ""Korean travel agencies make up for losses with shopping fees (rebates) from duty-free stores and specialty stores. Travel agencies receive 20 percent of the tax money from large duty-free shops, and about 40 percent of the tax money at small and middle-sized duty-free stores and specialty stores. A travel manager in Mapo-gu, Seoul, said, "" To avoid losing money, you should shop for at least 1.5 million won per Chinese tourist. "" "" If you have to pay more than that, you'll have to pay more. ""A Chinese who experienced dumping tours would not have a good impression of Korea. Last year, the return rate of Chinese tourists to Korea was 29.5 percent, far lower than that of Japanese tourists (74.1 percent). A representative of a travel agency in Seocho-gu, Seoul, said, "" I prepared a 3.5-million-won tourist course with beauty and fashion, but I was not shunned by Chinese people who were tired of dumping traveling in Korea, and Chinese travel agencies also sold my products. ""◇ English and Japanese language guides = As such, the Chinese translator and guide who experienced difficulties due to the prohibition, is also anxious. It is because of anxiety that Chinese tourists may lose their presence again. A Chinese travel guide, who has five years of experience in writing, took the English travel interpreter's test last September. Since March, the number of Chinese tourists who visit the country has decreased sharply, leaving them with little guidance for nearly six months. I made a living by driving a car, working at a restaurant, and other work. The guide said, China may restrict Korean tourism in the future. I will never concentrate on Chinese tourists again, and receive guests from various nationalities, ''Many Chinese guides are eager to obtain certificates for their English and Japanese guides. In the test, which was held in September this year, 1,466 people applied for English, up from 937 in 2014. The number of applicants for Japanese was around 500, similar to the past. Meanwhile, the number of Chinese applicants stood at 2808, a decline from 9639 in 2014 to a quarter. Instead, English and Japanese cities saw their enrollment increase 20 percent from last year, said one director of a private think tank in Jung-gu, Seoul. Fourteen out of the 80 students who took English lessons at the institute are Chinese guide certificates.Some guides study Cantonese (Guangdong dialect and Chinese dialect spoken mostly by Southeast Chinese, instead of Mandarin. It is for guiding ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong or Malaysia. "" I get nervous every time I hear that my relationship is bad, "" one Chinese guide (25) said.Lee Bae-chan : bee@chosun.com][ The National Intelligence Service reported on July 20 under the National Assembly Intelligence Service that it punished Hwang Byung-seo, vice chairman of the ruling Workers ` Party, and Kim Won-hong, head of the political bureau. The authorities declined to specify when to punish them or the water level, citing that they are being checked.Hwang Byung-seo's last fruit tree orchard on September 21 was Hwang Byung-seo, who has been performing his local map like a shadow. Hwang Byung-seo, who conducted a map of Kim Jong Un's campus for revolutionary last March, was absent during his visit on July 13. However, he attended a "" 70 Anniversary Report "" meeting on May 12 at the Mankyung University Revolution School and the Kangbanseok Revolution School. It is the first time since July 13 that he was punished and suspended. The NIS wrote Tuesday a letter of apology for sending a letter of congratulation for the missile launches to a local factory or farm in Pyongyang that said, "" We are pleased to announce the death of an official of the Workers ' Party. "" North Korean leader Kim Jong-un coaches the Hwangnam Fruit County orchard on September 21. Since that day, Hwang Byung-seo, head of the National Political Affairs Bureau at the end of the left, has not been confirmed for his overseas activities. The General Government is the most powerful organization in the nation that leads the People's Army in political and historical terms. It is the key organ of the so-called "" military conscience "". Kim Jong-un has been breaking up with Grand National Party chief Lee Young-ho and his wife, Chang Song-taek, by purging and executing their own party officials. Last year, the NIS officials of the National Security Department were also purged and executed en masse. Meanwhile, the political bureau of the general government has shown no signs of a change. However, the punishment of Hwang Byung-seo and Kim Won-hong led the army → Labor Party → Information agencies → General Government. Kim Kwan-jin, then presidential chief of national security, and North Korean military chief of staff Hwang Byung-jin attended as high-level military contact delegates to ease military tensions between the two Koreas caused by North Korea's attack on a warship. If the NIS's report is true, it is considered to be a punishment for the political establishment's monopoly on the fact that former chairman Choi Yong-hae and its political director Hwang Byung-seo, who are competing for the rank of power, will not be punished. Kim Won-hong was re-revolved earlier this year when he was appointed as the national security advisor, and returned to the political bureau in April to face punishment for the first time in six months. "" Kim Jong Un has executed his uncle Chang Song-tak since he took power, and then punished Choi Yong-hae, regarded as one of the second most powerful figures, "" a government official said. "" This time, he blocked corruption by himself by using his own hands. They say that the ruling is similar to the Shim Hwa-jo case in the late 1990s, in which the police used conflict to do a massive purge. Jang was executed in the Department of Integrity after finding out about his irregularities, and late last year, punishment for the vice minister was brought about by the death of a high-ranking official of the Workers ` Party during an investigation. Kim Won-hong (right), the former North Korean national security minister, appeared at a ceremony marking the 105th anniversary of Kim Il-sung's birth on April 15 at Kim Il-sung Square as the head of the North Korean national security team. After being dismissed by the National Security Council at the end of last year, he was revolutionised and reinstated on that day. Some analysts say it is for the change of generations or for a change of atmosphere. Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korean studies professor at Dongguk University in Seoul, said, We have stabilized some degree of regime through Kim Jong-un's first year in office, possibly prompting them to play the role of a madame madame minister. Some say that it is also related to North Korea's stopping further provocations after September 15 and the budding mood of dialogue between the United States and North Korea. It might be a proactive measure to prepare for a shift in the relationship between the North and the U.S., which has been strongly opposed to the South. Most of all, North Korea experts point out that the fact that the international community is imposing strong sanctions against the North is causing the North. China, which has served as the rear door of North Korea and has played a role as the back door of the North since recently joined sanctions and began to tighten its purse strings, is a chilling situation in which residents can avoid deviation. Professor Jeon Hyun-jun at Wooseok University said, "" North Korea raises the alarm for the people by making sure to execute agricultural secretaries during times of hardship in the late 1990s. They say that they are engaged in politics based on fear of punishment, checks that lead to punishment and loyalty among power agencies, and exemplary politics that openly spread punishment for wrongdoings."

Cho Hyun-ah, former vice president of Korean Air, and Korean Air, who demanded compensation for emotional distress, also requested 200 million won and 100 million won in compensation. Korean Air responded to this by saying, "" The office certificate is assigned to all employees according to a common standard, and I have never been given an unfair case or given a disadvantage to Park.

But building piano so have a strange career with the historical significance, this Dongnimmun as the Cultural Properties the Joseon Governor-General's office after the Japanese occupation.A sum as well as repair work that he had to. Japan used a substantial budget of 4100 won to repair Dongnimmun in 1928 and designated it as Joseon's cultural treasure in 1936 and designated it as Historic Site No. 58. Why did Japan, which destroyed 90 percent of Gyeongbok Palace and even built Changgyeong Palace as a zoo, register Dongnimmun as a cultural asset and even repaired it?To track down the reason, you should go back to when Dongnimmun was built. The construction of Dongnipmun began in January 1896, when Seo Jae-pil, then a pro-American activist and citizen of Kapshin, returned to the United States to obtain U.S. citizenship. Seo Jae-pil, who was adviser to Jungchuwon at the time, began a campaign to build Dongnimmun with his colleagues in Kapshin, Park Young-hyo and Yoo Gil-jun. Yeongeunmun Gate, which was built on the site of Dongnimmun Gate before the construction of Dongnimmun. Qing Dynasty's ambassador walked into the city to symbolize the fruit and vegetables of Joseon's footbridge.(Photo : Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs blog) Back in 1896, the Joseon Dynasty was in a very strange time. Japan who won the Sino-Japanese war of pro-Japanese attacked, Japanese, the establishment of the Cabinet who assassinated the Empress Myeongseong eulmisabyeon is which committed, in February 1896, when Emperor Gojong.To the Russian legation. As soon as he was assured of his safety after the Agwan Pacheon, King Gojong immediately sent a warning to clean up the pro-Japanese cabinet, and politicians were almost entirely purged or sent abroad. As a result, pro-American groups such as Seo Jae-pil, who was at a distance from the collaborators, did not remove the building of the Independence Gate, and his movement for the construction of the Independence Gate was also of Korea, which attracted keen attention from both King Gojong and his followers. In May of that year, when the relationship between Japan and Russia improved and King Gojong's voice rose, the royal family donated 1000 won to build Dongnimmun, the royal prince of Joseon. A large number of pro-government figures entered the movement to build Dongnimmun, which established the "" Dongnimmun Construction Committee, "" which later became an independent association. The independence organization saw many liberal figures and then officials take part in establishing Seo as an adviser. Double for pro-Japanese group of people in the future, such as Lee Wan-yong, angyeongsu, the first president of the Committee also took part. When Dongnimmun started construction in November 1896, King Gojong visited the palace in February 1897 and declared the Korean Empire in October of understanding. Then in November of that year, Dongnimmun was completed. Dongnimmun was built to coincide with the proclamation of the Korean Empire by King Gojong and a series of political performances from China to the Kingdom of the Yellow Sea. To symbolize his departure from the Chinese interior, the former Qing Dynasty ambassador, Young-eun, left behind an air force station, and Dongnimmun was built. The Korean national flag carved on each side of the signboard. It is known that young students who grew up without seeing the Korean national flag during the March 1st Independence Movement referred to the national flag on Dongnimmun.(Photo : Doosan Encyclopedia) The Japanese government emphasized the image of the gate as a door to celebrate its departure from China's backward country. The reason why Joseon was liberated from China's internal ties is that the Qing Dynasty lost to the Qing Dynasty and the Blue Army was forced to leave the country. Dongnimmun was used as a symbol of the whole of extension. Dongnimmun personnel who spearheaded the establishment of an independent association also be the territories of the Japanese be some of the Independence Gate made good to use for propaganda purposes. However, there was something that the Japanese did not think of yet. The signboard of Dongnimmun was engraved with a taegeuk, which plays a huge role during the March 1st Movement. During the March 1st Movement in 1919, young students who did not know the shape of the Korean national flag were able to make it thanks to the taegeuk engraved on the Independence Gate. Regardless of how King Gojong or Imperial Japan used it, Dongnimmun was a gate to honor the national flag to the people who long hoped for independence. Lee Hyun-woo, reporter knos84@asiae.co.kr"
"The facia is estimated to have been formed as "" water out of the cracks "" by students at least 1m and 7~ 8m long. Pohang : On July 20 at 10:00 a.m. In Pohang High School, in Buk-gu, Pohang, a place that is believed to have been flooded by a 5.4-magnitude earthquake. Liquefaction is the phenomenon of the soil and ground becoming water when vibration is applied to an underground layer of sand. A day after the earthquake, a team of scientists from the Department of Health, Transport and Environment came to check for cracks in the index and found evidence of a possible liquid change. When the reporter visited the school, about 10 first grade students who had finished school were playing soccer in the playground. There were several cracks on the ground not far from the soccer goal, measuring 1m in length and 7~ 8m in length. Due to lack of control, the trail was often cleared by the flow of people and cars, which was probably caused by a gap in the soil and sand. I stepped on the cracked part. The surface area felt firm and not loose. "" There was a lot of water on the sides of the cracks at around 3:00 p.m. on the 15th, "" the students said. Estimated liquefaction marks on the pothouse playground. Packed with dirt and covered up. Pohang : Professor of Research at Professor Son's research team, who investigated the possible trace of hydroforming of the Pohang High School, said, "" Only when we learn how much water is flowing out of the gaps can we make the building's LPI distribution possible. "" When liquid material erupts into the surface and makes room underground, it causes an earth settlement, he explained. An apartment building in Songdo-dong, Nam-gu, Pohang, is believed to have been liquefied on the ground under the veranda, causing the floor to sink. In addition to the heavily damaged North Korea's media outlets Choi Eun-kyung, the city of Songdo-dong in Nam-gu, about 13 kilometers from the epicenter, was also presumed to be liquid. Right after the earthquake on July 15, sand mixed with sand rose more than 1m into the air from the alleys and road where multiplex homes were clustered, said an official of Nam-gu, where more than 25 sand was poured. The official added, We suffered severe damage from the earthquake, such as a road crack even though it was far from the epicenter. It is possible that although it is not noticeable, there is a lot of liquefaction in the downtown area, Sohn said. At the request of Pohang City Councilman Jang Bok-duk yesterday, Shim Jae-hyeon, Professor Son Moon, and Professor Kyung Jae-bok of the University of Korea looked into open land, residential areas, apartments, and parks. The reporter accompanied him. All six places had mud or sand all around them. One apartment had a badly broken veranda and concrete rose on it. As a result of visual confirmation, it is believed that the liquefaction is correct, but it is not difficult to live because it is not very liquid, Shim said. We need to examine it thoroughly and discuss to what extent the government will come up with a liquefulmation package, he added. Kyung-kyung also said, It looks like liquefaction. Experts say the quake is not far from the epicenter. More than a dozen traces of the earthquake were discovered for the first time since the earthquake was modernized near the epicenter on July 18-19 when the Korea Institute of Geology and Resources Research and Professor Son Moon and others found evidence of the earthquake. Meanwhile, the Korea Meteorological Administration, the National Institute of Disaster and Safety and an investigation team of the Ministry of Public Administration and Security conducted a joint investigation in front of a rice paddy in the main part of Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, yesterday morning to determine the effects of the earthquake. It took 400 million won to make a bank loan and sold it for 850 million won. Though it is not as bad as what the distributors said, the annual profit rate of 6 percent is not that bad, so I expected it to be around 3 million won per month in full. The store was completed in 2015, but the store that Kim received was empty for two years because he could not find a tenant. Each month, the bank paid 1.2 million won in interest alone. Earlier this month, he finally received a tenant. A deposit of 20 million won and 1.4 million won per month is enough to cover the monthly cost of interest on the bank. I will have to open my hands to my children for the time being. Behind the mall where Kim was put on sale is another major wholesale construction in the works.Due to the rising prices of large apartments and supply, the revenue-type real estate market, such as commercial and officetel stores, is likely to experience a lower return. A large shopping mall in Gwanggyo, Gyeonggi Province, had "" rental inquiry "" advertisement everywhere yesterday. Many of the most popular stores on the first floor were also empty. As the aging population of visiting journalists and the prolonged rate of low interest rates, the demand for ' real estate with rent ' has increased dramatically in recent years. Due to its popularity, the prices of apartments and supply have soared. However, the market of shopping malls and motels has recently increased by a number of signs. According to the Korea Institute of Audit and Inspection on July 19, the annual return on sales at retail outlets nationwide has dropped from 5.2 percent to 4.4 percent over the past year. Fears over an air gap caused by excessive supply are growing in some areas in the Seoul metropolitan area. Even the commercial poor, who are struggling to find tenants and stop interest on loans even after they rent. As the apartment price becomes higher, so we try to get a rental fee by raising it, and when tenants turn it away, we forget about the profit margins by creating public spaces, said a real estate expert.◇ The return rate of commercial centers decreased to 4 % on July 14, but the number of pedestrians in the streets was small, although it was lunch time between business owners and businesses near Gwanggyo Central Station in Gwanggyo, Gyeonggi-do. The busy shopping district had 60 to 70 percent of the seats filled, and many restaurants had only one to two tables. Last year, the main shopping mall, which was completed, was open to the public out of 24 stores on the first floor. When I told one authorized broker that I was at the office to look for a store, I noticed that there was a store on sale with 20 percent off the initial price. It costs 650 million won to introduce a 40-square ㎡ store. Considering the nearby rental market, the annual profit rate was only around 3 percent. If the sellers know, let the prices keep a lid on the price, so it is a hassle, said an broker, adding, Monthly rent should go up quickly because the prospects are good.However, the mood of tenants was different. A man who has been operating a hot pot restaurant in Gwang-kyo for three years demanded a 30 percent discount (to building owners) on the rent, saying, If not accepted, I will try to move out.Analysts say that the profit margins in Seoul's major business areas are also low due to the high prices of apartments and oversupply. B Building, which was built in 2014 on two sides of the road near Gangnam Station on Subway Line No. 2, has four million won in monthly rent. The average apartment price per 3.3 ㎡ in downtown Seoul went up more than 40 percent from 29.1 million won in 2013 to 41.71 million won this year. As of October, the volume of shopping malls in the Seoul metropolitan area has already exceeded 177 percent of 2013.As the volume of apartments to be sold in the next year has exceeded 70,000, the target real estate market for apartments is also feared to worsen as the supply has increased. According to the market research firm Real Estate 114, the volume of apartments has remained at around 40,000 per annum for the last three years (2015-2017). However, there will be 72,266 rooms next year and 72,598 rooms in the following year.Officetel's earnings rate has been dropping steadily since 2007. Annual profit rates at apartments nationwide dropped to 5.29 percent last September from 5.46 percent at the end of last year. In particular, Seoul saw its 5 percent decline last July, and the figure stands at 4.94 percent as of September.The National Tax Service (NTS) found that 42.5 percent of all rental enterprises are aged over 60, and 72.4 percent are those who prepare to retire when they reach the age of 50.Some also point out that the worsening profitability of shopping malls or apartments could accelerate the problem of "" collapse of the middle class's silver (aging poor) "". "" Behind the overheated property market is not the complicated link between declining retirement age, aging, low interest rates and poor welfare for the elderly, "" said Professor Shim Kyo-eong-eon of Konkuk University, who said, "" the government should focus on the real estate market as a simplified tenant.

The collection was confiscated from his home. Choi is on the track of a prosecution investigation over allegations that he received about 100 million won in special expenses from the NIS in 2014 when he was deputy prime minister and minister of financial services. Prosecutors also found out that the NIS gave money to Choe while investigating the scandal of paying special expenses to Cheong Wa Dae.

Prosecutors plan to analyze the data obtained through a search and seizure to find out whether the special investigation funds from the NIS were transferred to Rep. Choi will be summoned as a suspect soon and investigated. If prosecutors catch the evidence that Choi used for the purpose of lobbying other lawmakers after receiving special expenses for the NIS, the investigation is likely to expand into suspicions that a majority of politicians are involved. Choi strongly denies the allegation, however, saying, "" I have never received any special expenses for the NIS. "" It is New Delhi, the capital of India. New Delhi has been bathed in smog similar to ' gas chambers ' since early November, due to the deadly fine dust. Trucks turn on headlights in New Delhi, India, smog from deadly air pollution on November 8.

Some athletes wore gas masks that looked like gas masks, but the guardians said most local athletes tried out with brave faces. The air quality index (combined toxicity · fine and ultrafine dust) exceeded 1000 ㎍ ㎥ / in some parts of New Delhi on July 7. Local doctors likened to `` the toxicity of 50 cigarettes a day. '' The ultrafine dust weighed more than 710 U.S.C. 60 times the reference value for particulate 1 in the United States (12 U.S.C. / ㎥). NDTV found that, depending on the conditions of measurement, the concentration of ultrafine dust was often higher than 1000 U.S.C. Schools were closed for several days due to the continuing state of the program, and some airlines, including United Airlines, halted flights to New Delhi, causing confusion. According to the World Health Organization, New Delhi has an annual average dust concentration of 122, 1.4 times larger than Beijing's 85. However, on November 7, it soared 8.4 times higher than the Beijing average for air quality. Arvind Krmar, chief of a chest surgeon at the riverside ram Hospital, said, Many patients complained of coughing and breathing difficulties. It is the same poison that the toxicity 1000 smoked 50 cigarettes a day, said the Guardian. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) asked the New Delhi High Court to delay the marathon, saying it was in a health crisis. Marathon in the heavily polluted air can cause asthma attacks, aggravate lungs and increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. However, the court allowed the event, saying the organizers were doing all they could to ease the worries. Centre-backed telecommunications company Etel has threatened to pull out of the event unless authorities improve air quality. Organizers then sprinkled water on the course and blocked traffic during the event for six hours. Fortunately, the air quality index fell to 189 two days before the event, but rose to 238 the same morning. The guardians reported that the athletes complained of pain by saying, "" It's pissing out. "" "" I know pollution is serious and can have an effect on our health, but I took part in it to send a message to the government that we need to create an environment free of pollution worries, "" one athlete told the Guardian. Air in New Delhi is worsening due to road dust, frequent fires, car smoke, factory smoke and the flooding of agricultural residuals from surrounding rural areas. As winds die down in the winter and temperatures drop, contaminants are held close to the ground, making it worse.

"[Hankyoreh] The cash flow from suspicion in the prosecutors ' jedongu rejection of warrant related to a former senior prosecutors several times “pulled out with tweezers and dismissal” bulmanu illegal surveillance intervention of former senior secretary this week.Potential, the third summons warrant ubyeongu former presidential secretary for civil affairs is the last morning of June 6, Seocho-dong, Seoul Central District Court in misconduct and dereliction of duty for the 20th.Heading into the courtroom to attend the hearing. It was confirmed on July 19 that the warrant of a search and seizure warrant requested by the prosecution to a court to investigate corruption committed by Woo Byung-woo, former presidential secretary for civil affairs, was rejected again. The court repeatedly blocked the ruling in June from issuing a warrant to look into the phone records concerning Wu. Judge Kwon Soon-ho of the Seoul Central District Court recently requested that the Seoul Central District Public Prosecutors ' Office withdraw the arrest warrant for Kim Jang-ja, the former chief of the Supreme Public Prosecutors ' Office in Seoul. Samnam Development is a company that manages Giheung Country Club in Dongtan, Gyeonggi-do, which is owned by Woo's wife. Prosecutors initially planned to start full-scale investigation by obtaining accounting books by searching for confiscated items and finding suspicious details in the fund flow of the Samnam development project, but the prosecution was reported to have turned down the warrant. "" Woo's ` Woo ` did not even mention it, but he threw out the warrant as if he had only pulled it out with a tweezers, "" a prosecution official said. Prosecutors earlier requested a warrant to secure a call record related to Woo in June, but it was rejected continuously. Seoul Central District Public Prosecutors ` Office, Yun Seok-yeol, told the National Assembly's Legislation and Judiciary Committee on July 23, We checked who (Woo) and whom (Woo) talked to were withdrawn from the telephone call. It appears that you should not conduct such an investigation. We could not go farther. Regarding this, a prosecution official said, "" Since the records of the calls were kept for only one year and were deleted after the expiration of the deadline, we will have to check whether the calls were made before and after last October when Woo checked his other issues. "" Prosecutors recently dismissed arrest warrants by former NIS chief Lee Byung-ho, who is suspected of being involved in the scandal. The former top-ranking intelligence officials said that the money, the most amount of 2.5 billion won for Park Geun-hye, former president and a search warrant was sought and won the 500 million cost of Park Geun-hye, the poll.The government of three allegations of the heaviest, the only arrest warrants was refused. Lee is the perfect match between Woo and Lee, a prosecution official said, We wonder if we can dismiss the arrest warrant for the three South Jeolla Province presidential contenders and dismiss it as a coincidence. However, the prosecution is set to call Woo, suspected of ordering the NIS to investigate illegal surveillance by civilians and government officials in connection with its recent speeding up investigation, as a suspect later this week. Prosecutors reportedly caught Woo involved in inspections by former special inspectors Lee Seok-soo, Woori Bank Chairman Lee Kwang-koo, former chairman of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics organizing committee Kim Jin-sun, and senior officials of the Culture, Sports and Tourism Ministry. In questioning the former NIS director Choo Myung-ho, Woo called to order a background check on Lee and reported the report to Woo, which contained the status of inspection, as a secret statement. Considering that former Commissioner General Choo Chu-su, who issued a "" non-communication report "" to Wu on July 3 was arrested, it is also likely that the prosecution will ask for his third arrest warrant. Prosecutors previously requested Woo to issue arrest warrants during their investigation into the abuse of state power, but all of them were dismissed. Meanwhile, the prosecution is set to summon and investigate Choi Yoon-soo, the former deputy chief of the NIS, who is involved in Woo's alleged spying on civilians.

Only 18.9 percent answered, "" Since it raises suspicions that are not based on facts, it should be considered defamation. "" Twenty-two percent said they don't know. By age, the highest response rate was 73.5 % (age group is not defamation), followed by all 40-somethings (69.3 %) and 20-somethings (59.6 %) who were in order. Realmeter said, "" Even if we divide by gender, region, support group, and ideological orientation, it was not defamation against us.

Of course, it is the media ` role to question, said Choi Jin-hyeok, a former spokesperson for the Korean Bar Association, but the reporter judged the role of the movie as being before and after its release, not as an ongoing probe. The reporter raised suspicions that Seo intentionally caused Kim and his daughter to die in the movies and news about accusations by media outlets. Kim Kwang-seok's brother, Kim Gwang-bok, accused Seo of killing and accusing her of copyright infringement and fraud last September, and police recently conducted an investigation and concluded that she was innocent.

The leadership of the party is inspecting the military government under the leadership of Choi Yong-hae, a member of the political Ministry`s executive committee, said Kim Byeong-bul, a senior official at the briefing.It is the first time in North Korea in 20 years that the NIS is informed that political officials of the political bureau, including General Policy Bureau Director Hwang Byung-seo and Deputy Director Kim Won-hong, were punished.The NIS said, North Korean authorities are also focusing on managing the people as they expect negative repercussions from the sanctions.

Lee's mother cried aloud, "" Please don't let this happen again. "" Tears streamed down her eyes. On July 9, at around 1:50 p.m., he was practicing at a beverage manufacturing company in Yongam Marine Industrial Park in Gujwa-eup, Jeju City when he was caught in a neck in a belt of product loads. Another student, who was practicing with Minho, found Minho and informed him to rescue him but he had already lost consciousness.Minho's death was finally carried away after suffering in intensive care units for 10 days. An accident fractured the second cervical vertebrae and the sternum, and led to a lung left. This resulted in brain damage and an acute respiratory failure. The direct cause of death was multiple organ failure and cardiac arrest. Minho's mother called Minho on the last day of the accident on the 8th. "" If I had dinner and told her I had extended my work until 8:30 p.m., I wouldn't know that my mom was going to work any more. "" She asked me why I eat rice because it makes my heart hurt and angry. Minho said he ' had something to meet that day ' The machine is failing, failing, and about to stop.

The director of the funeral parlor, Kim, said, Minho's job was to monitor the flow of automation equipment, report to employees when there was an error, and also carried the license with him.As for the contract, it was to give students the same benefits as normal employees and apply welfare benefits. We reached an agreement to create jobs for Jeju Island in a really good sense, but it`s very unfortunate that it happened, the current head of the company said in a statement. It was revealed that Minho did not report to the school after the accident. The school did not take action until it received a call from another student.We could not contact the school because there was no sign of an accident, Kim explained.Other students were sent home immediately after the accident.The relocation field exercise, under the guise of education, has been a number of social issues so far.

"(Tokyo=Confederence news) Kim Byung-kyu : The Japanese government has decided to develop cruise missiles capable of ground attack, Yomiuri Shimbun reported on July 20. Japan's Defense Ministry is pushing to add a new capability to attack the ground with a Korean Air cruise missile that it plans to start developing next year. It is the first time that Japan has developed a ground cruise missile in earnest. The Defense Ministry set a goal of completing the test product by 2022 and has set aside about 77 billion yen (75 million U.S. dollars) for the budget for research next year. A cruise missile is a radar loaded to locate targets and is capable of flying horizontally with wings and engines. A typical cruise missile is the Tomahok of the United States, and the Earth cruise missile under way is called the Tomahok version, according to Yomiuri. The Japanese government is claiming to develop such a missile to capture the fallen island by the enemy, but behind it lies its re-checking and militarism. Even the purpose of the trip is to deploy a ship with a missile close to the enemy territory, so that it can be used to carry out a preemptive strike on military bases. As it happens, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces may develop a high probability of possessing the ability to hit the base in the first place when North Korea moves forward to launch a ballistic missile, or "" enemy base attack capability, "" which could lead to a cruise. However, it is inevitable that the development of land cruise missiles and the capability to attack enemy bases will have to contradict the existing constitutional interpretations that limit the activities of the SDF to all defense measures (which can be exercised during an enemy attack only). Yomiuri explained, "" The government will first concentrate on developing ground cruise missiles with an emphasis on falling down the defense, and will keep an eye on the political circle's discussion on whether to introduce capabilities to attack enemy bases. "" Members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on March 30 propose that Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have the ability to attack enemy bases.[EPA = Combined news file photo ]bkkim@yna.co.kr ▶ Report, inquiry (click!) ▶ Starbucks coffee for 400 minutes of subscription to Yonhap news channel [Seoul NewsNews) Now News], a fossil of a giant sea creature that went extinct in the 18th century.Discovered in the Doman Korskye Islands in the North Pacific North Bering Sea, the fossil's owner is the Steller Vadasso, a six-meter-long sea creature.Russian experts have regularly been exploring for archeological bones near the Bering Sea. The recent skeleton was made out of 27 sterobata bones, No highly worthy areas of study were found.Badaso is usually 10 meters long and weighs more than 10 tons with a lifespan of about 60 years.Steller Badasso lived in the Bering Sea and surrounding seas until the 1700s, but she disappeared due to reckless overfishing. Afterwards few fossils from Steller Badasso were discovered, and experts say it is valuable because the body is in very good condition and the head was not found.Researchers at the University of George Mason in Virginia who led the study found in 1741 that German explorers discovered a swarm of stellers on a voyage, with about 33 sailors on record for a single double hunt.In particular, it tasted similar to almond oil in the provinces of Vadaso, and the flesh was known to be very good, too.Historical records show that the last Steller Badasso to survive on Earth was hunted in 1768. Experts say indiscriminate hunting is one of the reasons for its extinction.The findings of the fossilized studies of the giant sea creature will be published in the International Journal of Scientific Letters, and then displayed in a museum in Russia after a restoration project. Song Hye-min, reporter of Jeongjeong News huimin0217@seoul.co.kr An official at the University of Aju Hospital in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, where the soldier was hospitalized and being treated, said on July 19 that the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and had difficulty getting blood poisoning due to the disease.The official said, Pneumonia is presumed to have been caused by a portion of the lung being damaged by a bullet wound, and blood poisoning is believed to have been affected by massive blood injections and an abdominal bullet wound. Hepatitis B is still a common disease in North Korea. If left unattended as an inflammatory disease in the liver caused by hepatitis B virus, it could lead to liver sclerosis or liver cancer. It has been revealed that 40 units of blood have been used by hospitals to treat defectors so far. Considering that the total blood flow in the human body is 4 to 6 liters, it is approximately 3 to 4 times more blood intake. According to the hospital, when the soldier arrived at the hospital, his blood pressure had dropped to 70 mm Hg or less, making it impossible to recover. "" It is amazing that the patient is coping with the situation, "" doctors said in unison. It is said that the soldier, who arrived at the hospital in a hurry, could not even do a CT scan and underwent surgery immediately. In addition, hospital officials said they had to inject type O blood into the blood type to determine it. Lee Guk-jong, a medical professor at Aju University Hospital in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, explains the patient's condition after two operations on a North Korean soldier who was shot while he defected from the country. Ahn Chul-min, a reporter at the hospital, said on the other hand, We don`t have a time to perform a third operation against the soldier who defected.

"Statistics Korea's National Statistical Office analyzes the key characteristics of the lifetime of married couples : The average age of married couples decreased by 103 years, resulting in the birth of only 4.5 children per woman → 1.9 children ··· Compared to 60 years ago, the birth time decreased by 9.2 years. The proportion of children who did not have children increased by four times. On the other hand, the average expected number of children by adding the average number of births and additional planned children was halved. Couples in Seoul, Kyung-gi and Sejong who are heavily involved in economic activities gave birth to their first children later than other cities and provinces. Statistics Development Institute of the National Statistical Office released its report on Monday on the "" analysis of key characteristics by life cycle. "" ◇ The age of first marriage is 103 years late, and the average age of married women in 2010-2015 is 29.4 years, which is 19.1 years old, the average age of women married in 1950 to 1954. The number of births has plummeted from 4.5 to 1.3 due to the delayed wedding. The average number of children to be expected to be 2.1, down from 4.5, which is the average number of births and additional planned children.In contrast, the proportion of childless women in the family has quadrupled to 2.3 percent and 8.2 percent. After the birth of the first child, the baby was born 9.2 years shorter, from 11.4 to 2.2. As they marry later and have more children and are under the burden of childcare, they stop having children after 2.2 years. However, the number of births after marriage has decreased since the mid-2000s. Women married in 1950-1954 took an average of 2.58 years to give birth to their first child, but was shortened from 1975 to 1979 to 1.5 and then increased to 1.84 in 2000-2004. However, it was shortened back to 1.68 2005 - 2009 and 1.26 2010 - 2014. While higher education and delayed marriages are cutting the average length of maternity for women, married couples are rushing to have their first child in the past, said Kim Kyung-yong, director of the office`s statistical analysis department. ◇ Higher housing prices meant the longest time between a baby's late marriage and the first child's birth (the first birth interval) was in Seoul (1.75). It followed the games (1.66), Sejong (1.63), Busan (1.61), Incheon (1.59), Daegu, Ulsan, and Gyeongnam (1.57) In terms of the number of cases, the birth interval was longer than those in Yongsan-gu, Seoul (1.94), Seocho-gu, Seoul (1.90), and Gangnam-gu (1.87) Seocheon-gun, Chungcheongnam-do (1.30) and Imsil-gun, Jeollabuk-do (1.35) were relatively short. After the birth of the first child, the birth period was 4.23 in Cheju, 3.97 in Jeonnam and 3.85 in Gangwon. Meanwhile, the birth dates of the regions with short childbirth were Ulsan (3.53), Busan (3.62), and Seoul (3.66). Kim said, "" High housing costs and active participation in economic activities by women tend to delay the first birth interval. "" "" Having a short birth period completes the tendency of having a low birth rate or a short-term birth. "" The children of the households where mothers worked were more likely to use childcare facilities and private academies than their non-business-career children. Children with working mothers spent 51.5 percent of their children at home and day care centers, up 174 percent from their non-enterprise counterparts (34.1 percent). The proportion of private education after entering elementary school was 15.3 % for 6-year-olds, much higher than their non-entrepreneured (10.5 %), as was the case of a recent pregnancy when "" career break "" was achieved.Marriage rates decreased from 70.6 percent in 1950 to 41.5 percent in 1980. On the other hand, the fertility rate stood at 14.2 percent in 1950 and 46.8 percent in 1980. Child rearing accounted for 5.1 percent of the children born in 1950 and 9.4 percent of the children born in 1980. hjpyun@newsis.comThe number one risk factor for the second half was 35 percent of household debt, which is the biggest influence on household debt problems and financial systems, said Cho Hyun-shik, a financial analyst at Seoul's Real Estate Market uncertainty. The crisis over household debt turned out to be greater than ever.The Bank of Korea's System Risk Survey, released on October 20, found that 87 percent (multiple financial) of respondents surveyed 68 financial experts from October 30 to October 6 pointed to risks related to household debt. The survey conducted in May showed that the proportion of "" North Korea-related geopolitical risks (82 percent) "" increased by 11 percent from the first half of the year. Next, the normalization of key currencies such as the U.S. Federal Reserve ` rate hikes (75 percent) was also pointed out as a risk factor. Uncertainty in the real estate market (56 percent), following a series of government regulations on the real estate market, was included as a new risk factor. The risk factors mentioned by experts as the number one reason was the highest proportion of household debts (35 percent). It was followed by geopolitical risks related to North Korea (28 percent), currency policy normalization (24 percent) and real estate market uncertainty (3 percent).Household debt problems and geopolitical risks related to North Korea are cited as the main reasons for the impact on the financial system. It was judged that the household debt problem and the uncertainty in the real estate market were medium (one to three years), in the case of the North's geopolitical risks when the risk factors occurred and the normalization of the major monetary policy.【 Seoul-Newseer : According to the Bank of Korea's preliminary report released on July 23, household credit increased by 138.1 trillion won (299.1 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of June to 138.1 trillion won (2.17 billion dollars). hokma@newsis.com however, experts said that the financial system risks would be realized in the near future. The risk of financial systems increased to 53 percent within a year, up from the previous survey of 51 percent. Confidence in the financial system's stability was also high, with 47 percent, up from the previous survey (40 percent). The survey was attended by 68 people, including the head of the local financial institution's management strategy and risk department, participants in the financial market (stocks, bonds and foreign exchange and derivatives), and investors in Korea Investment Bank overseas. hacho@newsis.com>"
"Despite the forecast of a decline in unit prices, one third of the world`s total investment in the health high places is increasing. ▽ Memory semiconductor 〓 As the world semiconductor industry is tense over Samsung Electronics ' reckless investment, many interpretations of the reasons for the astronomical investment are being made.According to the industry on July 20, Samsung Electronics ' plan to invest in semiconductor facilities by the end of the year more than doubled from last year's 13.15 trillion won, resulting in an increase of 124 percent. Thirteen percent of semiconductor facility investment increased the most since 2010, and the same percentage of semiconductor facility investment increased dramatically in 2013 (- 9 percent) and last year (- 10.6 percent), respectively, considering the decreased investment. Compared with the growth rate of investment in display facilities (43 percent), which costs 14.1 trillion won, semiconductor growth is even higher.The total amount of facility investment this year by global semiconductor manufacturers, estimated by global market research firm IC Insight, is $ 90.8 billion (approximately 100 trillion won), which is one third of Samsung's total investment. SK Hynix invested a record 9.6 trillion won this year, but it has more than the combined amount of TSMC, the U.S. powerhouse of integrated memory chip maker Intel and foundry (semiconductor processing).Samsung is also investing in DRAM chips, in addition to the Poundry Micro-Process Line at its Pyongtaek campus. While Samsung Electronics is officially in favor of increasing memory demand, the industry is trying to beat its rivals ` initial push to chase the drop in prices despite short-term price drops due to a supply increase. It is aimed at Japanese Toshiba Memory, which has completed its sales and is seeking a comeback, and Chinese companies that will start mass production in the second half of next year. Ju Dae-young, an honorary researcher at the Korea Institute of Industrial Economics and Trade, said, "" Samsung Electronics has the know-how to win the game with DRAM chips in the 2000s. In the short run, Samsung's preemptive investment will slow down the price of DRAM chips. ""Samsung's large-scale investment is not just about "" chasing and kicking the rival "". The refinement of the semiconductor process has reached its limit, and the amount of investment in the high places per unit has increased. If the finished products were made with 300 processes in the past, the investment is growing as more than 500 of them have to be processed. This means that Korea should continue to make substantial investment in order to stay at No.1.As the total number of U.S. battlefield employees ' mergers and acquisitions (M&As), which appeared to have taken over the U.S. battlefield Haman last year, could prove to be on track. It may be a long-term warning that no major investment is seen in new areas other than the ones that are usually good at, said an industry official.Kim Chang-hoon, reporter of Samsung Electronics ' Pyeongtaek-taek semiconductor plant, Line 1, Supplied to Work For Last July.

Charles Manson, wife of a murder at a hospital in California, died in Seoul on July 19. The California Recorrection Service (CDCRE) confirmed in its e-mail that Manson's death was caused by natural causes due to old age. Manson, who has been serving a life sentence at a state jail in California, has had health problems in recent years. He was also hospitalized with stomach bleeding last January. Leading a group called the Manson family, he killed the wife Sharon Tate, who was eight months pregnant when Polanski was away for a film in 1969. Police later arrested four other members of the group besides Manson and saw that Manson was at the base of the atrocities and arrested him. In 1971, five people were sentenced to death on suspicion of murder, but were sentenced to life in prison in 1972. It was because the state Supreme Court abolished capital punishment. The Manson group killed seven people in two rich areas of Los Angeles. Especially, the two murders committed in August 1969 were made as if they were ethnic wars committed by black gunmen. He also told his followers that the incident would provoke a white man's emotion, sparking widespread violence against blacks. At that time, American society was at its peak of a nationwide uprising following the assassination of Reverend Martin Luther King, 1968-1906. Manson is a huge fan of the Beatles and was called the Helter Skelter family. Helter Skelter is from the Beatles ' 1968 album, "" The Beatles. "" Over the next few years, their massacre was created with books, songs, movies, and operas, titled Helter Skelter.

The then deputy prime minister, Lim Chang-yeol, held an emergency news conference at 10:20 p.m. and announced the announcement. It was the beginning of the IMF bailout system, in which economic sovereignty was taken away for the next three years and eight months. Lee Deok-hun, a journalist at the IMF bailout fund, has shaken the Korean economy to its foundations, including the removal of 16 of the nation's top 30 conglomerates and the removal of 16 of its 26 banks, but it has fulfilled various reform tasks that had been delayed. Michelle Kangdrey, then head of the IMF, sometimes called it a "" blessing in disguise. "" Twenty years later, is the Korean economy in a safe place from crisis?In an interview with the journal on July 18, Lim diagnosed the foreign exchange crisis as a temporary and acute disease, but now the Korean economy is dying of cancer. "" Chosun (one of its major industries) is already losing control of itself, and there are few electrons left, "" he said, adding, "" If we fail to come up with a solution to prolong the life of our major industries, Korea's economy will be seriously affected. ""The Korean government earlier paid off $ 19.5 billion in loans from the IMF in three years and eight months. It does not seem to be a good idea to start early. There is a side that the public has quickly forgotten about pain and lessons.

Experts say the weak areas that could lead to an economic crisis are the collapse of the key industries (20.6 %) and the ' household debt ' (17.5 %) and the ' low labor productivity and labor-management relations ' (16.5 %).The Korean people joined the gold collecting movement to overcome the national disaster when the number of jobless reached 1.7 million 20 years ago. However, the poll found that the sense of community weakened a lot : `` If a crisis broke out again, it would make the public join in sharing pain (37.8 percent) rather than in collecting gold.

The 00 Regional Public Service Bureau of Public Affairs and Public Enterprise Research analyzed the suspicion of dodging the high transfer profit margins of unlisted A companies and selected it for investigation. Although no problems were found in the process of selecting investigations on paper, according to reports made by the media, there were circumstances in which it was suspected of abusing the authority of tax inspection other than tax purposes. In a report to the media at the time, it stated that they conducted a tax investigation on Kim Je-dong's agency to pressure the organizers of the candlelight vigils. As a result of the TF inspection, the company B had no previous tax investigation history, but the company A had its tax investigation history verified, making the authenticity of the remarks unclear.

E, the local factory operator abroad, is relatively small in size with less than 50 billion won in total appearance and is run by the family of former chairman Park Yeon-cha, who is suspected of being targeted at family members. The district office requested the National Tax Service to cross-check Park as a leading local figure and as such, to determine whether he needs to cross-check on Taekwang unemployment.

Democratic Party Rep. Kim Byung-ki, secretary of the ruling National Assembly's Intelligence Committee, will represent a revision to the NIS law this week. The order of the president and intelligence chiefs must be in writing, among other new independent Parliamentary Commissioner for information and to see what you're recording a history. Kim has a National Intelligence Service personnel of the Moon Jae-in government right after the inauguration of the head of state, in planning and advisory committees or commissions have since Cheong Wa Dae and the foreign and security subcommittee about the big picture intelligence agency reform.Has been sympathetic to. We can see that it is not only the legal basis to support the reform measures announced by the NIS reform committee on July 13, but also to reflect the reform plans the government has set out to make, a key ruling party official said. The JoongAng Ilbo obtained a revision to the NIS law on July 19, which was proposed by the National Intelligence Service (NIS → Overseas Security Intelligence Service), the abolition of the criminal investigation rights, and the National Intelligence Service's reform committee, which strengthened its punishment for deferring employees. Among the proposed revisions to the National Intelligence Service Act, the new measure calls for hiring three intelligence inspectors from outside the NIS to independently inspect the NIS. The revision calls for having one vice minister-level intelligence inspector and two first-level inspectors, with a three-year term. Ways, the president appointed him to recommend candidates to NIS chief. The president and director of operations when instructions or perform a specific security requirements to recording a history in writing. Exceptions apply if urgency is required, but they must be written and stored within 48 hours. It is intended to stop the NIS from becoming a private institution for the most powerful. The ban on NIS officials from engaging in politics has also expanded the tax burden and strengthened penalties. First, the clause banning illegal wiretapping was newly established, preventing the recording and listening of conversations among others, or bugging not prescribed in the Act. In addition, it is prohibited from expressing political opinions or inducing government officials to hold rallies for certain parties or ideologies to prevent the recurrence of the NIS political comment case. The penalties for the government official's abuse of power and control were raised to those for the past seven years or less and to those for the past three years or more from the suspension of seven years. Another key element of the revision is the tightened "" micro-control "" of the NIS money flow. Many point out that the NIS budget is covered in mystery and is used as a ' money for rent ' to the Strategy and Finance Minister during the compilation stage. If the revision is approved, however, special expenses should be reported to the National Assembly on a case-by-case basis and other items other than special expenses should be disclosed on the National Assembly information. The report also requires the president to submit the report to the National Assembly by June every year. However, it is expected that the National Assembly will have difficulties even though the ruling party is determined to do so. The main opposition Grand National Party is passive in revising the law, citing weakened capabilities of North Korea. In addition, some of the measures devised by the Democratic Party are being criticized for being effective. In particular, president and the chief of those clauses forcing work to document soksseongsang, intelligence problem is whether what may be in life is confidential.There is a strong possibility. It is also controversial to look into the budget of the NIS.

"Education ministry officials announced yesterday that they would like to change their scores of applicants from Gwangju High School, Pohang Girls ' High School, Dae-Dong High School, and Jangseong High School to 10 schools.Lee Jin-seok, policy director at the University of Education's Policy Division, told a joint briefing Friday at Seoul National University, "" If there is such a big earthquake before the test, it is possible that it will be delayed again. ""Lee said, It is not an assumption, but we can rearrange the area near Pohang in the event of another earthquake and see only the areas near Pohang, one of which can not be found. "" We have a manual internally for examination centers in the area, but we will make announcements immediately, including remedies, if such incidents occur, "" he said. If an earthquake occurs, parts of the country may not be able to deal with it, but they will not delay altogether. "" It took at least two months for me to take the exam again, "" Lee said. "" Because the exam committee and the supplementary staff are scheduled to leave the exam on October 16, they will have 731 students who will be on the same day. They are also sharing the pain of having to operate in a closed space for another week as a result, said Park Jae-soo, who headed the research team.Regarding possible repeat tests, an Education Ministry official said, Though we may fail to take them locally, it is difficult to delay them altogether. The government decided to change the exam locations of the four schools in Pohang, where students take exam centers, which are affected by the earthquake. A substitute test center will be set up in Nam-gu, Pohang, to accommodate test takers. As of 2:00 p.m. on July 22, the preliminary meeting date will be set, and the student movement plans and the meeting place will be decided in the zone. Social Minister and Education Minister Kim Sang-gon told a briefing, "" The results of a facility safety diagnosis on Pohang test sites show that there is not a big structural risk in all of the schools, but the damage could have been severe in the test centers. "" So far, the ministry has been reviewing whether to operate 12 places in Pohang (excluding Ulsan High School and Youngdeok High School, which are free from earthquakes). Four schools have decided to relocate their exam sites.The government decided to change only four out of the total number of test takers, which was determined to have no problems using the facilities, in accordance with the opinions of anxious students and parents. Most of the students want to take the test in Pohang, and the possibility of safety accidents due to large-scale relocation was also considered comprehensively, Kim explained.The ministry conducted a survey of high school seniors in Pohang and found that more than 90 percent of them said they wanted to take the test because they wanted to control their fitness levels and ease of transportation if the building is structurally safe.Four schools are scheduled to be readmitted : Port High, Pohang Girls ` High School, Daedong High School and Jangseong High School. These schools decided to establish an alternative test site in Nam-gu, Pohang, not far from the original test site. The alternative schools are four : Pohang Iron & Steel Co., Ochun High School, Pohang Poeun Middle School and Pohang University.The ministry also said it will prepare 12 preliminary test centers in the vicinity of Pohang, Yeongcheon and Gyeongsan, and prepare emergency transportation measures for students and their supervisor.The Pohang pre-communication will be held at 2:00 p.m. on July 22. Based on this time, the plan to transfer students from Pohang will be confirmed on the morning of the day of the examination and the place they are summoned.If the scores of aftershocks were confirmed, students will move individually to the preliminary test site on the day of the CSAT. In this case, the government will provide 100,000 won for each student transportation or move schools.In contrast, if the test center is changed to a temporary testing center outside of the government building after the preliminary meeting, it will first gather at an exam center inside the jurisdiction on the day of the national college entrance examination and move to a bus. The government is planning to arrange emergency vehicles (200-250 buses) to transport examinees, inspectors, and questionnaires to 12 exam centers simultaneously.If aftershocks occur after the test day (8:10 a.m.), the government will respond according to the measures to deal with an earthquake on the exam, but the judgment of the sites should be made first.The government announced that the head of the Emergency Response Service for the College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) in Pohang will immediately respond to emergency situations with the Gyeongbuk Office of Education and the Korea Institute of Evaluation on the same day.Basically, you feel vibrations, but in the event of a minor situation, you should continue to perform the test without interruption. In principle, if vibration is felt and safety is not threatened, the test should be resumed after the suspension of the test if it is safe to do so. In principle, if the vibration is of a significantly practical nature, it is necessary to stop the test and evacuate the classroom (playgrounds). The government also announced measures to support the pan-governmental body for stable CSAT. On the test day, two fire department officials and two rescue workers will be assigned to the Pohang area, and two fire department workers will be assigned to other regions. The government will also provide car support for remote travel situations, face-to-face consultations to stabilize the sentiment of test-takers, and wired consultations.In addition, if soldiers (soldiers, medical police, or social service personnel) take the test, the original purpose of the test is to convert the song to an official price and to delay the date of joining the army.The government also provided convenience for test takers who move to libraries or other areas by boat, and also exempted their accommodation and airline cancellation fees due to a refund of the entrance examination fee by the non-responders, and a postponement of the admission process. Kim said, We will maintain an emergency management system until the exam is over so that students in Pohang can take the delayed CSAT without interruption, especially when they are safe to take the exam. kangse@newsis.com>"

The reason seems to have been the fact that I had to work late the last few days and make do with fast food for dinner. After washing, I stood in front of the smart mirror and dressed up for the weather today.Experts predict that the high technology will soon make the scene possible only in movies reality. As various smart devices are increasing and they are integrated into one, the IoT technology is being developed, it is becoming a convenient world. However, after a convenient life, there is an important problem to solve. It is a battery problem to operate the device.The use of energy harvesing techniques is limitless. Piezoelectric devices can be installed on the floor to collect the electrical energy that people generate when they walk, and batteries can also be charged by collecting the heat, sound, and vibration energy generated by copiers, as shown in pictures.Germany Wonderpool Engineering Provide#May this year was the hottest May ever since the Korea Meteorological Administration began its nationwide meteorological survey in 1973. The national average temperature in May was 18.7 degrees Celsius higher than the average year (17.2 degrees), and the record for the highest temperature in May has been revised annually since 2014. The summer on the Korean Peninsula is getting so fast that it is taken for granted that a heat wave will hit the nation by the end of May with temperatures exceeding 30 degrees.As the hot summer and cold winter due to global warming are becoming more frequent, electricity usage is also increasing. In particular, the possible power outage caused by a sudden increase in power demand, the blackout, is becoming a concern. The underlying cause is the climate change caused by global warming and many countries have noted nuclear power as an alternative to changing their fossil fuel-oriented energy systems such as oil and coal. The instability of international oil prices has also made nuclear power a viable option for it to reliably provide energy. However, since the Fukushima nuclear plant accident in Japan in 2011, public concerns over radiation safety have made it difficult to add nuclear plants. As the new government is taking place here, nuclear plants have become a hot issue.The intersection of these two scenes has led scientists to focus their attention on the ' energy harvesting ', or ' energy harvesting ' technology. Energy havesting techniques, like the fire warnings, are ' re-viewing used energy '. Technology not only reduces and saves energy but also gathers wasted energy and turns it into usable energy again.Because of this, energy harvesing has become one of the most notable and most controversial technologies in the world since it was selected in 2015 as one of the ' 10 Most Prospective Technologies ' by the United States's Massachusetts Institute of Technology and one of the most popular American scientific magazines, Popular Technology.The concept of energy-harvesting technology is relatively simple.Fans use electric energy in the summer to turn their wings into kinetic energy, creating cool winds. As the fans turn, they generate noise, vibration, and heat, which is actually discarded other than wind energy. Cars also move when fossil energy, such as gasoline, diesel, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) is converted to kinetic energy, and a considerable amount of energy disappears without being used.A person can convert their chemical energy from food into energy that works, and turn their whole day into electric energy. Once you have collected all of your body temperature, you can get 116-watt structure in your sleep, 19W when you read a book, 200W when you work out lightly, and 100W when you're working out a hard day. This much energy can turn on 18 light bulbs.Energy havesting technologies allow us to collect and recycle the missing energy without being conscious. The concept was originally created as a way to keep the equipment in the remote areas of the country that are difficult to supply with electricity or as small electronic equipment that we use frequently in our daily lives, running without batteries.Energy havesting is distinguished by the method and device used to obtain energy. Typical technologies are ▲ Piezoelectric & Electro-Electro-electronic Induction _ and Photo-electric.The first to be developed with energy-harvesting technology is the photoelectric method. This method of converting light into electric energy came from the first energy burning concept developed by Bell Laboratories in 1954. This method utilizes the photoelectric effect that Albert Einstein first discovered. Using the photoelectric effect of releasing electrons when metals absorb high-energy electromagnetic radiation, solar cell technology is called solar cell technology. Because of this, solar cell technologies are both energy-harvesting technologies and re-energy technologies.The most studied technology is Piezoelectrics. It is a technique that uses the piezo-electric effect discovered by the French scientist Curie and her brother in 1880. When some materials are subjected to mechanical pressure, the genetic polarization is divided into positive and negative charges, which changes the material's surface charge density, resulting in an electro-electric effect. Piezo-electric harvesting technology is an energy-producing method that applies pressure to a device called a piezo-electric element to produce electricity.French multinational company Schneider Electrick introduced a system called Favezen at the Paris Marathon in France in 2013, and it is a typical piezo-electric version of the system. Schnider Elektrick then installed 176 piezo-electric tiles near the finish line of the Paris Marathon, allowing 37,000 participants to store electricity on battery in nearby schools. In addition, piezo-electric parts are installed at the floor of the ticket gates in Tokyo, Japan, and the devices are operated by converting the pressure and vibrations that passengers step on into electric energy.When piezo-electric elements are installed in small electronic devices such as remote control and switches, they can operate TVs, audio, and air conditioners as pressure is switched on. The remote control is possible without a battery.Thermoelectric method is the technique of obtaining electricity from waste heat which is discarded. When heated to one side in a metal-like conductor, it is possible to utilize an electrothermal thermoelectric phenomenon, which creates a difference in temperature between different parts. Electric boards in car engines and various electronic appliances produce useless heat, and the installation of thermal electric devices provides power. Last year, the Nanoparticles Research Center at the Korea Basic Research Institute (IBS) developed thermal electric material that can charge wearable devices by generating electricity with human body temperature. Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology also developed a band-type thermal electric device measuring 10cm in size each to drive the semiconductor chip by using the heat generated from the difference between ambient temperature and body temperature.40 mWr Cell phones can be used because of the size of a jacket and the potential to generate about two watts of power.Energy havesting, using electromagnetic induction laws, where electricity creates magnetic fields and magnetic fields can generate electricity, is another popular technique.Electromagnetic radiation produces electricity by creating microelectronic devices that are installed in mechanical devices that produce periodic motion such as vibrations. An automatic watch that operates the clock with no batteries and a rocking motion in front of it is an electromagnetic device.A variety of energy harbestings are also being investigated, including the radio frequency method using radio waves and the metabolic energy of microscopic algae, such as phytoplankton.The study of energy harvesing techniques is actively being researched in Europe and the United States. IDTech Company, an English market research firm, forecast that the global energy harvesting market will reach $ 5.82 billion (approximately 5.8932 trillion won) in 2022.Experts say "" Energy hardening technology is essential for activating smart cities or IoT. "" "" It is important to recognize small changes in the surrounding environment to increase the efficiency of energy conversion. ""Helpful journalist edmondy@seoul.co.kr"
"▽ Green new environment without greenhouse gas 〓 Germany made 500 rounds of hydrogen production plant earth 500 times a year. If it misses the initiative, it can pose a challenge to the German people in the 10 major hydrogen revolution. Hyundai Motor's German arm has a hydrogen station built by Air Liquid in its front yard. Ten hydrogen cars fill the tank every day. [Kim Do-nyun] In January 2013, Korea became the world's first country to manufacture hydrogen cars (Hyundai Tucson). With the capacity to run for up to 415 kilometers per charge, the industry praised hydrogen cars have finally reached the level of internal combustion engines. Earlier this month, four years later, Toyota Motor unveiled its 3,000-kilometer fine-friendly ride. Korea first developed hydrogen cars but allowed Japan to pass. Korea was reluctant to build its hydrogen plant infrastructure as Japan began supplying hydrogen cars with 79 hydrogen charging stations. There are only 11 hydrogen charging stations in Korea, including six research stations. The 2004 JoongAng Ilbo 52th-Year logo Human Challenge to Break Away from fossil fuels - oil and coal - is unfolding around the world. One of the main sources of energy is hydrogen. Hydrogen is easy to obtain by electrolytic water using solar, wind and geothermal power sources anywhere. The hydrogen fuel cells produce electricity while combining with oxygen, and using the electricity, mechanical devices such as cars and boilers move. Once electricity is produced, only clean water vapor is released as a byproduct. That is why countries around the world are paying keen attention to hydrogen to prepare for a new climate system that could reduce greenhouse gases by up to 65 percent compared to 1990. Germany, which was visited by reporters from the JoongAng Ilbo, has already set up nearly 40 hydrogen charging stations in Berlin and Frankfurt. German Energy Park Mintz, a hydrogen factory, produces 200 tons of hydrogen per year, three times a wind generator, allowing one hydrogen car to run 500 revolutions (20 million kilometers) around the globe. Japan is also preparing a distribution network to import hydrogen from Australia and Africa by using a liquid hydrogen carrier, and in Walmart, California, U.S., a hydrogen forklift truck carries cargo from warehouse. Because hydrogen has the advantage of its extensive use to replace most of the oil and natural gas fields. Of course I have a long way to go. Even Germany, where the government is active in spreading hydrogen energy. Tilman Wilhelm, director of hydrogen fuel cell in Germany, said, We still use hydrogen as a complement to wind and solar energy. Ultimately, it is our goal to create a hydrogen energy network. "" Future scientists, including Jeremy Rifkin, forecast that the advent of a hydrogen economy, in which electricity generated from hydrogen is the main source, could dramatically alter the political landscape here and abroad. Military tension between the petroleum-dominated Middle East and Western nations is also likely to ease. Since hydrogen can be made into electricity at home, it can be exchanged with energy via the Internet as if it were exchanged with information via social networking services. Korea has also secured various options, including a roadmap for the expansion of hydrogen energy in 2015. However, there are many problems as if the company failed to gain control of the company. Korea relies on overseas technologies to produce hydrogen, store and transport more than 40 percent of its technology, said Park Jin-nam, a professor at Kyung-il University, adding, There is too much to make up for the system.

"Investors who were injured by recruiting litigants from July 20 due to the recent server collapse of the Virtual Monetary Exchange will take legal action against them. Up to thousands of victims complained that the virtual currency exchange is delaying its announcement of a counterblow and that its terms of use was too unfair. ○ The first group of victims to hold an offline meeting, Park (38) told The Dong-A Ilbo on July 19, adding, `` The victims are expected to meet offline for the first time. '' The cafe had more than 6,680 subscribers. As a result, thousands of plaintiffs are expected to participate in the lawsuit. The case began on July 12 when the price of Bitcone Cache, a kind of virtual currency, significantly increased. As investors flocked to Bitcone Cache, the price of 1-bit coin was the highest ever at 4:04 p.m. when it was recorded at 2.84 million won. However, the price of the peak began to fall soon, and unfortunately, the rain on the Bitcone Cache trading also stopped due to overheating servers. Trade resumed around 5:40 p.m., an hour and a half later, but the price of the one-bit coin cache had already plummeted to 1.68 million won. Many investors lost up to hundreds of millions of won due to the disruption in servers. Park said, We had previously had problems with the system on a day when the price of virtual currencies surged, but it was repeated. The deal is in small groups, and the exchange is not properly equipped with a system, the official said. Now, Bitsum is working on ways to compensate the victims. "" We are investigating the situation first, "" said Blitsheam. If there is something to be held responsible, I will be responsible. Victims, however, have decided to take legal action, calling it a "" time trap. "" The financial authorities ` decision to look at fires across the river is divided among experts as to whether they can be compensated in lawsuits. Han Noo-ri, chief lawyer of law firm Kim Joo-young, said, If we have records of the selling buttons when we experience access problems, we can prove the cause-and-effect relationship of access problems. On the other hand, some say that it is impossible to blame the server's failure due to the increase in the number of users on the stock exchange. It won`t be easy to win because we don`t intentionally close the server, lawyer Kim Jin-woo said. Even if it is a civil error, it can be difficult to prove the cause and effect of the mistakes. Terms and conditions are another issue. The terms of use shall include an exemption from the use of the Agreement that says, "" The company does not take responsibility for defects in the sale due to a defect in the system. "" With the college, the chances of investors winning could be reduced. Chung Kyung-young, a professor at Sungkyunkwan University, said, There will be disputes over whether the exemption rules are effective under the law. Many point out that this is a pre-announced situation. Currently, the virtual currency exchange is classified as a mail-order business like Internet shopping malls. The exchanges are growing like ' dinosaurs, ' but they are not under the supervision of financial institutions. They are free from regulations to prepare for hacking attacks and server overload. The amount of money traded in one comb chip shop on July 12 alone is more than 6 trillion won. It is equivalent to the average daily transaction amount (8 trillion won) of the Korean stock market (as of this month), which combines securities and KOSDAQ markets. However, the financial authorities say they will not intervene for the time being. We can not regulate virtual currency because it is neither official money nor financial products, said an official at the financial authorities. Kim Seong-mo, reporter of mo@donga.com and Kang Yoo-hyun of the China Daily, official Facebook, exclusively and the Dong-A Ilbo, and the North Korean President Xi Jinping, who visited the North Korea and re-technicated the North Korean government (click!), illegally copied and redistributed the North Korea's China Daily News Agency, ,The news agency visited the Sun Palace in Geumsusan and paid tribute to her and to her Chinese counterpart, Songdo (Songtao), who is the special envoy of her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.Song and his team toured the medal preservation office in Geumsusan Mountain and the passenger car, train, boat and train conservation room used by Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. Song also wrote in a guest book, ' We express ardent longing for Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, great leaders of the Korean people and close friends of the Chinese people! ' Song also visited a memorial tower on the same day to symbolize the friendship between the two countries. The official said that the top envoys to the North had kept a basket of flowers in the tower on July 19, along with members of China`s ambassador to the North, Li Jin-jin and embassy in Seoul. Song also visited Seongheung Revolutional Site in Hoechang County, South Pyeongan Province, in memory of Chinese soldiers who participated in the Korean War, and laid flowers at the People's Assistance Center.North Korean media have not reported whether Song had an interview with Kim Jong Un as chairman of the ruling Workers ` Party until that day. 25 The news, ▶ @ letit watching together!, ▶ 'Pyeongchang 2018' news and photo viewing, Naver ‘1 news channel’ to the mains! to set up [ Korea (news1.kr), 1 © the news war damage and without leave.Redistribution ] on Ryu Mi-yong 北 leader of Cheondogyo, residents in Korea and the first anniversary of the first private Moon Jae-in government is “humanitarian decision” Unification Ministry, Unification Ministry. and at second son, choeingukThe right to visit North Korea, (late) Ryu Mi-yong Chondoist Chongu Party central committee, the first anniversary of North Korea (picture) second son living in Korea in the event choeinguk (71), who is present.A Unification Ministry official said on July 19, "" I recently approved Choi In-kook's visit to Pyongyang, and Choi is scheduled to attend the first anniversary of the death of Chairman Liu. "" Choi is scheduled to visit Pyongyang from July 22-27 to attend the first anniversary of Liu's death and return home. Choi's visit to Pyongyang is the first time this year that an individual granted approval. The Unification Ministry approved the visit to North Korea so that Choi can die as a humanitarian mother even when Chairman Liu died on Nov. 23 last year at the age of 95. When Chairman Ryu passed away, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sent a wreath and funeral service was held as chairman of the Social Affairs Committee with Chairman Yang Hyung-seop of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People`s Assembly. Liu Dong-yeol, the only daughter of Cho Dong-yeol, former head of the Korean interim government and former chief of staff, and Korea's former Foreign Minister and State of West Germany's ambassador, was Chairman Choe Deok-kyung (1914-1914). In 1986, he went to North Korea with his husband to work as an advisor on the Central Map of the Church of the Joseon Dynasty, the head of the Cheondo Church's ruling Workers ' Party, the chairman of the Dangun National Unification Council, and a member of the Supreme People`s Assembly.As the eldest of Chairman Ryu's two sons and three daughters are dead and his three daughters live abroad, Choi, the second son living in Korea, is actually the eldest son.

"② News 1, Pohang Earthquake and CSAT postponement also resulted in an increase of 3 percent from the previous year (Seoul = News 1). Unlike previous years, he received a variety of attractions such as e-Sports, to remove worries of a sluggish performance following the Pohang earthquake. On July 20, the organizing committee of Gistar announced that a total of 230,000 people attended the event during the four-day run from July 16 to 19. The figure is an increase of 3 percent from the previous year. Especially, on the 18th, when the weekend began, a total of 83,000 people visited the museum, marking the highest number of visitors per day. On the last day of the festival, more than 60,000 people attended the concert, marking the highest performance ever. This year, Gistar extended its presence to the middle-graders with the addition of e-sports and other attractions. E-sports, which became a new trend this year following last year`s virtual reality video show "" VR, "" have become a catalyst for its success in the game.Blue Hole and Actoz Soft have used up more than 100 booths to hold an e-sports event that will cost hundreds of millions of won. Visitors could watch the game from anywhere with a big screen measuring 30m. This is a scene not seen in Gistar last year. One female visitor to the Blue Hole booth said, I came down to Busan to see the Battle Ground e-Sports rather than go through a brand-new game, feeling like I was on the ground. Bang Joon-hyuck, chairman of the Netmable Games board, also enjoyed many things to see this year with the addition of e-sports besides PCs and mobile phones, said Jistar, who would watch the event for nearly half an hour this year.As the growth potential of e-sports market is confirmed through the new G-star program, Korean game makers including Actoz Soft plan to speed up the regular e-sports market. Players even started to build exclusive stadiums with a cost of 50 billion won. Next year, the market is expected to be worth about 1 trillion won. On the other hand, the B2B events where businesses meet each other on the other hand are considered too disappointing to see few cases leading up to the actual contract. Only 130 contracts were consulted, and only 2,000 buyers participated. In particular, Chinese game history officials have turned their back on Gistar this year, following the Chinese government's ban on importing Korean games."" In particular, Chinese buyers did not go to Gistar this year because of the ban, "" a Tensent Korea official said. "" It is difficult to service even if I take Korean games, I haven't explained at all. "" It is also regrettable that overseas game companies are absent. Last year, the nation's leading PC online game market, Liatt Games and Blizzard, were also excluded, while other leading Japanese PC and console game makers cut off. However, with the advent of a new generation of e-sports and new PC based on the hit movie Battle Ground this year, the movie is considered to have been more exciting than the attendance at a few game store booths in the past. Most important of all, it is significant that the test was postponed until the opening of the university, when a large number of test-takers did not attend the event.Kakao Games representative Nam Goong-hoon said, "" There were no new products or new equipment that were expected, and despite the postponement of the CSAT, the number of visitors has sharply increased because of the ' fun of seeing.

Korean Air and U.S. Delta Airlines announced on July 19 that they received final approval from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to implement a joint venture into the Pacific route. Joint venture is defined as one in which two or more airlines jointly operate specific routes and share profits and costs as if they were a company. It is a high-end collaborative system that is higher than Codeshare, which shares several seats, check in counters and mileage. We can reduce costs through the efficiency of our routes, joint sale of air tickets, increased marketing, joint connection of baggage, and joint cooperation of air cargo, a Korean Air official explained. gaga@joongang.co.kr] Delta Airlines, reporter of Lee Jung-kwon, will close its air route to Narita, Japan on January 8 next year when Incheon International Airport's second passenger terminal is opened. Delta Airlines has operated the Narita - Guam route once or twice a day to transport U.S. soldiers and supplies to and from the United States and Japan. It will eliminate it from January next year and encourage its customers to use Korean Air`s Incheon- Guam route. There is also a reason why North Korea's threats of missile strikes against Guam reduced the number of Japanese tourists, while increasing number of South Korean tourists. In addition, direct flights to Atlanta, Portland, and Minneapolis to Japan are likely to disappear and have to go via Incheon unconditionally. Delta Airlines is the only direct flights to Japan in these cities, and that is because delta Airlines is the only one that operates the flights there. `` Incheon Airport can lead to 80 Asian cities, boosting the competitiveness of Asia-Pacific routes, '' said chief executive Ed Bastian of Delta Airlines at a news conference in Atlanta last month. At that time, he invited four times more Korean media than Japan to the news conference. Delta Airlines flew 180 flights a week in 2011 to Narita Airport, but now operates 76, less than half of them. Incheon International Airport's second passenger terminal is dedicated to the Sky Team, so it is also advantageous for transferring to Delta Airlines. Japan`s JAL and ANA are two of Japan's leading airlines, Wonwald and Star Alliance. United States Air Lines, the third largest carrier in the world, is also working on the Korean skies. United Airlines ended all of its Asian routes via Narita on July 28. Instead, it will fly directly to major cities such as Incheon, Beijing, Shanghai, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Manila, Singapore and Taipei. Yunitid Airlines operates as a two-line city, including Chengdu and Xian, as the U.S.-China exchange is brisk. United States Airline has 90 flights to China, more than 70 flights per week. Such Japanese packaging by U.S. airlines threatens many of the Japanese airports that represent Asia Herb Airport. `` Japan's status in the strategic choices of U.S. airlines has been declining, '' Nihon Keizai Shimbun said. `` This has delayed the construction of a third runway with Narita's future. '' The paper added, By comparison, Incheon Airport is steadily improving its infrastructure, including construction of the second terminal and providing convenience for Codeshare. The number of foreign tourists to Japan exceeded 20 million from January to September this year. However, the number of passengers who return to Narita Airport decreased 19 percent year-on-year to 3.87 million during the same period. Decline five years in a row Haneda Airport reopened as International Airport in 2010, but only seven percent of Narita Airport's passengers are still international. Incheon Airport has about 56.5 million people who pass by the first nine months of this year. As the center of human exchange and logistics, Incheon Airport is one step ahead of Japan Airport. To attract tourists and boost domestic demand, the Japanese government has been conducting a destination strategy, not for foreign-based airlines, an official at the airport said, explaining why Incheon Airport is a hub airport. Incheon Airport, however, can not afford to remain complacent in its competition for the Asian Herb Airport. This is because China's new Beijing International Airport is completed next year. Annual traffic is forecast to reach 70 million, nearly double Incheon Airport. Beijing New International Airport is planning to transform China into a hub airport connecting North America, Europe and Asia. Kim Yoo-kyung journalist ne @ joongang.co.crk."

People who took the lead in his ouster announced in a TV speech that they were disappointed and angry enough to organize a protest to demand his resignation, and after 40 years of disappointment and anger, they have already cleared the 93 to power. Mugabe, speaking in a speech to the nation on that day, said he shared `` widespread concern '' with the people of Zimbabwe about the government's turmoil and economy, but did not comment on what the people had hoped to do. Mugabe, who ruled as a dreadful dictator for a long time, is now in reality powerless and unmarried, but shows a strange obsession with Zimbabwe's politics, refusing to let go of its present position. The ruling party already dismissed him from its leadership on July 19, and a massive public rally was held in Harare, the capital of Korea, on July 18, in which massive numbers of high-ranking members continued to protest against him every day. But Mugabe shook hands with military commanders, including his own security forces, began a national TV speech and tried not to lose dignity. One of the generals bent over and told him where to page or read during his speech.

However, Mugabe noted that the military is concerned about the nation`s worsening economy, division within the ruling camp and political strife. Mugabe said there are pros and cons, but the military of the country concerned about the crisis, and I pointed out, as president of Zimbabwe and the commander in the military, too.In fact, became interested in. I think all this was raised with deep patriotism and an honest mind for the stability of the nation and the welfare of our people. Members of the ruling party who decided to sack Mugabe who have held the leadership since the 1980s praised and congratulated him on his dismissal, but Mugabe is determined to hold a general meeting of party leaders and their wives who believe in a minority of supporters and promise to step down. Still, the party has already disciplined Grace for "" making a speech that creates hatred and division and exercising her authority and role that she has not been formally granted. "" Military officials who had hoped for a more formal form of voluntary resignation instead of forced resignations on this day, are also puzzled, and leaders of the military will demand that the worst protest take place should take place, and even Mugabe's leaders will be forced to step down. cmr@newsis.com>"

"Following ' 3.5 ' today and ' 3.6 ' today, the magnitude of the CSAT was decreased due to the increasing number of aftershocks and the growing number of earthquakes in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, and the nation was shocked by. Experts say that since the original earthquake sometimes occurred before the test, tension should not be slowed down again on the 23rd.According to the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) on July 20, after the 5.4 earthquakes on May 15, there were 58 aftershocks from the Pohang earthquake that was recorded on the same day (as at 10:00 a.m). Around 6:05 a.m., an aftershock of 3.6 magnitude occurred in an area 11 kilometers north of Pohang. Six hours earlier, on July 19 at 11:45 p.m., an aftershock measuring 3.5 to 9 kilometers north of Pohang was felt. It is the first time that more than 3.0 aftershocks have occurred in succession since the 5.4 earthquake. The magnitude of the two aftershocks was rated "" Class V "" in North Gyeongsang. Grade IV shows that almost everyone feels earthquake, and anyone sleeping can wake up.Among the 58 remaining earthquakes so far, the magnitude 4.0 to 5.0 or less is one, 5 times less than 3.0 to 4.0, and 52 times less than 2.0 to 3.0.The magnitude of aftershocks is even bigger. The number of aftershocks set to 2.0 or more decreased from 33 on the 15th to 16 on the 16th and to three on the 17th. On the fourth day of the incident, not a single incident occurred. After recording five times (including 3.5 on August 19), an aftershock of 3.6 took place on July 20.Experts warned that although the frequency of aftershocks has decreased, a stronger earthquake may occur again. An earthquake on Gyeongju would also have magnitude 4.5 a week after the quake hit, an official at the Korea Meteorological Administration said, We should not relax our tension on the day of the national college entrance exam, which is a week late. Pohang earthquakes are more likely to have aftershocks of more than three months, said Hong Tae-kyung, a professor of Earth systems science at Yonsei University, stressing the need for stress (earthquake induced energy) in Pohang. Lee Hae-wan, reporter of the website parasa@munhwa.com[ Police sent to the villagers to identify the deceased. She was 83, living in a town in Gapyeong-gun, 20 kilometers from the river. Police asked the National Institute of Scientific Investigation to carry out an autopsy to determine the cause of his death. No major trauma was found in his body and death was declared drowning. A photo of the data from the Gapyong-Bukhangang River [Central Photo] was questioned by police to bring the body to the scene when he died in an accident. And I contacted A's daughter B (43) on July 15. `` Dad is right, '' B said. `` Father and mother went out holding hands together. '' However, something strange was discovered. A few days after his parents went away and lost contact with him, he did not even report his disappearance. I was not surprised at the news of my father's death. Police formed an investigation team to find C (77), the wife of an unidentified man and mother of a B. And examined Mr B in secret. Then a surprising fact was discovered. Police checked CCTV installed around A's house and found that the couple, who had been "" holding hands together, "" will have seen their homes covered at 7:20 p.m. and 9:40 p.m. on July 11. The CCTV showed the couple being carried on a bongo car with their daughter and others on it. After confirming the lie, police tracked the figure in the bongo car. Mr. D (63, female) was in the car with Mr. B. Police officer Line. A daughter who took her parents ashore and a woman in her 60s were immediately arrested by police. The woman in her 60s was known to lead a religious group. Police in Gapyeong, Gyeonggi Province, requested an arrest warrant for each of them Thursday on charges of dumping B for maintaining his employment. They are accused of attempting to bring father A and mother C of blood to Bukhangang Bridge on July 11. "" My father said to the police, ' Get me out of a beautiful, air, and quiet place, ' and my mother said, ' Get me out of the same place as my father, ' so I gave him a lift. "" They usually said they wanted to go to heaven, and then asked Mr. B to help them and put them in cars. According to police, he lived in the U.S. for 30 years and came to Korea about three years ago. He has lived in a house in Gapyeong-gun since October 2016. B, who is single, was an English teacher here but quit a month ago, saying, It is hard to work at an institute. B is believed to be a member of a religious group led by D, police said. Mr. D is said to have served as a pastor of a former Christian sect. "" It is not a teaching or a church building, but a religion where like-minded people gather to chat and pray over tea, "" police officials explained. The congregation also referred to the teacher, not the leader, police said. The size of the house is 214.5 ㎡ (65 pyeong), a four-roomed house for police Mark. Other than the couple of "" A "" and their daughter, "" B "" were also living in the same family. Police believe the two are also members of religious groups led by D. But they do not say anything about the police investigation. It is known that D often visited A's house to see B and them. Police are currently searching the riverside area of North Korea to find the mother of the missing man, B. However, the couple has no cellular phone, so the investigation is in trouble. "" Mr. B and Mr. D have since refused to comment. They're still holding no silence, and it's been confirmed that Mr. C and the others are having a hard time investigating, "" a police officer said. Meanwhile, the investigation into the arrest warrants for B and D was conducted at the Uijeongbu District Court on the morning of that day. Whether to issue an arrest warrant will be decided this afternoon."
