As a result, the consumer price increase was higher than that of other households, so the food price index of gimbap, soju, instant noodles, and jjambbong continued to soar (Yonhap News Agency).Particularly like kimbap, noodles, ramen and jjamppong kimbap and instant noodle [Ahn Cheol-soo shooting] price rose to feel up a lot of people enjoy eating out menu was bigger. The phenomenon is expected to continue this year as the minimum wage hikes have led to the rise in food prices starting this year. According to the National Statistical Office, the price of meals last year rose 2.4 percent from a year ago. It is 0.5 % higher than the overall consumer price increase rate of 1.9 %. It has been five years since the price of restaurants was higher than that of consumers. Food prices rose 1.5 percent in 2013, 1.4 percent in 2014, and remained at around 2 percent in 2015 and 2016. However, consumer prices remained in the 1-percent range, with 1.3 percent in 2013, 1.3 percent in 2014, 0.7 percent in 2015 and 1.0 percent in 2016. If you take a closer look at the products that were on the market, the growth rate of items mostly sought by the working class was particularly high. The number of gimbap with easy access to one meal rose by 7.8 percent last year alone. It is four times higher than consumer prices. Soju, the drink of ordinary people, also increased by 5.2 percent, making it lighter. Beer prices also rose 2.5 percent and the cost of the popular poktanju called wheat.The price of wheat poktang (4.5 percent), instant noodles (4.2 percent), jjambbong (4.0 percent), fried rice (3.6 percent), seolleongtang (3.3 percent), and jjajangmyeon (3.2 percent) were also up from the previous month's restaurants. Among the 39 items analyzed by the National Statistical Office, steak (1.9 percent), pork cutlet (1.8 percent), bibimbap (1.7 percent), and sushi (1.4 percent) were the only items that had a lower increase than the consumer price. The price of gimbap and other large rises are seen as a result of higher raw material costs, including a sharp rise in egg prices last year, said an official at the National Statistical Office, who explained soju's price jumped 3,000 won per bottle from early last year. The food price hike is feared to continue this year. According to the report, the wage burden stemming from a 16.4 percent rise in minimum wage to 730 won is likely to be reflected in the price of meals. The rice cake restaurant raised the price of its main products, including mushrooms, vegetable porridge, and boulnak, by 1,000 won starting July 1. Other menu items are also expected to be raised in the near future. Last month, KFC raised prices of 24 items, including chicken and hamburgers, by an average of 5.9 percent. Nolbu Budae Jjigae and Shinsan Seolnongtang also raised prices by 5.3 to 14 percent.[Table] Rate of price increase for groceries in 2017 ※ Data from National Statistical Office 2vs2@yna.co.kr ▶ Report and enquiry ▶ Conversation with a reporter on a 1:1 chat. A girl who should have been in elementary school five years ago disappeared on suspicion of fraud. The photo shows the wanted photo of a girl's parents. (provided by the Chungbuk Provincial Police Agency) It has not been confirmed whether the APB disappeared with the wanted parents.The Chungbuk Provincial Police Agency announced yesterday that it has been investigating the whereabouts of Kim Yang (11), who was not identified during the previous investigation into preschool children in 2016.According to police, Kim was supposed to attend an elementary school in Cheongju in March 2014 as planned. But so far, no trace of him or whereabouts has been found.However, police are investigating only the fact that her parents were put on the wanted list on March 29, 2014 on suspicion of violating the law on aggravated economic crimes.Her parents posted a message on an Internet used item site from March 2012 to April 2012, asking 43 people to buy gift certificates at a cheap price and paid 2.8 billion won to buy them. The police started an investigation into the victim, but her husband and wife had disappeared, and Kim's whereabouts have not been confirmed since then.Police, investigating missing children at the request of the North Chungcheong Province education office, followed the whereabouts and behavior of the couple by confirming that Kim was their daughter and that they were involved in a scam.She and her husband checked medical records and bank accounts and Internet access records. However, they did not make any profit.We registered for Miss Kim on the Missing Children profiling System and conducted a search of the family and relatives of couples in Cheongju, but found no sign of their behavior.The court also investigated the case of a non-professional-action speaker who took place around the country after it was determined that the couple wanted to make an extreme choice.However, neither the couple nor the couple were identified, and the disappearance of Kim has been unsolved for two years.We have done almost anything to help us identify her, said a police official, I believe Kim is with her parents but we are investigating various possibilities.Sedam_0815 ▶ View the news and photo on PyeongChang 2018.

"▽ Money-Traday Kim Gyeong-hwan : [Minimum wage is expected to be increased by an additional 2.6 percent in the first to second grades.] Government employees will receive a 2.6 percent raise in salary and citizens ' experience. Military salaries also rose 87.8 percent year-on-year to 407,700 won, a substantial increase from 216,000 won last year. Officials and military officials who were criticized for not meeting the minimum wage decided to raise their salaries further. In addition, the government has revised the criteria for approval of the salary experience by civic groups to be broadly recognized in public offices, sparking controversy.The Personnel Reform Bureau (Director of Public Affairs and Communications Affairs Kim Pan-seok) announced yesterday its revision to the Public Officials Repairs Act, which includes a revision to the National Assembly allowance for the improvement of civil servants ' handling in 2018 and the adjustment of civil service benefits for national interface and field office workers. The revision will take effect during January after a Cabinet meeting.First, the company raised wages by 2.6 % (based on the basis of basic salary and allowances, etc.) and raised government employees by more than 2 % (according to the assessment criteria). As for soldiers, they will receive a substantial improvement in the treatment they receive, raising the salary of soldiers by 87.8 % from the previous year.The pay shall be additionally raised for the first and second tier payroll positions (Grade 9) whose pay level is less than the minimum wage despite improvement of 2.6 %. The company will additionally raise the monthly salary of 11,700 won for grade 9 and 82,700 won for grade 1. As a result, the final monthly wage for the first step of the ninth grade will be 1,448,800 won, plus 125,800 won, and the minimum wage level of 1,758,800 won for the position supplement. However, the pay step shall be adjusted to prevent a series of pay increases up to the minimum wage level of the Hobong University.The government will consider various measures to ensure that the wage levels of civil servants do not fall short of the minimum wage level, in preparation for a wage increase of up to 10,000 won. We are considering the consolidation of common benefits and adjustment of working salaries, and we are taking steps to consider the future minimum wage rate and the minimum wage range of wage hikes into consideration, said an official at the Civil Service Agency.Maritime and western sea governments, which illegally fishing foreign fishing boats, also pays 70000 won per month for the risks and uniqueness of duties to the special police officers of the special police unit. Seobeomdan was established in April as illegal fishing by foreign language companies made it harder for the working class to deal with other people. Thanks to the efforts of Seo, crab fishing in the West Sea has normalized recently.The Environment Ministry pays 50,000 won a month in overtime work for employees who are permanently or directly exposed to hazardous chemicals when they enter chemical accidents or accidents. Road workers who are involved in road repair and overload control at road sites will also receive a 50,000 won monthly work allowance.To reflect changes in the knowledge property field, such as rapid technological change such as the fourth industrial revolution and rapid increase in patent examination applications and disputes ~ to reflect changes in the work environment of the knowledge property field, such as the monthly payments of patents, and short-term payments for judgment, and to strengthen expertise by KRW 30,000.Schools and education agencies will provide special monthly bonuses of 20,000 won for counseling or counseling services for victims of school violence, students affected by school violence, and students who fail to fit into school.The pay for civil servants who make the switch to time choices instead of parental leave will be raised to the same level as for the private sector. The government will increase the rate of work allowance for childcare to 80 % of the monthly wage of the month from 500,000 won to 1.5 million won from the lower limit to ease the economic burden of childcare.The additional period of restriction on salary step promotion was extended from three months to six months for government employees who were punished for accepting bribes, entertainment or sexual favors. In addition, in order to simplify the government's civil servant repair system, the household support and transportation subsidy expenses that soldiers receive will be consolidated into the basic salary.At the same time, we will continue to enhance the quality of the quality of the public service we can experience through the efforts of on-site public officials at national interface sites and those who work for dangerous jobs, and we will continue to fulfill our role as a model of the government. * turning around : 2017 * 10 keywords * And free comic book reporting &amp; gifts ^ Cheerleader vs. Racing Girl Kim Kyung-hwan ¡ ° Real Time News with No Contraporation & No Copyist According to data released by the Commission in October last year, the number of delivery apps by the Fair Trade Commission increased sharply from 870,000 in 2013 to 10.46 million in 2015.

"(Mokpo) Yonhap news agency reporter Jang Areum : Other Chinese fishing boats ran away after receiving bullet shots from Coast Guard patrol boats trying to rob Chinese fishing boats captured by the Coast Guard by illegally fishing. An illegal Chinese fishing boat collided with a fishing boat captured by the Korea Coast Guard. The Chinese fishing boats blocked the security guards ' lineups with iron bars and wire bars, and refused to comply with the inspections. Other Chinese fishing boats also threatened to collide with Chinese fishing boats carrying Coast Guard personnel to rob Chinese fishing boats captured by the Coast Guard during the evacuation.Maritime police responded by mobilizing five patrol vessels, three thousand and 1,500 tons, a fisheries guidance ship from the West Coast Fisheries Department, and a helicopter. Chinese fishing boats tried to collide with a 1,500-ton patrol boat, and the Coast Guard fired 453 public-flame M-60 machine guns and personal K2. Chinese fishing boats, which were approaching the 3,000-ton patrol boat, also fired K2. Maritime police have captured two Chinese fishing boats for illegally fishing operations and took 20 sailors aboard to Mokpo. One of them was reportedly damaged by the collision with another Chinese ship. We will continue to crack down on illegal fishing operations in our waters, said a West Coast Guard official. ▶ areum@yna.co.kr article 1:1 ▶ In the latest trends and report and your reporter [graphics] ""Park Geun-hye, for 36 million bribery"" (comprehensive) prosecutors, a supplementary indictment. … gukjjeong nongdan.18 to 20 the case of energy healing and incentive fees, and other operating costs and loss of all the aides 'personal use' Park Geun-hye, former president to appear before a how to use [, Yonhap News Agency.File photo ] (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) chadaeun banghyeondeok reporters are 'gukjjeong nongdan' on trial, accused of taking bribes and large companies related to events that Park Geun-hye, former president.30 billion won from the National Intelligence Service allegedly taking bribes as well as additional four days were prosecuted.

"Intel's computer processor (CPU) is known to have security related design issues. Information contained in kernel memory in the processor could leak into the application. We have heard about it through the Internet community Reddit, and the site of the overseas IT media reported that it was a problem with processor hardware design.The problem has not yet been explained in detail. It is not disclosed what part of the problem is. However, it is known that the firmware can not fix it because it is a chip-design design bug. Because it is a sensitive security problem, it does not seem to explain in detail how the problem penetrates into any channel until it is resolved. Details will be revealed later this month. It would seem to be fair to say that the solution to the problem is distributed by this time.Kernel memory is the system memory space that places the underlying framework for the smooth running of the operating system. The kernel memory contains the most sensitive parts, including all passwords, access keys, and the files cached on the disk. This makes kernel memory completely isolated. Although virtual delimiters of memory are some kind of barrier, they can not be touched by kernel memory if an application suffers from problems while running around or security issues. However, processors at the bottom of the kernel have higher privileges than kernel memory.However, if some functionality in the kernel is needed by Intel, the application calls up the kernel memory, and the processor instantaneously places the system into kernel mode, and then returns the command back to safe mode. Although the details are not yet disclosed, the bug appears to be related to this kernel memory. The processor part that manages the virtual memory address is bungled, and when the bug does not properly encrypt kernel memory, it creates a gap for hackers to access it with system administrator privileges. In severe cases, it is also said that a few lines of JavaScript code embedded on a web page provide a glimpse into kernel memory.AMD reported that it did not have the problem. AMD's statement provides a little more detail on the issue, but AMD's claim to be secure lies in its "" not having the privilege to go beyond the kernel page memory isolation feature. "" It is secure because it accesses kernel memory conservatively. This is a little bit of a paradox : Prefetch and others recently introduced as predetches have played a major role in boosting the performance of Intel processors. It is a function to identify which data the system will process in the future and to make sure that the processor does not rest before it has a lead. This means that the processor is able to access it with greater authority. The solution is to isolate kernel memory. It is a problem that needs to touch the bottom of the operating system. Operating system is known to provide secure handling that prevents access beyond the right between processor and kernel memory. In fact, modifications are being made at the kernel level of the operating system to fix this bug.Already, Linux has begun to distribute kernels that have solved this problem, and it is working on Windows 10. Microsoft has already deployed Windows 10 with this kernel in its Insider Preview since last November to test its reliability. Formal distribution will begin soon with detailed bug reports. The problem is known to be most of the processors that have appeared over the past decade. In fact, most of the devices we use, such as PCs and servers, are potentially at risk.Once the problem appears to be resolved with the operating system kernel patch. The group noted that with the new kernels deployed today, performance is down by 5-10 %. However, PC users need not worry too much. It is not the personal computer but the enterprise data centers that are primarily affected by the operating system's new kernel. It is known that the main role of the PC, including the game, is to influence its performance in the database, data structuring server, and other databases that encrypt and sensitive data. In particular, the performance associated with file systems is known to be highly affected. It is where the new kernel of the operating system adds security to the process of writing and reading something into this memory. Modern processors with the PCID (process context identifier) function are said to be less performance-impacted. Insider Preview in Windows 10 also fixes bugs through the PCID.The data center providing the cloud is no longer on fire. Because security is more important than anything else. Amazon and Azer are said to have hurried to solve the problem. They plan to announce a fix for the problem in the next few days. However, the amount of performance degradation you have to bear is quite a burden. Not all of it has been made public yet. Details of the bug related stories need to be solved and formally commented on by Intel, operating system developers and cloud companies.IT columnist Choi Ho-seop has won the Science and Technology Ministry's Award for Innovation and Alcohol Awareness Contest for Students at the University of Science and Technology and Technology, and the Korea Aerospace Research Institute's Implication Award for Motor Vehicles work.hs.choi@gmail.com] The Ministry of Science and Technology and Information announced yesterday that KAIST took the lead of Jung Ji-won as the team leader in a contest to present 10 nanotechnology technologies owned by government-affiliated researchers.

News 1, 208.1.4 / News 1, was changed to a four-person company for cleaning Hongik University, which led to criticism that it reduced the number of temporary jobs for retirements and senior citizens, and that it should be cleaned by workers at Hongik University. While irregular hourly wages were raised by 83 won at several universities in Seoul last year, university towns pointed out that the replacement of part-time or short-staffed workers has threatened their rights.The KCTU public transportation union, Seokyeong, held a rally on the first floor of Hongik University's Culture and Transportation Workers ` Union yesterday morning and promised not to reduce the number of employees and pay them back.According to Seokyeong chapter, a newly contracted service provider at Hongik University announced that it would not be able to take over four of its existing cleaning workers from July 1. The Seokyeong Branch expects to utilize "" working students or part-time jobs (instead of vacancies). "" We are considering cleaning methods, said an official at Hongik University. Park Jin-kook, chairman of Hongik University, said, We have reported regular jobs for various companies starting with the public sector, but the Hongik University business sites have backtracked against it, adding, We don`t open our voices more loudly.Hongik University is just trying to add to its warehouse by reducing the number of cleaning workers who work for students, said Kim Min-cheol, director of Seokyeong branch, victims of the school.About 100 cleaning and security workers at the rally chanted, "" I've worked for Hongik University.Workers at Yonsei University, the labor union of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, hold a news conference in front of Yonsei University's Student Union building in Seoul Thursday condemning the recruitment of part-time workers. News 1, 2008 The University of News 1, has been showing a growing tendency to reduce the number of non-regular workers who have been cleaned or paid for by part-time workers or to replace them with part-time workers.According to Yonsei University, 31 cleaning and security workers at the university have retired as of July 31. No new hindrances were available, and unmanned security systems were extended or extra morning and afternoon part-time cleaning workers were employed.Yonsei University plans to close some of its guard posts, expand its unmanned automatic guard post, and change its service system from three shifts to two. Considering the financial difficulties, we plan to operate in a different way, said an official at Yonsei University.Workers at Yonsei University's branch in Seokyeong held a news conference in front of Yonsei's Student Center on July 3 to protest Yonsei University, which increases the work of its former employees and creates bad jobs. Korea University also plans to hire part-time workers to fill the vacancies created by 10 U.S. workers who retire. We plan to reduce the overall cleaning time, an official at the university explained, explaining that it is part of streamlining operations.Non-Static workers at more than 10 business sites at major universities such as Hongik University, Yonsei University, Korea University, Ewha Womans University and Sogang University agreed last year to raise their tuition by 83 won per hour.

"Girl's System : An estimated 6.5 million views a day of YouTube's Logan Paul's suicide video. 45 % of all U.S.Star Systems ' charges for advertising, which are alleged to be part of YouTube's recycling controversy, are spent by Galmoori Tuber. U.S. YouTube star Logan Paul (22), who makes about 14 billion won a year, photographed and posted the body of an alleged suicide man on a trip to Japan, creating a stir against YouTube's largest video platform in the world. First, let me explain briefly the situation up to 4 days. YouTube star Logan Paul found the body of the dead man in Japan while visiting Aokihagara near Mount Fuji, called ' suicide forest. ' He posted a blurry video of the body to YouTube on July 31. `` This is not a bait to lead to clicks, '' he said at the opening of the video. `` This will remain a moment in YouTube's history. "" Because I'm sure it never happened on YouTube. "" A warning message was issued and said, "" To raise awareness of suicide, "" but no one believed him at all. Criticism was aroused, including, "" An insult to the bereaved family "" and, "" a dangerous video without consideration of the psychological weakness of teen viewers. "" Paul deleted the video and apologized in about a day. (Video) Video : The incident is set to go down as "" a glimpse into YouTube's history, "" as he said. That's because Paul's image question is shifting to the world's largest video platform, YouTube. Until Paul deleted the video, about 6.5 million people had already watched it in one day, as criticism is growing over why YouTube had not filtered it. In fact, the video was flooded with comments and even became a trend on Twitter, but YouTube had no response. IT media Wired said, "" It is not enough to blame YouTube stars, "" adding, "" We need to put YouTube's platform on trial. "" If you think YouTube is involved in this, you'll see that it's the same kind of revenue model that Logan Paul created on YouTube. This means that since YouTube Star's earnings are directly linked to YouTube's profits, it can not be considered separately. As Wired explains, YouTube has cut down 45 percent of what each account earns for ads. Social Blade, which analyzes the profits of YouTube's money, shows that Paul's biggest estimated earnings are nearly $ 14 billion per year, as well. That is why it is not possible for YouTube to not manage the ' assets ' that earn 10 billion a year. Wired said the previously contacted YouTube residents worked with YouTube's staff. The same is true of Korea. Game B.J. the Library, which moved its home from African TV to YouTube in 2016, aired on October 14, 2016 saying, "" African TV has covered its best and promised to improve its live broadcasting system. "" One can infer that YouTube has communication with its most influential users. YouTube Korea officials told the Hankyoreh on the phone that they have a partner team but mainly work on education or gildab, rather than on management. In addition, there are indications that the scandal is causing YouTube to gain more revenue. After the controversy broke out, YouTube also saw video clips of its violent reaction to the controversy. A good example is a video that criticizes Logan Paul's suicide video titled "" Logan Paul has finished his career. "" The video, in which a man calls Paul "" You Are a Great Dumpler, "" and "" Disgusting, Nothing to Think, "" appears on the first and records a 12 million view. Search not only for that video but actually for Logan Paul and hundreds of secondary works, including ' Letter to Logan Paul ' and ' My Response to Logan Paul Image '. Some of them even edited some of the body images they were affected by. Huffpost America called this a ' chain reaction to YouTube's revenue creation.

The online media box said it is ' YouTube's playful culture that values shocking images. ' In Korea, numerous problems have been stemming from the influence of various platforms, including YouTube, African TV, Facebook Live and Twich, on video consumption cultures.

"As the U.S. announced plans to launch the Cheollian-2A, a weather satellite, in earnest in 2020, the Naro Space Center announced that it will launch a manned mission to the moon in 2018, it announced the start of its space exploration. The U.S. plans to participate in the month`s planning, including Japan and Europe, and even Russia. In addition, space powers such as China and India are also making more and more independent space missions available. The year 2018 is expected to accelerate the pace of global challenges and cooperation to get into space. This year, the nation is paying keen attention as it is about to launch its first Korean-driven rocket and the Chollian II. First, a test launch will be performed to verify the performance of Korean rocket engines in October. The test projectile is a projectile designed to verify the performance of a 75-ton liquid engine applied to the first and second stages of the Korean Space Launch Vehicle`s first and second stages through flight tests. The ground test of a 75-ton engine to be used in the test projectile is complete. Currently, a test projectile certification model is being built at Naro Space Center. A total of three models are developed, one for each of the systems development model, certification model, and flight model ; the currently being built, for example, to verify the performance of the projectile, its function, interface, and operation. Same model that will be tested for launch. The engineers are assembling a model certified by Korean test projectiles (left). I can imagine the flight of Cheollian-2A, a weather satellite developed with Korean technology. The Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) certified model is expected to be finished by February. Once certified models are assembled, they will go through the certification process by testing combustion tests at a test facility at Naro Space Center in South Jeolla Province. Ko Jeong-hwan, director of the Korea Space Launch Development Agency, said, Preparing a test projectile is proceeding as planned, adding that the reliability of the engine to be tested is continued to apply to Korean launch vehicles. Once the test projectile confirms the 75-ton engine performance, the four-point engine will be tied together and applied to the first stage of the Korean launch. The Korean launch vehicle is scheduled for 2020. Korean launch vehicle is a 3-stage, 300-ton practical rocket that can be launched at an altitude of 600 to 800 kilometers from the Earth's surface and is developed as a pure independent rocket technology. The Korean launch vehicle is at the center of independent space development in terms of securing independent space transportation. ▶ After launching a test projectile, Cheollian satellite 2 A will replace Chollian's mission at the end of the year. The launch will be carried out by the European Aria-5 ECA rocket. The South American French Guiana launch site is launched at 128.2 degrees above the equator.The satellite will take over Chollian, a communication, ocean meteorologist launched in 2010 with its meteorological and astronautical observatory. The satellite will have a much better observation capability than Chollian No. 1. Resolution is more than 4 times, and observation cycles are more than tripled from 30 to 10 minutes. The number of observation channels is also more than tripled from five to 16. Choi Jae-dong, head of the Korea Aerospace Research Institute's geostationary and geostationary complex satellite system, said, If launched, we could improve weather observation and weather forecast accuracy, and surveillance of unusual weather phenomena and forecast capability on the Korean Peninsula and Asia. One year after the launch of the satellite No.2, Chollian will also be launched. The B2B can also carry out surveillance of the sea surrounding the Korean Peninsula and the air environment including fine dust. The ocean observation capability of the B2B will also be more than four times better than that of Cheollian-1. Maritime observations on the Korean Peninsula are expected to help early response and effective management of maritime territories to detailed coastal disasters such as red tides, cold water belts, and fish farms. In particular, environmental pagodas, which are first introduced in the satellite Chollian, can monitor the rapid changes in the atmosphere, including the inflow of particulate matter from neighboring countries. Environmental groups can identify the presence of dust, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and polmaldehades flowing in and out of Korea. Movement monitoring of menstrual contaminants will be carried out. Based on the 30 minute hourly observations during the day, 8 to 12 observations are made according to the season. Stops for geostationary environments are also under development in the United States and Europe, all scheduled to be launched after 2019. If the satellite is launched first, it will be recorded as the world`s first geostationary observatory. The government's plan to send a spacecraft to orbit the moon has been revised to 2020. The government agreed last year with the research and development site's opinion that the moon exploration project needs to be rescheduled and said it would focus on strengthening the technology rather than focusing on the schedule. The moon exploration schedule was not realized until 2018, when the Korean government set the first stage of the project five years earlier without collecting opinions from research sites. As the development period has become reality, the research and development project sites are evaluated to have more time to rest. Hang Woo-yeon will complete preliminary designs for the moon probe, the first stage of its design, before the end of this year and start detailed designs to finalize detailed missions.The project to develop a test lunar lead (KPLO) involves a budget of 1978 billion won and will work with NASA. The launch vehicle was selected for the United States Space Company's Falk-9 rocket. The nation operates satellites in Earth's low-orbit orbit and in a geostationary orbit, but it has never sent a spacecraft in orbit farther. Based on the satellite technologies they have accumulated so far, 70 percent of the core technologies needed to explore the Moon are secured. However, new technologies needed for space exploration beyond the Earth's orbit, such as deep space communication and deep space navigation, must be developed. In this regard, working with NASA in the United States can be very helpful.The government is planning to secure technologies to explore the Moon and to analyze its environment and resources on the moon through the first phase of a moon exploration project that goes into 2020.An independent lunar exploration, which uses Korean missiles after the pilot project, is expected to take shape in a basic plan to promote the development of the third space launch, said Hang Woo-yeon, an official at the Korea Aerospace Research Institute.Former Bon-hyuk Correspondent /nbgkoo@heraldcorp.comWhat would it be like to meet Pope Francis in front of you?

"[Donga.com] Deadly security problems were discovered shaking the foundations of the modern CPU industry. Using bugs on the CPU, hackers can steal passwords and sensitive data from users.There are two bugs detected. The names are Meltdown and Spectre. A bug that can take a peek into the data in the applications that the CPU is processing by utilizing a fatal security flaw in the CPU. It contains general unencrypted data, as well as passwords stored in a web browser, e-mail or instant messaging. It includes a photo of a person's secret, and sensitive work documents on a PC and smartphone.< Meltdown and Spector > (Source : IT Dong-A) Meltdown and Spector were discovered by senior Google Security Technology Team (Google Project Zero) Jane Horn and security experts in the industry. Google announced the bug to major CPU manufacturers such as Intel, AMD and ARM six months ago (June 1, 2017). It is to solve the problem through patches. The company posted a report on January 3 on its blog stating that the bugs could cause fatal security problems. The details of the bug's status will be revealed at the end of January when the patch is complete.The flowdown is a security vulnerability that takes advantage of bugs in ' OoOE ' technology, which is now applied to Intel CPUs. With a meltdown, an application collapses entirely of an existing hardware security structure that failed to access the cache memory of the CPUs for security. That's why they named the bug "" Downfall. "" With Meltdownberg, a malicious application (hacking application) made by a hacker is immediately able to access the user's system memory. The gate is basically wide open to steal the user's data. A meltdown can occur on any Intel CPU with non-sequential command processing techniques that are theoretically problematic. This is true for all Intel CPUs sold on the market since 1995 (except for low-rate atom processors that did not write the command). Google's research team identified the software as a greenwell architecture released in 2011. The meltdown does not occur on the CPUs of Bergra AMD and ARM because of problems with the non-sequential command processing technology Intel is using.The meltdown happens not just with PCs for end users but also with infrastructure for cloud computing. Cloud companies using Intel CPUs and Seatrix Jen hypervisors are especially vulnerable. Intel CPU has 99.8 % of the data center market, and Jen hypervisors are also tripling the virtualization market with VM ware and hyper-V. In fact, any cloud service provider could experience security issues. It has been known that the use of Linux docker containers could be affected by the meltdown.Spector is a security vulnerability that exploits bugs that occur with countless commands embedded in the CPU. The bugs allow hacking programs to look inside memory containing other applications. Although the security architecture does not collapse entirely like the meltdown, some of the data being processed by an application can be exposed to hackers. The spectrometer is very hard to track what commands are used to generate the bug and what needs to be done to solve it under certain circumstances. That's why he named the bug "" Ghost. ""Because of its lack of response, Google has not revealed the cause and how the spectrometer works. However, it was confirmed that an attack on one virtual machine had direct access to the memory of the host machine that was holding that virtual machine, and also to the memory of the other running virtual machine. This is a fatal bug that shakes the foundations of the multi-tenant architecture that currently maintains cloud computing. Spector can occur on any modern processor that has theoretically large numbers of instructions. This is the latest processor from all CPU manufacturers, including Intel, AMD and ARM. Google announced that it found Spectorberg on the latest processors from Intel, AMD and ARM.Amazon, MS and Google have already solved ... What about legacy operating system users? I explained it in a long, technical way, but I can actually sum it up easily from the memory on the CPU. Since it is a problem with the CPU (hardware), it is also difficult to solder with the software technique. The hardware problem itself must be solved.Since Google notified CPU manufacturers of the bug on June 1 of last year, CPU manufacturers have also begun working on the problem. Intel has developed patches to solve the meltdown by working with Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft (MS), Google, and Red Hat. The solution was simple. It has disabled the problem of non-sequential command processing techniques.Cloud services currently provided by AWS, Microsoft and Google have been patched up. Companies using cloud services can address this problem by updating their operating system to the latest version and rebooting the service. Red Hat Linux can also resolve the flow-down by downloading the latest patch.Security patches for lay users were also released. Windows 10, Mac OS High Sierra, and the latest Android operating system (which was released and delivered to the manufacturer in December) can be updated to avoid a meltdown. Security patches for spectrum are currently under development. However, the release of security patches for lay users is limited to the latest operating system. Older operating system users are still forced to remain vulnerable to melt down and spectrums.< CPU > (Source : IT Dong-A) = After the user's share melt down and the spectrometer was revealed, Intel and AMD issued an official statement with their future security measures, including an updated version of their plans. However, controversy arose over the explanation rather than the method to solve the damages of users. Intel said it was also found by rival CPU manufacturers as well as the company, but the importance of the problem lies in the flatdown than the spectrometer found solely by Intel CPUs. AMD did not use the problem of non-sequential command processing technology, so it did not experience problems with AMD CPUs, the company said. In a melt-down, it is "" fact, "" but there is no mention of Spector.In particular, Intel experienced degradation in performance with disabling its non-sequential command processing technology to solve the problem. Non-procedural command processing is at the heart of modern CPU technology. By disabling the command, Intel CPUs can experience performance degradation of up to 30 %, according to the UK's IT message register.This performance penalty is more damaging to cloud computing and service hosting providers than to end users. Cloud computing leverages nearly 100 % performance at all times using virtualization technologies that divide apps and process across infrastructure. A little CPU's performance penalty is bound to make the entire performance drop significantly. With more than 99 % of the server and data center market shares, Intel's CPU has experienced this problem, forcing cloud computing providers to see hardware performance drops dramatically. Cloud companies promise to provide their customers with a consistent performance through service-level agreement. The only way to keep the agreement after security patches is to deploy additional infrastructure. Additional infrastructure costs will all come under cloud pressure.No official announcement has been made of the extent to which the performance of the end-user PC will suffer due to the down-and-down security patch. Once confirmed through benchmark programs such as Sysmark, there is only a slight degradation. However, it is uncertain how much loss there will be in running the actual program. Attention should be paid to the experiences of users who appear after patches are complete.The inappropriate behavior of Intel CEO is also being criticized. Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Crochanik sold 888,9878 shares in stock except for the minimum 250,000 shares that Intel chief executive officer must hold on Nov. 29. Shares in Intel plunged from $ 46.5 to $ 43.9 after the Meltdown and Spector was unveiled. As events develop in the future, it is possible that the value of the shares will fall further. CEO Crochanik is Intel CEO, who knows Meltdown and Spector better than anyone. Such a man selling shares in the company's face is hardly immune from the suspicion of insider trading. Internal trade means that an employee or major shareholder of a company deals with a company's stock using sensitive information that is not disclosed to the public.zero@donga.com for the IT message of Donga.com, ▶ Facebook for the Dong-A Ilbo, Donaldo Ilbo, SOONDonga.com, and the Facebook Corporation,"
"▽ New apartment sale price index fluctuation rate. data : Prices of apartments in the first week of New York are on the decline. According to the National Day Apartment Price Trend announced by the Korea Institute of Standards and Technology on July 4, sales of apartments and apartments were up 0.02 % and rental costs 15.7 %. The price of the won increased by 0.01 percent on Jun-ju and that of the lowered rental price by 0.01 percent. Nationwide sales rose this week after it remained firm for two consecutive weeks last month and then shifted upward in the last week. As a result of the increase in the key interest rates, the debt payment burden will grow this year and the transfer tax system will be enforced during April. In addition, as the discussion on the property tax reform was underway, the apartment market has been holding a cautious attitude since early this year. However, as the Seoul rally widened, it was analyzed that the nation's average sales and sales prices rose this week despite the local downturn. Seoul saw its total increase in the number of its apartments to 0.26 percent from Jeonju to the same period. Thanks to the rising tendency in Seoul, the metropolitan area also saw a rise of 0.09 percent from Jeonju (0.07 percent). Seoul saw its sales volume decline in three Gangnam districts (Gangnam, Seocho and Songpa) as some of its demands after the capital gains taxes were enforced in April, but continued to rise last week. While some air demand increased to enter the three Gangnam districts in Gwangjin-Seongdong-gu, Seoul's Gangbuk area (0.11 percent), Mapo, Eunpyeong, and Gangbuk districts decreased due to the off-season. Gangnam District (0.39 %) rose in Gangnam and Yangcheon-gu, with the school district in good condition, while Geumcheon-gu saw a decline in price, and Gangdong-gu in Seoul and Yeongdeungpo-gu in Seoul. Fat (- 0.05 percent) continued its decline in Jeonju. Daejeon and Daegu had relatively small supply but the school district rose slightly, mostly in good parks. Busan remained flat or declined in all districts as large-scale new apartments were scheduled to be built by next year. The local area fell in the wake of the depressed local industry and an increase in supply. Prices of sales by major cities and provinces are on the rise in Jeonnam (15.7 percent), Daejeon (0.01 percent), and Daegu (0.01 percent). While Kyung-Nam (- 0.14 %), Chungnam (- 0.11 %), and Gangwon (- 0.09 %) remained flat, the figures showed a decline. Meanwhile, rental prices across the nation have continued to fall since late last year. Rental rental demand continues in areas with high preference to residents in areas that are convenient to get off work or areas with large subway station areas. However, demand is falling, especially in areas where rental housing for new apartments has accumulated or the local economy has slowed. The capital area has fallen by 15.7 percent. Incheon and Gyeonggi Province saw their performance decline by 0.07 percent and that of Seoul decreased by 0.09 percent, but only Seoul (15.7 percent) continued to rise. The Seoul Gangbuk area (0.02 percent) fell from Yongsan-gu due to the deterioration of residential and central Seoul's repair operations, but increased from Seongbuk-gu, where traffic conditions improved due to the opening of a light rail vehicle. Gangnam district (0.05 percent) dropped in Songpa district, where the price of old apartments was accumulated, while the district air demand increased in Gangnam district and Yangcheon-gu district. Fat decreased by 0.03 %. The drop was reduced from Jeonju (- 15.7 %). New high-demand Ulsan, Gyeongsang Province and Gangwon Province continued to suffer declines. Sejong's rise widened when prices recovered in last year's large-scale residential areas such as Dodam-dong and Jongchon-dong. Gwangju rose with a temporary imbalance between supply and demand near industrial and district preferred areas. Rents per major trial rose by 0.65 % in Sejong and 0.08 % in Gwangju. Jeju Island, Daegu and North Jeolla Province remained unchanged, while Gangwon (- 0.15 percent), Ulsan (- 13.1 percent), and Gyeongnam (- 0.11 percent) declined.▶ Go straight to the NewsBig MSI Stock List.

"" I wanted to write a story about breathing with my readers, "" said Shin Hyo-ryeong, a reporter at the Seoul International Association for the Anniversary of the Publishing House of Heo Young-man. It may add up to 30 million won, but it may decrease. '' The investment amount of 30 million won was divided by 6 million won each and invested directly according to the advice of the advisory group. A total of five advisory groups on investment are three individual investors who won the stock market event, a system investment firm using Robo-Advisor and an investment advisory firm. There are two main themes. It contained general stories about stocks and the actual process of investing in stocks.I want to talk about investing ultimately, he said, now makes 8 percent. It would seem like it would take more revenue to get a reaction from our readers.Whether you're a novice investor who's just become interested in stocks, or an existing investor who's already begun to invest, the "" Yes, "" the popular channel "" Heoyeong, "" was ' Yes, "" last year, and provided ' Yes, "" and "" Yes, there were 30 million lessons on the Internet.She explained, "" I started stock cartoons because I heard I lost more money from stock than from stock, "" and explained that "" investing in stocks would be a good hobby at first.

"" When I was at the office every day and looked at the computer screen, I could see stocks going to fail and cartoons were ready to fail. ' She said, ' It could have been difficult to avoid starting the project again. ' However, due to his active commitment to solving the problem, he got help from experts and ended up starting the first real world investment cartoon.For this work, he studied nearly 40 books and met some 30 experts on stock market and investment. He broke the mold of an existing comic book that was based on a fictional story and tried something novel. In fact, the author himself, who has taken part in the stock market, is making the results of his investment public by immediately telling the readers about the current status of the stock market.It is easy to think of stock cartoons that are full of deception, a plot and a plot, he stressed, I wanted to tell the market`s live story quite differently.Heo also revealed his difficulties in disclosing the investment process and the results of the money gains and losses. `` It would be okay to be the first in the investment advisory group, but it would be bad to be the one with the ranking down, '' he said, It was two weeks ago when I printed a comic strip of individual grades. It is sensitive and very careful.Other points that investment advisory groups recommend are the difference in the trade patterns, and different points of view. To make it easier to see the investment, we have monthly cumulative return graphs and the return rates of our advisory boards at the end of each chapter : "" The story comics will tell you what they are going to be, but they don't have that period.

""▽ New Sis=Lee Young-Hwan : At the second seminar room of the National Assembly Hall in Yeouido on July 4, National Assembly Councilman Lee Dong-Cheon, the ruling party's platform for unification, and the right, is attending a debate. The ruling party posted a statement on July 2, 2008 on its website 20hwan@newsis.com on whether to review the sunshine policy and whether to dissolve sunshine policy by engaging the United New Democratic Party (UNDP). As the sunshine policy is directly linked to diplomats and security officials who are considered to have the biggest difference in identity between the two parties, it is noteworthy whether it will lead to a conflict in the process of integrating the two parties. Vice President Choi Hong-jae of the Right-party Policy think tank said in a report released before a National Unification Forum seminar at the National Assembly on Monday, "" The spirit is needed to be re-evaluated. "" Choi added, We should first look into whether the concept of sunshine or reciprocity should be explained in the new manifesto. In fact, they should exclude the sunshine policy from the new party's manifesto. He was then moved to seminar ""There was an inevitable aspect left the Sunshine Policy is right and wrong"" side, "" It was a side of the (功), and dj the Sunshine Policy is (Kim Dae-jung, former president).Wouldn't give up nuclear weapons, 'I will help North Korea', 'don't intend to.' high with.

Honam be if there is no "" Kim Dae-jung, former president is a member of his in-house tonghapa idongseop We even call DJ Honam, saying, If I touch the sunshine policy, the capital area will be wiped out. Even if our party is in the right, it will be wiped out. `` The sunshine policy is one that should be pursued in the future but should not be beneficial to the North's nuclear development, but should be considered in terms of humanitarian aspects, '' he said in his platform policy, which is quite difficult. Rep. Shin Yong-hyun, who is also a unitarianist, also said, "" I don't think it's possible to say no, "" adding, "" The sunshine policy has changed the traditional paradigm of human rights toward North Korea, and that's why we think it. "" Regarding the assessment that the sunshine policy was a failed one, Shin said, It is not just North Korea`s fault, but the South Korean government failed to consistently implement the sunshine policy, contributing to the strong impression that it has produced today. Rep. Lee Eon-joo, head of the National Unification Forum, said, There is no sunshine policy in the current constitution. But it is just an engagement tone, Rep. Lee Dong-seop said. Whether the sunshine policy code is included in the National Assembly, where the ruling camp is the backbone of the party's political spectrum, including former GNP Chairwoman Park Jie-won, is sensitive. In addition, a National Assembly Vice Speaker Park Joo-sun that were classified as a neutral faction, also a former secretary of the president secretary in the Kim Dae-jung administration, such as sunshine policy, is simply the opposition.The trademark, dubbed the 'cloth (Park Jie-won, Chung Dong-young, Chun Jung-bae and Chung and Park)' of the problem the other party to end with destructive power are a major issue for lawmakers. In addition, about half of the members of the People's Party are in Honam. In recognition of this, Ahn called himself a "" DJ successor "" to the correct party, and thus officially drew the line as a "" Taeho-nam""person. In the end, depending on how the sunshine policy issues are dealt with, the consolidated power set by the former party members ' votes could face difficulties again. Rep. Lee Eon-joo, a member of the two negotiating group with the right party, met reporters shortly after the seminar and found that `` How to deal with the sunshine policy '' is not in the code itself. And the party is not likely to oppose the engagement policy on North Korea, which is its spirit. "" However, the sunshine policy was adopted by the ruling party and the people's unified opposition party. imzero@newsis.comA climber discovered surprising sight when she took a cloud view of the sky at Mount Tsukuba in Japan.

"Highlight terminal information on this ticket and text message…Strength information on promotion and information (Yonhap news, Sejong = Yonhap news) : Incheon Airport Terminal 2 will open on the 18th, and return to and from the wrong terminal on the terminal. Strengthen terminal guidance and promotion on electronic tickets (e-tickets, e-tickets) and text messages to be shipped after reservations so that no passengers are confused with the terminal.The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport reported this at the International Summit on the Preparation for International Affairs at Incheon International Airport's Sejong Building on July 18. When the second terminal opens on July 18, Incheon Airport will operate with two terminal systems. Two terminals are used exclusively by four airlines, Korean Air, Delta Airlines, Air France, and KLM, and Asiana Airlines and other low-cost domestic airlines use existing terminal 1. Since the two terminals are located about 20 minutes away by car, they can miss the plane if they are mistaken for the terminal. To prevent such confusion, the ministry has been actively promoting the program since last month by launching a variety of channels, including TV, newspapers, radio and the Internet, to directly visit airlines and terminals. In addition, terminal information on the ticket, which is provided at the time of airline ticket reservation, will be enhanced to provide guidance, such as by increasing the size of letters and using different colors. Text messages sent from airlines and travel agencies three hours before departure are requested to include the words, "" Please come to the second passenger terminal. ""▽ Reinforcing Guide to this ticket terminal [Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport] When approaching the terminal, an airline terminal layout drawing is attached inside the bus to and from the airport railway, and when approaching the terminal, a terminal related announcement is aired. To prevent disruption of passengers who drive their cars to Incheon Airport, the terminal marking guiding airlines will also be tightened, including road signs and motorway lighting (VMS). In addition, when searching Incheon Airport, select terminal 1, terminal 2 and upgrade the features to be guided by the terminal and the airline by the vehicle navigation company. Even with this guide, passengers who visit the terminal incorrectly can take a direct shuttle bus every five minutes and go to and from terminal 1-2. By shuttle bus, you can reach the other terminal in 18 to 22 minutes. An airport railway running every 12 minutes enables you to reach another terminal in about 20 minutes. Korean Air will temporarily operate check-in counters at terminal 1 for passengers who incorrectly arrive at terminal 1 and issue special cards to enable quick entry into or out of terminal (.) Also, the car gives valet parking priority for passengers who arrive accidentally using the vehicle.Examples of terminal information such as using an electronic board [Land, Infrastructure and Transport Ministry] 2. To respond to departure customers returning to terminal 2, one terminal is also parked at the parking lot of terminal 2. To minimize confusion stemming from the opening of the second terminal, we will arrange a total of 102 advisory personnel at the shuttle bus stop, railway boarding area and parking areas to guide transportation, ministry officials said. dkkim@yna.co.kr. Report to the reporter and ask for information on 1:1. Report on the latest trend : 119. Report to the fire brigade on radio. In the aftermath of the tragedy, which was revealed by the bereaved families, calls to 119 and recordings of radio fire were made to provoke such suspicions. Bereaved families are pointing out the problem of the fire department's rescue system that failed to make the most of the "" Golden Time, "" and are urged to investigate the truth. According to the radio recordings of the fire department that were released on July 21 by the bereaved family's countermeasure committee at Jecheon Fire Station, there were no calls made between 4:02 p.m. and 20 minutes p.m. Given that the first fire report is due at 3:53 p.m., it is the time for the "" Golden Time "" to rescue survivors. Communication between the two areas is common to the scene of the 119 case, but there is no indication of the situation at the scene. In particular, information concerning sauna on the second floor, which has had the highest number of casualties, was not mentioned in radio contact with the fire site. The bereaved family members were quoted as requesting the joint fire team keep the recordings of their radio messages, saying, I don`t know why the most important time for fighting fires and saving lives was not disclosed. "" We excluded radio recordings that can not be heard because of high interference or noise, and that is where the bereaved families raise their suspicions, "" an official at the fire department explained. However, the recording of the 911 call at the time shows that the fire department can not explain the incident easily. A woman who was trapped at a sauna on the second floor at 3:59 p.m. was asked to rescue her when she re-configured the day of fire based on the call to 119 that she reported to the bereaved family. The staff member who received the call said, "" We shared the fact that the relief staff is on the second floor. "" He explained, "" I tried to let the scene know this by radio, but I didn't respond, and I called the fire inspector who is the unit commander at 4:04 p.m. as a next best option and reported the situation on the second floor. "" But when I called Jecheon Fire Station Central Security Center at a similar time, I don`t know how many people are in the (building) at the moment, 119 office officials said they were trapped upstairs. At 4:09 p.m., another report was received saying that she was confined with her life in the sauna lounge on the second floor. When we lost contact with Mr. B, he said, It looks like we are trapped on the second floor. Could you tell her to get in the locker room? We have many requests here, the office told employees. However, at 4:19 p.m., a phone call with the head of the field's command told him to be careful about searching lives, but it did not mention anything related to the second floor. It is questionable whether the sharing of information between the situation room and the actual site was conducted properly. The same was true of the scene when information was not shared properly. The first fire truck arrived at the scene of the fire, but was at the fire brigade and rescue teams (4 people) arrived at 4:06 p.m. The rescue team rescued one of the survivors who were hanging from the building with an air mat and set out for an underground search instead of the second floor, which was flooded with rescue requests. "" I don't know whether the radio was not working or not, but I didn't get any radio concerning the two-story structure, "" the commander said. "" I also told local authorities that I had nothing to do with the building. If I had heard anything about the second floor, I would have definitely left, adding, Without knowing the situation, I decided that the basement, which can be completely isolated depending on the rescue manual, would be the search area first. Amid the confusion, rescue teams tried to enter the second floor at 4:37 p.m., well after the fact. When we climbed from the basement to replenish the oxygen tank for rescue workers, we were first instructed by the fire chief to enter the second floor and installed ladders, the rescue chief said. In other words, although the sauna victims on the second floor longed for rescue, their rescue was delayed due to poor communication inside the fire department, resulting in the large-scale disaster in which 20 people die. We have informed the situation room of the second floor information in a way that we can deliver, however, we don`t know at this point why such information was not shared at the scene, fire officials said. jeonch@yna.co.kr"

Operating system is also influential not only on Windows, Mac, but also Linux.Security experts warned that hackers could steal information from passwords, browsers, e-mail, photos, and documents if they use the defect.Whereas the flowdown only affects Intel chips, the spectrometer has a wider impact. That is because they took advantage of the design flaws that processor manufacturers have used over the past two decades.Foreign news agencies reported that this change not only affects AMD chips but also many of the chips that use ARM designs.■ Cloud service providers such as Google and Amazon have also begun to experience a meltdown due to emergencies. Because it can take not only kernel memory but also the actual memory on the PC. Servers linked to cloud computer networks were also exposed to hacking risks.However, the spectrometer is expected to have a significant impact on the problem of the chip design over the past two decades.Paul Kotzer, president of Rambers-based cryptography research firm Cryptographics Research, stressed, although the meltdown is a more urgent crisis, the spectrometer affects nearly every microprocessor.He also warned that this happened because of the excessive emphasis on speed when designing new chips.As a result, not only PC users but also operators of cloud computing services such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft (MS) are on alert.Google and Microsoft announced that they had updated the system in the morning of July 3, shortly after the crash was reported.The problem is that there is no simple way to fix these flaws.Security experts warned that software patches to combat the melt down could reduce computer performance by up to 30 percent. It is a serious situation for PC users who prefer to download from online services at a fast pace.Another defect, Spector, has no proper cure. To avoid spectrums, the processor design needs to be redesigned.Amazon also told its Web service users on the same day, "" This defect has been a potential problem in the modern processor architecture for more than 20 years.

"Bulguksa. [Photo source : Korean Tourism Organization] However, Bulguksa Temple in nearby Gyeongju, located in the same active single-story area, remained firm.View of picture that one of Dabotap Nanganseok Bulguksa was twisted out of shape during earthquake of 5.8. A year ago in Gyeongju, where Bulguksa Temple was located on September 12, 2016, there was an earthquake of 5.8. One of the balustrades of Dabotap, Bulguksa temple, was twisted, and three tiles from the main temple fell off.Officials with Dabotap Nanganseok, which was hit by the 5.8 earthquake that hit Gyeongju on September 12, 2016. [Photo Source : Yonhap] This news made headlines. Bulguksa Temple was not about the damage of Bulguksa. Bulguksa Temple was flexible because it survived strong earthquakes.What is the secret to the anti-seismic design of Bulguksa? Bulguksa Temple's secret is ' softness '. In the anti-seismic method of a building, there are two structures, one that stands firm against vibrations and the other that stands firm, whereas the structure refers to vibration dispersion energy.Seismologist agree that Bulguksa Temple in Gyeongju is an incredibly scientific earthquake-proof building.Did the Silla people 1,200 years ago think that Bulguksa Temple was to be built in the most unstable and active region in the Korean Peninsula? Silla's record of the earthquake in Gyeongju was well known to the Silla people.Silla people built the building with the Grengley technique of cutting artificial stone into pieces to keep it fit with monkfish on the rough granite of natural stone to keep Bulguksa Temple afloat.Designed to absorb vibration, the technique of stone pillars at Bulguksa is designed to be applied to the building of a traditional house by trimming the columns to the shape of a cornerstone - making them close together with the top of every floor - stone.Bulguksa Temple which was designed to absorb shaking, built with the Greengcheok jeon of Geollak Hall, contains lots of energy that is easily carried out between stone structures during earthquakes. To prevent the stones built inside the stone pillars from being shaken, Dongtldol regularly was inserted into the masonry unit to provide more anti-seismic effects.Just as lightweight, high-impact wooden architecture can withstand earthquakes, Bulguksa Temple was designed by applying the weaving method used in wooden construction to create granite.So, there's one more point to be made here. Why did Japan, who had always been thoroughly prepared for an earthquake, cause massive damage during the Kobe earthquake in 1995 and the Fukushima nuclear plant accident during the East Japan earthquake in 2011?It was not an earthquake on the left or the right, but an earthquake on the right or left that was more difficult to deal with even modern construction methods, and it is important to note that the Fukushima nuclear accident was caused by a tsunami.Silla people built Bulguksa on the land they thought would be earthquake-struck. Why did we, descendants of Silla, build nuclear power plants and waste disposal facilities in the land? What if an earthquake were more powerful than the one in neighboring Japan? I don't want to be a worse descendant than my ancestors, but I'm worried sick.Kim Jong-hwa, reporter of Yangnak University, justin@asiae.co.kr"

According to the report, the ancestors of Native Americans (American Indians) were East Asian who lived about 36,000 years ago, and they first set foot on U.S. land through Siberia and Alaska about 20,000 years ago. The date of the first anniversary of its founding fathers, as well as the year of the first foot on American soil, was thousands of years earlier than before.Ben Porter, professor of anthropology at the University of Alaska and a team of scientists at the University of Corpenhagen, Denmark's Center for Geography and Genomy, when they found the skeleton cells in their DNA cells Genes from the genome were compared with 167 modern human beings from Asia, Europe, and America, and gene variation over time was traced back to what happened later. The research team announced the announcement to Nature on July 3, detailing who first came to North America and when they immigrated to the North America.Studies show that Native Americans are descendants of an unknown human who lived in East Asia about 36,000 years ago. The unknown East Asian had all the hallmarks of many of the present ancestors in East Asia, including the Han Chinese people, Porter said in an e-mail interview. Dr. Jose Victor Moreno Mayor, PhD of the Danish Center for Geogenetics and Genomics, also wrote in an e-mail interview that "" one-third of the Native Americans ' genomes came from the ancient northeastern Eurasian people, "" and "" active exchange occurred between them "" They gradually moved northeast after having lost contact with other human beings since about 25,000 years ago, and advanced to Siberia and Alaska about 20,000 years ago. And some of them went to U.S. soil and became what is now Native American.The newly identified route of travel for Native Americans. East Asian nationals have moved beyond Bering, which is 36,000 years old and have since moved 25,000 years ago. - The time of Science, it was a severe ice age, with the entire area north of New York and Siberia covered with a few kilometers of thick ice. Due to the glaciers, the sea levels decreased more than 100 meters, with Siberia and Alaska linked to a prairie called Bering Strait. Native American ancestors entered what is now ice-covered Alaska and Canada along the plains. Professor Porter said, "" The fact that Native Americans migrated through the Bering famine was previously thought to have been an archaeological study, but it is estimated that it would have taken us as early as 15,000 years ago to make inroads into the U.S. ""The research team also stated the new ways in which humans have spread throughout North America. They are now thousands of years, along the north coast of California to move south and thick ice and out of about 16,000 years ago, split into two factions here again.In their North and South America to the continent.Park Jong-hwa, a professor of bioscience at UNIST University in North Korea, confirmed in response to this research that the genome of a fossil dating back to 7,700 years was disampled at Akmamun Cave in the north of the Korean Peninsula.Meanwhile, some researchers have found the theory of ' migration to America via the South Pacific Island ' unreliable. South Pacific immigrants some hypothesis is indigenous in Latin America such as Amazon, the South Pacific, including Papua New Guinea, the South Pacific island, and features came from a similar assumption as a human race.Residents via the beach and east of South America by boat and canoe visitor book that she had settled in U.S. shores. `` The current conclusion is that the South Pacific migration hypothesis is both genetically and archeological, '' Professor Porter said.How did you get to this research?- Ten years have passed since the site of the latest discovery. We have also been studying ecology adaptation for more than 20 years in high latitudes. The study is part of that.2. How is the study different from the results of the Native Americans migrating from Bering Kia? Is it an earlier time?- Our study is consistent with the theory of migration through Bering Kia. Remember that Native American ancestors must be genetically distinct from the other Asian humans. It is not necessarily Bering Kia. I sounded out the possibility that it was Northeast Asia. As for entering the United States, our data is said to have gone in between 20, 000 and 5,000 years ago. The archaeological research results for Bering Kia are close to 15,000 years old.I heard that there were Native American ancestors in East Asia 36,000 years ago. Is it related to the recent study that led to the rapid transfer of human beings in Asia?- Our research focuses on the fact that humans existed in East Asia 36,000 years ago and mixed with others until 25,000 years ago. It was then mixed with some of the Northeast Asian people between 25,000 and 20,000 years ago. That means they are still in Asia.Our findings raise two scenarios. One is that two separate human beings (the ancient Bering famine and the Native Americans) who separated 20 thousand years ago, could have crossed the Bering Kia line more than 16,000 years ago. The second is likely to have been out of Bering Kia and Native Americans 20 thousand years ago. Current archaeological evidence supports the former. Who were the human beings 36,000 years ago? Was it the Han Chinese?- Han referred only to as East Asian representative. Native American ancestors are closely related to the groups of East Asian people. Of course, that was a long time ago.5. How is it different from the Science paper 2015, which says some Native American have genes from the South Pacific people. What is the South Pacific migration plan?- The South Pacific migration theory lacks both genetic and archaeological evidence. When the ancient Bering Strait hungry people were in Bering Kia for an important period 20,000-10,000 years ago, it is unlikely that other immigrants existed. Through today's evidence, the west coast of North America had no glaciers and would have been able to move southward 16,000 years ago. An inland route without ice would have been possible 15,000-10,000 years ago. There are several scenarios in which they could have migrated from the Americas after crossing the Bering Strait.[NEEDS RESERVATOR] Yoon Shin-young ashilla@donga.com][ Earlier today (July 4), the Coast Guard captured a Chinese fishing boat illegally fishing in the waters of Shinan, South Jeolla Province. But it was more of a battlefield than a crackdown.

"The first four days of the new Jongno Bus-One were opened after the construction began on July 31 and a half of the final buses were completed in Seoul in April, due to the lack of construction on the speed of buses during rush hour. The intersection of Jongno district and Seoul City Hall was still open on July 3. Two cars were in use, one containing a dump truck and two construction vehicles. The van was rattling away the words "" bus lane "" and other traditional lanes carved into the asphalt floor. "" It took us about 10 minutes to get there by blocking the road, "" said Kim (41), adding, "" It took me about 10 minutes to get there.◇ The empty doors were opened at a faster pace, and citizens welcomed the decision, saying it would make Jongno a public transportation friendly street. The Seoul Metropolitan Government began construction on September 15 last year of the 2.6km stretch from the intersection of Sejongdae to Heunginjimun Gate intersection. The existing eight lanes will be reduced to six lanes and a bus only section will be installed to open by the end of the year. The work was slower than expected. The supply and demand of the materials was not good, and the weather was bad. It was not possible to complete the project before the end of the year. After much consideration, the city concluded that it should open its doors to completion. Complaints of inconvenience over the heavy traffic during construction began earlier in the day, a city official said.The city opened its central bus lanes on December 31 last year to meet the goal of opening its doors by the year. The communication is much smoother with buses that used to drive in two end lanes now use the central lanes. Park Joo-hun (26), a job preparation student who was waiting for a bus on Jongno 1-ga, said, "" Only a week ago, the bus was blocked, but it has been a hole since I found a bus. "" According to the city government, the average speed of buses running from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. that day was 15.1 kilometers per hour, a 10 percent increase from the same day last year (13.7 kilometers per year).The speed of the car was slower than before the construction, but it was better than when it was done. Last year, Jongno was the number one spot among drivers who avoided meeting the top spot, said taxi driver Min Kyung-ho (68), saying, During construction work last year, the speed is much faster than when it opened. The average speed of the vehicles passing through Jongno 2-ga was only 12.4 kilometers per hour when construction was in full swing on September 20 last year, but the average speed of the cars in the morning was 21.6 kilometers per hour.◇ domun system is still under construction and some sections. ""excessive opening of whether or not"" citizens ' criticism Fifteen of the new stations were unpaved with cold cement. Wires and steel structures came out and were temporarily covered. Three of the eight crosswalks that they are setting up did not draw a pedestrian boat until that morning. People were rushing around unable to find the crosswalk. "" We opened it too aggressively and put the citizens at risk, "" followed suit. The city did not finish drawing a pedestrian crossing until late that evening.Cars were tangled up because the paint work was not complete. In some sections, the blue lanes, the traditional white lanes, and the new-graphed dotted lines were tangled, representing the bus lanes that were only 50 centimeters wide. As there are several lanes, some cars ran on the bus only lanes. It was confusing which lane to follow, said Lee Dong-young, 46, who was driving through Jongno with her car.Two cars with cars were used to block some of the paint work. Workers lined up in a row and made a manual effort to draw lines with a rolling pin. The same was true of drawing a crosswalk. Kang (39), who was passing by, said, It looks dangerous to work on a road that is rounding with cars, adding, It would have been better to clear it up and open it in a few more days.The city will complete the route drawing process by the end of the week and finish the station maintenance by the 10th. Final completion is possible at the end of April. This is because we can cure concrete for wrapping the cars only when it gets warmer, a city official said.

"A truck selling dried fish stands in front of a fire hydrant installed on the side of a road in Gangbuk-gu, Seoul yesterday. The power-and-lock locks of motorized wheelchairs are also installed in the same fire hydrant. Fire hydrant seems unable to use even in the near vicinity (photo above). Firefighters in 2014 at a fire scene in Boston, USA, connected hoses to a illegally parked BMW car window. Public opinion is growing to remove the illegal parking, which Kim Ja-hyeon, a reporter at zion37@donga.com and the Fox News ' homepage, called "" Capture. "" Even the "" shameful "" article in the Dong-A Ilbo (see page A12), which compares the situation in Korea with the situation in which citizens face difficulties in illegally parking their cars, should not pass this time. Experts point out that this opportunity should change Korea's twisted parking culture. That means the consciousness that illegal parking should be considered a minor mistake should be fundamentally changed. Otherwise, the illegal parking that cuts off the fire truck and turns the fire hydrant into a mess is repeated.○ The fire hydrant disappeared due to illegal parking on the afternoon of July 3 in Nohae-ro, Gangbuk-gu, Seoul. A one-and-a-half ton truck loaded with dried seafood stood on its feet. The speaker was noisy with the sound of selling squid to the skin. The truck stood close on the sidewalk as close as a red hydrant. Next to the fire hydrant was a motorized wheelchair that would not last. Electric wheelchairs and fire hydrants were connected by a thick bicycle lock. `` For the last few days, we've had motorized wheelchairs tied up like that, for six to seven hours a day, '' a nearby merchant said.A truck driver, identified as Kim (51), said, It is the place to stop the traffic every time I shop. I know what is wrong with the fire hydrant. But what is the problem with keeping anything out of the way? Kim left the scene a few minutes later, with an unpleasant look on her face throughout her speech. When a fire pump car runs out of water at the scene of a fire, the only way to do so is to actually use a fire hydrant. Fire hydrants are also important when a fire truck can not get close to the fire. Here you can get close to the fire by connecting fire hoses. Therefore, all vehicles within five meters of the hydrant are prohibited from parking. If they violate the law, they will be fined 40,000-50,000 won. But in daily life, fire hydrants are treated like "" ghosts. "" The fire hydrant installed next to an officetel about 100 meters from here was "" trapped "" in a green-green iron fence. There was a door about one meter from the fire hydrant but it was locked tight with a lock. Even if there is a fire nearby, you can not use a fire hydrant without opening the door. As many people smoke in secret, a building official said, We set up a fence. I forgot to make a hole to use, explained Kim. Three cars lined the fire hydrant stand in a mall near Yonsei University in Seodaemun-gu, Seoul. There was only 50 to 60cm between the car and the hydrant. Choi (52, female), who runs a restaurant in the mall, complained, "" Even if I park my car, I can`t help cleaning it and parking it. "" Another fire hydrant was blocked by an accessory delivery vehicle for more than an hour. The license plate of the car was covered with newspaper. The late driver was rather angry, saying, How can I expect to go to downtown on weekdays to supply it? The ground-type fire hydrant installed three or four years ago is more problematic. It is the new method because fire hydrants on the road are causing difficulties for transportation. It is buried in the ground like a manhole. At first glance, it looks like a manhole cover. It has a yellow frame and a fire hydrant sign that says no parking. However, underground fire hydrants installed in narrow residential alleys are more likely to be ignored than ordinary ones.○ A major fire broke out at the demolition site of Yanghwa-ro, Mapo-gu, Seoul on July 3 to recognize the need of illegal parking = criminal. Fortunately, Golden Time was within five minutes, and the fire was put out of control. There was no casualties. Nammo firefighter Nam (38) said, Although there is always a lot of traffic near Hongik University subway station, it was easy to enter the area because there are no illegally parked vehicles in the area. An office worker who witnessed the fire said, At the time, the smoke was so bad it was hard to get around. It would have been much more dangerous if there were illegal parking. Last December, a revision to the Fire Service Act passed the National Assembly's plenary session. As a result, punishment will be tightened for all acts that disturb fire trucks starting June 27 this year. Drivers who disturb drivers such as fire trucks will be allowed a maximum fine of 2 million won. The agency is currently in the process of setting up a mandate. It will include specific standard and amount of fines. However, there are many skepticism. The road traffic law still allows the user to charge a maximum fine of 200,000 won. The problem is that the fines are not strictly enforced on the site like vehicles illegally parked at the Kyungpo 119 safety center. The problem is that illegal parking strokes are carried out. Police are currently in charge of banning parking. However, local governments are in charge of the crackdown. Local governments are often urged to step down because of lack of public petitions and manpower. It is notable when there is a local election as this year. Accordingly, it is worth considering measures to force local governments to disclose the results of their illegal parking controls. Rep. Hong Chul-ho of the Free Korea Party (National Assembly Administration and Security Committee) said, "" Although the maximum penalty limit has been raised, the actual charge is often lower due to the legal nature of administrative measures. Representing fire fighting as a crime should be established as punishment criteria for criminal penalties and not fines. We also need to tighten the basic law on fire fighting so that the courts can judge the middle and middle class rooms and impose fines of up to 2 million won, the official said.Seo Hyeong-seok, Kim Ja-hyeon, and Yoon Sol-paper, official news reporter, Facebook (The Dong-A Ilbo sole / The newspaper provided by Dong-A Ilbo), and the "" People's Association of Private News Redistributions Association, 2003 "" released in October 2006, 2008. According to Sejong City on July 4, this highway will connect Yeongi, part of the Sejong-Seoul expressway, and Cheongju Branch, part of the Deokjin-Dongdeok Expressway. It is the north of the road with an outer circulation around the administrative center of Sejong City. The total cost of the work is 89.3 billion won. Mayor Lee Chun-hee answers questions from reporters at a regular briefing at the Sejong City Hall on July 4. [Yonhap] 2006 feasibility study (B1.04) was confirmed, but the project was turned down. And then highway construction in January last year, five-year (2016 to 2020) plan of business ranked one of 25 July, and Moon Jae-in joined the local commitment and projects, while the Government.Gaining momentum. Once an express highway is built, the entire 321.2-kilometer-long Dongseo 4-axis motorway from Daesan and Dangjin, Chungnam Province to Yeongdeok, Gyeongbuk will be completed. If the feasibility study makes sense, we will be able to start a feasibility study next year, said Sejong City Mayor Lee Chun-hee at a weekly briefing at Sejong City Hall. If all procedures are clear, they will be completed by 2030. Sejong City will reflect the opinions of local residents in the preliminary feasibility study as much as possible and gather administrative power to start the project at an early stage. ▶ walden@yna.co.kr article 1:1 ▶ In the latest trends and report and your reporter [Moneytoday a gimseonghwi] [[ the 3] … New Year's message more than five months after the ceremony at a conference after the announcement of the freedom.TRANSACTION ] Moon Jae-in president of his first 100 days, Yongsan-gu, Seoul Station on Thursday after residents in the waiting area the president took office watching a news conference.A / photo : Hong Bong Jin Moon Jae-in have a president who in Cheong Wa Dae 10 a.m. on Monday invited 250 internal and foreign correspondent to publish and make a press conference in New Year message.I have.

These media outlets urged restraint, saying, "" Nuclear weapons are not the solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis, "" and expressed their anticipation over creating an atmosphere for dialogue as the communication channels between the two Koreas resume. The World Times, an English-language magazine about the Communist Party's People's Daily, warned North Korean leaders of the North Korean nuclear standoff with an editorial titled "" The nuclear button is not a solution to the North Korean nuclear crisis.

Korea`s foreign exchange reserves hit an all-time high for the second month in a row as the dollar`s weakness in the local news agency, the Seoul Economic Daily.According to the Bank of Korea (BOK) on December 4, the amount of Korea's foreign exchange reserves in late December last year increased by $ 2.28 billion to $ 378.7 billion. It rose for the second month in a row to its highest level in more than a month since November last year ($ 387.5 billion). The increase helped Korea`s foreign exchange reserves grow $ 18.17 billion during the year. The nation`s emergency foreign currency reserves are a key factor in stabilizing the exchange rate and boosting the nation's sovereign credit rating.The rise in foreign reserves was attributed to the falling dollar's worldwide value in addition to rising profits from foreign asset management, prompting the central bank to convert foreign assets held by the euro and the pound into dollars. The euro, the pound and the Australian dollar rose 0.8 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively, to 3.0 percent against the dollar in December. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which measures the value of the dollar against the currencies of the six major countries, decreased by one percent from 93.1 to 92.1. Last month, the dollar weakened market sentiment already expected, despite an interest rate hike by the U.S. central bank Federal Reserve (Fed).By type, foreign exchange holdings at the end of last year amounted to $ 368.3 billion, or 92.2 percent, or $ 358.3 billion, of the country`s securities, including government bonds, corporate bonds, and asset-backed securities. It has decreased by $ 90 million in a month. Korea`s cash deposit at the central bank and major global banks stood at $ 20.05 billion, up $ 2.02 billion from the previous month.In addition, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has the same right to withdraw special money (SDR) for Korea and the IMF's right to find exchangeable currency (IMF) for the same period was passed down to 1.82 billion dollars. At the time of purchase, the gold holdings in the books were set at $ 4.49 billion, unchanged from December.As of late November last year, Korea`s foreign exchange reserves were the ninth-largest in the world. China remained at the top with its foreign exchange reserves rising by $ 101 billion to $ 3.11193 trillion during the month. Japan followed with $ 1.23 trillion, followed by Switzerland ($ 789.9 billion), Saudi Arabia ($ 449.4 billion) and Taiwan ($ 441.4 billion). Vinnansee Correspondent Vinnanssay binthere@sedaily.com[ See also Seoul Economic Daily. According to the Health and Welfare Ministry on July 4, the maximum monthly income tax on basic pension will rise 1.9 percent to 309,000 won (299,000 won) from last year starting April. The ministry raised the basic pension plan to reflect the annual inflation rate. The purpose of the pension is to prevent the net value of the basic pension from declining and to provide an appropriate level of salary to ensure the retirement income. Looking at the National Statistical Office's annual consumer price trend, the Consumer Price Index for 2017 rose 1.9 % from 2016 to its highest level since 2012 when it was 2.2 %. The basic pension law requires the government to adjust the basic pension plan every year, taking into consideration the price and income levels of all pension subscribers. The government paid the maximum monthly premium of 200,000 won per month in July 2014 when the basic pension system was adopted, and gave a maximum rate of 202,600 won per month in 2015, which was reflected by previous year's inflation rate of 1.3 percent. The maximum monthly pension amount was later raised to 204,000 won in 2016 and to 206,000 won in 2017. Starting in September, recipients of the basic pension plan will receive a maximum monthly premium of 250,000 won. Aside from the basic annual increase in the amount of taxpayers ` money, the government is set to raise the basic pension amount to 250,000 won per month to alleviate poverty among the elderly. The government and the ruling party originally planned to raise the basic pension in April, but it has slowed to September in the process of negotiating the 2018 budget plan between the ruling and opposition parties at the end of last year. Meanwhile, starting this year, when the standard amount for basic pension payment is raised, the basic pension can be obtained if the monthly income of elderly households with single income is less than 1,130,000 won and married couples with less than 2,060 won. Single-aged households for the elderly are those that live alone or with a family without a spouse. The basic pension selection standard amount is the standard amount set at 70 % by the basic pension beneficiary among those over the age of 65, which reflects the income distribution, wage increase rate, land price, and inflation rate of the entire senior citizens. If the value of an income rating plus the amount of the asset's income converted into income is below the selected threshold, the income recognition amount could be selected as the beneficiary of the basic pension. Basic pension is paid differently depending on the size of the property and the income. If you turn 65 this year, you can apply for a basic pension from the office of the town or town concerned, the community center, or the branch of the National Pension Service, one month before your birthday.

The court only conducted its review the previous day, as the holidays continued after the extraordinary session of the National Assembly ended on July 29. The two lawmakers reportedly denied the charges during the process. The investigation is expected to gain further momentum as the prosecution successfully secured two new recruits.

"" The background of the Unconditioned Conversation on State in Tokyo? "" (Yonhap news agency) Kim Byung-kyu, a special correspondent of the U.S. and North Korea held a classified news conference in Beijing last month. It is noteworthy that such consultations between North Korea and the United States might have been the basis of the U.S. Secretary of State's "" unconditional talks. "" The Japanese daily newspaper, "" The U.S. and North Korean officials met in Beijing early last December, "" citing a number of Japanese government sources, and added, "" It appears that they discussed conditions for the resumption of talks and ways to resume.

The Hangaram, however, surmised that it is possible that Tillerson sent a signal to North Korea to resume the talks after receiving a report from Meryl. The newspaper explained that the reason why Meryl was a participant in the U.S was because North Korea's special envoy to North Korea Joseph Yun, who has been in contact with Choi Seon-hee, North Korea's Foreign Ministry, and North America's special envoy for North Korea, had less confidence. North Korea's ballistic missiles on September 15 last year is Joseph Yoon, Special Representative proposed the resumption of dialogue on the condition to 'for 60 days to stop provocation' shortly after a November 20, and the same year.Donald Trump the American president is Joseph Yoon said North Korea has overridden in a state sponsor of terrorism back channels of communication do not value it.

"- Establishment of restrooms for Natural Fermentals and Trailers - Natural Fermentation Ceremony / Type 128 Terracer - This year, the issue of leakage from the Herald Business = new generation toilet and odor treatment room caused the controversy among military personnel and the residentsThe Defense Ministry announced on July 4 that it will start operating the environmentally friendly, naturally fermented toilet and trailer-type toilet installed at outdoor training centers nationwide in order to take into consideration the characteristics of the new generation soldiers and ensure the conditions of training.Forty years after flush toilet was supplied, bird-equipped Yaji bathrooms were installed in the military and the military facilities, but the outdoor bar restrooms were located in Yaji were especially poor for decades.  Starting this year, the military's outdoor training center restrooms will be replaced by both naturally fermented restrooms and trailer-type traction restrooms. The photo shows the existing and new portable restrooms. [The Ministry of National Defense] Water supply facility was not functioning properly, causing concerns of local water source contamination and concerns about the problem of leaks and foul smells.In particular, women's restrooms were not available, which made it very difficult for female soldiers to relieve their menstrual periods during training.Because of this, some armed forces have purchased private restrooms separately, and some female soldiers have even refused to drink water during training, leading to a human rights issue.To address this challenge, the ministry reflected 18.9 billion won in total needed to improve the outdoor mobile restrooms in its 2017 budget, and applied it to the tow-in-the-nation system and the tow-room trailer system. In addition to the traditional restrooms installed in the existing training area, there were 770 natural fermentation restrooms for durability, manageability, and preference, and outdoor training where soldiers could be installed in any location other than the march and training area.A portable toilet at an outdoor training camp will create conditions where soldiers can focus on their training, the ministry said, preventing environmental pollution and other complaints. shindw@heraldcorp.com[Yonhap news photo] Prices of West Texas crude oil (WTI) for February delivery rose 0.8 percent to close at 1.45 p.m. Korean time on July 4 in electronic transactions outside New York Mercantile Exchange. WTI rose to a record high level of $ 62.14 per barrel since May 2015. It was traded at $ 68.13 per barrel (same time as February's water induction) on the London Ice Futures Exchange, and was the highest price ever since May 2015. Fears over the Middle East following Iranian protests and an improvement in economic indicators by the United States and Japan have contributed to the rise in international oil prices. If Iran, the third-largest oil producer of OPEC, loses production of crude oil, it will face a reduction in the world's supply glut worries.Others predict that the U.S., which is rapidly increasing shale oil under such conditions, could beat Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world`s largest producer of oil this year. Norwegian consulting firm Listad Energy Corp. forecast oil output to grow 10 percent year-on-year to an average of 11 million barrels a day, according to U.S. business media CNN Down. This figure is higher than the U.S. Energy Security Agency's (EIA) forecast that the daily oil production would grow to an average of 10 million barrels per day in 2018. Listad`s forecast is that with increased output, the United States will be able to surpass the output of Russia and Saudi Arabia, the world`s top two producers of oil later this year. The company analyzed that the oil price hike again led to U.S. production increase with OPEC's agreement to cut output. Fourteen OPEC members, including Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, and Russia, decided to extend their agreement to reduce their output by 1.8 million barrels a day last November to December. The instability in the Middle East, triggered by protests by the U.S. administration and Iran over what appears to be a policy of deregulating the energy market, coupled with an American energy dominance policy, was also blamed on rising unrest. U.S. production of shale has completely changed the landscape of the crude oil market, Listad Energy explained. vivid@yna.co.kr.

[Maggyeong DB] : "" Nobody is interested in a subject that teaches the fundamentals of being a good lawyer. "" I'm just busy taking courses to get my bar exam. "" "" International Business Negotiation, "" a major course opened at Seoul National University's Law School in the second semester of last year, was attended by only three students. It was on the verge of closing down. Goh Hak-soo, a professor at Seoul National University who teaches the subject, said on July 4 while speaking with the economy on a daily basis, I understand that the better I become a lawyer, the more I can use my negotiation skills, and that the negotiation theory is very different from the purpose of law school. As law school students focus only on studying for subjects because of the law-level bar exam, criticism is growing that law schools have turned into changing admission institutes. In fact, it is pointed out that the role of law schools to produce "" good quality "" lawyers is being devastated. The law school at Seoul National University (SNU) managed to check its major course records for the second semester last year, and found that the 100-percent of women who attended the "" Code of Administrative Law Practititions""and the "" Criminalism of Practice "" were more closely related to the changing times were filled with cases. This is not just the law schools at Seoul National University. The law schools, which are set to begin 10 years later this year, are "" changing over "" to the point where their original intentions are being blurred. As all of the curriculum is set to the ' Times ', the curriculum at 25 law schools nationwide is virtually identical. Law schools that wanted to make a difference by selecting the specialty areas of the system, but now have become less standardized with the opening of the law schools and the elimination of the related subjects related to Northeast Asia Trade Law. Law school students are "" all in full "" at the time of the change, with the rate of gradually dropping. The lawyers with diverse expertise and expertise are being criticized for being "" problematic "" in producing law schools, which were adopted to address the workforce waste due to accumulated ' receptions '. Unsuspected about the possibility of dropping, law school students are now spending their private education expenses in addition to tuition, depending on all kinds of private education. As students are becoming more cost-burdened, more and more students say, "" If you don't have money, you can't go to law school. "" The combined rate of successful changes in 2012 was 87.3 percent, but it dropped to 51.4 percent in the sixth round last year. Starting this year, the combined success rate is expected to be less than 50 percent. In fact, the residents of Gyeongsi-dong are filling in for the empty spaces of Sillim-dong public school, where students preparing for the bar exam disappeared. Goshimchon has now turned into a JeongsI Village. In the past, famous law schools such as H Law School and P Law School in the town were crowded with law school students preparing for the change when they took vacation. In particular, the Spartan style curriculum for students who have been absent from college or in three cities has been noted : 70 minutes, 15 minutes of study time, and non-requisite ' No Smart Phones ' study. Cho, 29, who was absent last winter after dropping out of class this winter, said, "" If I spend eight million won a year on tuition at a law school, my parents will have to pay a lot of money to pay tuition. ""As tuition continues to rise but scholarships are falling and private tutoring costs are rising, the controversy over the "" gold spoon "" in the new book, "" Only rich children can go to school.

"Whether to look into the missile base or not, Vaughan launched the lowest orbiting satellite in the world. If the satellite is at a lower altitude, you can see the ground better. The Japanese government said, "" It is for preparing for disasters, "" but experts analyzed, "" We can use it enough to scout North Korea's missile bases. ""JALGS launched the Earth observation satellite Tsubame at the Tanegashima Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture at 10:26 a.m. on July 23, launching its own satellite, Tsubame, aboard an H2A rocket.Tsubame, which means swallow in Japanese, was developed to test the technologies of a very sub-orbital satellite. Although Earth observation satellites, such as the multipurpose satellite Arirang, usually orbit the Earth at an altitude of 600 to 800 kilometers, Tsubame orbits 180 to 268 kilometers, which is much lower than this. Up until now, the European Space Agency (ESA) had a solid (GOCE) satellite orbit at an altitude of 242km from 2012 to 2013, a very low level. Tsubame will first go into orbit 480 kilometers before lowering the altitude to 180 kilometers over the next two years.Very low altitude satellites allow more precise observation of the earth's surface. European solid satellites were able to detect sound waves from earthquakes. However, when it gets very low, it is also at high risk of falling. As you approach the surface of the earth, the air density increases. As a result, ultra-high-venture satellites receive 1000 times more air resistance than ordinary satellites. It is more likely that it will lose its speed and crash.Japanese scientists have overcome the shortcomings of ultra-high- altitude satellites with new engines. Tsubame's ion engine uses xenon gas as its fuel. Xenon hits electrons emitted from the electrodes and releases its own electron. Then xenon produces an electricity (+). If the reverse electricity is applied from the engine injection port, xenon accelerates to the speed of 100,000 km/h. Satellites move forward with this force. The electricity needed to accelerate xenon is created by solar panels.Ion engines are 10 times more efficient than traditional satellite engines that use liquid or solid fuels. As a result, you can use less fuel. It was thanks to the ion engines that the Japanese asteroid, Hayabusa, made seven long years of flight when it returned to Earth in 2010.The Japanese government said it would use Tsubame to investigate disaster areas and measure oxygen levels. However, Japanese media reported that it could also be used for military and security purposes. Tsubame said North Korea can efficiently scout missile bases.Lee Young-wan, a science reporter at Dongsan.com. According to Busan Police Agency on July 4, a courier reported to police that at 8:30 p.m. last month, he was found dead bleeding from a flower bed on the first floor of an apartment in Busan.Police also found her two children, a four-four-year-old man and a 2-year-old woman, lying down on the flower bed opposite the apartment.

Could it lead to any more dialogue? Is there any other kind of U.S. hard-liner pressure on this? Park Geun-hye in Japan and the government separated them, What Now, it was announced that many Japanese military sexual slavery, shortcomings, our tf. Is the relationship with China completely over again? And that's where we have all the challenges : the Foreign Office. There's a lot to do. Today's news show invited Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa. It's your first radio appearance. Let's meet in person. I connect you with Kang Kyung-hwa. Hello Minister Kang. How are you? Nice to meet you. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Nice to meet you. You have a good voice and you speak very well. Didn't you ever do a radio interview? This is the first time for me to listen to radio. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Then, the first interview news show. Thank you. First of all, I wish you a Happy New Year. Thank you very much, even from the anchor. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Ah, thank you. What are your personal wishes? ◆ Kang Kyung-hwa > How I have fulfilled my personal wish already She said she would get married by the end of the year. I do with my boyfriend that I have been seeing for a long time, not until this year. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > You took a big homework. D. Kang Kyung-hwa > Yes ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Congratulations. Now, what a great country it will be. I have a big wish. D. Kang Kyung-hwa > Yes ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Looking back on last year, no department was busier than the Foreign Ministry. If you were to grade, how many points would you give me out of 100? There was a risk of Kang Kyung-hwa > Jeom-su. I got beaten once. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > did you? Then, hold? Hold the score? Once the new government took over, we restored the summit completely. It has also begun its normal orbit of managing relations with the four powers, and aggressively, in diversifying its diplomacy into North and South Korea. So, there are many things that have been achieved, but there are many things that I want to do. Most regrettable is that the year has passed without finding a clue as to how to solve the North Korean nuclear issue. That's why we would welcome the news that North Korea is about to visit Pyeongchang this year. Through North Korea's participation, Pyeongchang will become more and more peaceful. And, as such good contacts between the two Koreas take place through Pyeongchang, there is an area that can provide a better momentum to the North and South. So we're busy thinking of all the possibilities. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Speaking of North Korea, let's start with North Korea, North Korea, New Year's message from Kim Jong-un. How was the minister? Did you make any predictions, you think it'll come out? Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa (photo = Hwang Jin-hwan reporterdata photo) … Kang Kyung-hwa (photo) > I used to do that all the time, but wasn't it provocative last year in North Korea? We have always expected that we would be ready for the provocation and that it would give us an opportunity to move on to dialogue. So, this is not surprising at all. However, we certainly welcome Pyeongchang's continuous message, which we have sent to the North and South, and then received a positive response from the South and North. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > How on earth did you get this surprise message? I'm kind of stunned by it from the public's point of view. How long has Pyeongchang been mixed up from the bottom up? To the north. North Korea is also a member of the International Olympic family. So not only the Olympics, but also the Paralympics. So, all the NOCs around the world were a festival of peace, and the IOC and the IPC were there to encourage North Korea to participate. So, I think it was a clear message that North Korea considered this time and decided to come. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I see. And Governor Choi Moon-soon, the governor of China who visited in December and had a secret contact with North Korean sports officials, appeared a few days ago. She said, "" As far as I can feel it, I have a perfect chance of being involved. "" Do you agree or disagree? You are right. Actually, I think the Unification Ministry's publicly proposed meeting has responded. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > ` I will open a permanent channel `. Considering that you are saying ` I guess you are right, I am sure that Minister Kang will come 100 %, and who will come to what extent? ` This is very important, and of course the athletes will come. The team will come. Do you think it's possible that the arts troupe could come, too? ^ Kang Kyung-hwa > Yes, I should start consultations. As the Unification Ministry announced, we should start talking about the North's desired dialogue in a timely manner, in an open manner, or in relation to the Pyeongchang Olympics, about reunions of separated families, etc., and then move forward. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > No, do you think he can lead to dialogue with separated families, economic cooperation issues, and even North Korea's nuclear program? First of all, we are discussing North Korea's participation in the Olympics ... ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Yes, but the beginning of course, and this nuclear issue is not unique to the two Koreas. Since this is the most important security issue in the international community, it is not a problem to be solved by the exclusive channels of North and South Korea. So, although this is where dialogue can take place not only with the United States but also with the international community, we can certainly stop further provocations over the North Korean nuclear issue and engage in denuclearization talks. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > I don't think this is going to solve the nuclear problem. But at least what was opened this time is the possibility that what was opened in the passage would not just close after the Olympics but also lead to dialogue about economic cooperation and the resolution of the nuclear issue. I'd like to see some possibility. Wouldn't it be a problem that we can only do based on the case, if we opened it all up? ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. D. Kang Kyung-Hwa > Therefore, Korea-U.S. cooperation is especially important. So, in every aspect of the problem, I'm working with the United States on a lot of close consultations on different levels. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > That's what I was going to ask you. We were in full possession of the honor after Kim Jong-un's New Year's message. It's what we wanted. The problem of Pyeongchang's arrival But I think the atmosphere in America is a little vague. The hard-line faction is apparently uncomfortable and the White House is also in North Korea? We will wait and see. My button that works on the desk.? in Trump, president sns haekppeoteun So, I wonder if this is going to work out for America and for the rest of us, how does it feel? Although such reactions may vary depending on the views of the two countries, I can say that the cooperation between the ROK and the U.S. is very close and firm on the North Korean nuclear issue and the security issue on the Korean Peninsula. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > (North Korea) will participate in Pyeongchang as we do now. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > We are definitely going to be together and then go on to reunions of separated families, talk about economic cooperation, and so on, are we ok with America on this? I think the United States fully understands the issue of separated families. As for economic cooperation, isn't it the North Korea's missile problem that has put it in a very strict framework? These discussions need to be held forward, not just because they are sanctions by the Security Council, but because they can be unilateral ones by the United States. If that's the kind of agenda that we're talking about. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. We should know that Kim Jong Un is getting involved in a strategy to shake cooperation between Seoul and Beijing. There were also criticisms, critical views and concerns. What do you think of this? There may be various analyses on the purpose of the river hardening >. We also have a lot of analysis on our own. At the government level The Foreign Ministry analyzes the matter and is gathering a variety of opinions, but the foreign ministry and the defense ministry are welcoming such messages from external messages, or from messages we have suggested, to come to Pyeongchang. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > that is not to say, stop. Pyeongchang must have been first proposed by us. Take it as it is. That sounds like it. I'm meeting Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa. Park Geun-hye of the government about Japanese Japanese military sexual slavery problem I'll ask for a moment, Minister.
