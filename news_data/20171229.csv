Among the bullet train stations, 3930 households in Daejang-dong, Songpa-gu, are regarded as a major resident. Recently, 82 ㎡ of land for exclusive use was traded for 1.86 billion won. Kim (43), a member of the complex union, was surprised when he took the elevator on July 22. It is because I saw a notice posted at a place called "" Jama Housing Price Maintenance Center. "" As of July 28, all such handouts were lost. [Kim Ki-hwan] quoted as saying, Currently, apartments in Gangnam raise their house prices by 100 million won per week through price fixing. Our complex decided not to sell our house below a certain price, the statement said. Specifically, the guidelines include more than 2 billion won for 36-pyong apartments, 1.9 billion won for 35-pyeong and more than 34 pyeong and 1.9 billion won for larger. Who would love to see their house prices drop, but I don`t know if they could fix things, Kim said. We don`t know whether some members of the union added it, but the union has not been involved, said an official at Jamsil Apts. Collating of house prices by the apartment dwellers has resurfaced. It is like sending out notices to residents ' residencies or women's associations not to sell apartments to residents ' cafes in the area at a certain price. Some agencies even put pressure on their authorized nearby businesses to deal at low prices. We don`t have to pay too much. Some residents even threaten to threaten, ' Be prepared if you don`t raise it. ' It is unusual for Jamsil Apts. Collusion usually happens in areas that are excluded from the upward trend in house prices. In October, an elevator at an apartment complex in Dangsan-dong, Yeongdeungpo-gu was posted as the chairman of the residents ` council. The council even called for a price fixing by discussing nearby apartments. The apartments in Dangsan-dong A are 880 million won and the apartments in Dangsan-dong B are 700 million won, but our apartments are 578 million won. You should never throw your weight off your precious property. Never give a sale to a real estate office that is underselling it. "" In September, there was also a move to rig housing prices in an apartment complex in Wirye. We should not lower the value of apartments by ourselves, said the chairman of the residents ` council, which is to be quoted as saying by the residents. The apartment was sold for 800 million won, up 84 ㎡ from 450 million won at the time of public sale. However, the price is still lower than other apartments nearby. Park (56), a resident, said, As of last year, people began to feel that housing prices were undervalued. We should not blame it on being properly priced as a collusion. There was also an attempt to collude house prices in the mid-2000s. Roh Moo-hyun government is disclosing a succession of High Strength of real-estate measures to inflate the price skyrocketed when house prices, despite collusion by many. At the time, the Ministry of Construction and Transportation (present Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport) and the Fair Trade Commission launched a joint crackdown and, if apartment prices are confirmed, they even blocked real estate information providers from posting apartment prices for one month. However, they could not punish such acts in collusion at the time. The same is true now. We have no reason to punish the residents ` representatives ` meetings or the women's union because they are businesses that are responsible for the collusion under the fair trade law, said a commission official. It is even difficult to specify the damage that we have to deal with due to collusion. Whether apartment price fixing can work is uncertain, however. Unlike in the past, the market price of apartments is open to the public, and social networking services (SNS) have developed to share price information. KB Kookmin Bank, WM Star Advisory Board real estate representative Park Won-gab, said, We can artificially boost prices in the short run. But since we can`t resist the flow of supply and demand in the long run, the collusion won`t last long, predicted the commission. We will monitor the movement for the time being because it is a local phenomenon, a ministry official said. But we will take immediate action if any signs of spreading are seen. But what is caused by misunderstanding "" … "" plans to replace the battery for $ 29 and update the battery condition of the power-related IOS, which is currently subject to a collective action suit filed by Apple Law firm HannurI, have surpassed [1000]. It also said it will provide part of the cost of replacing the battery for users after the iPhone 6. Apple said on its U.S. official Web site on July 28 (local time) that it "" disappointed the users "" and "" I apologize. "" "" We never intended to shorten the life of the product, "" he said. "" Our goal is to make sure that our customers are always ready to love our iPhones.

The cost of replacing the existing battery is $ 79. Early next year, it will update iOS with new features to help users check the condition of the iPhone battery more closely. Suspicions that Apple intentionally restricted the performance of older iPhones were first raised on July 9 on its social news website Redit. Seegebench founder John Pool then conducted a test and concluded that "" It is better to replace the battery than the iPhone when the iPhone is slow. "" As many iPhone users complained of the same complaint, Apple released a public statement on July 20 saying, "" Lithium-ion batteries on the iPhone have low levels of charge, and the software supply fails to comply with the expectation. "" However, the United States and Israel have seen a wave of lawsuits against Apple for its deception. Apple's decision was meant to elicit the purchase of a new iPhone, the company said.

HannurI's lawyer, Cho Kye-chang, claims Apple violated the Consumer Default Act for reducing the performance of its older iPhones without notice.

"Asked by reporters who insisted, "" My daughter Todok is dead and dead, "" they answered, "" I will answer you without a sound. "" (Jun Jeong-ho : Cho Chung-doo, a reporter at the United News Agency, and Ko Jun-hee (5th), who went missing from the police station, told me on Monday. It has been revealed that Ko Joon-hee (5), who went missing in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, was dismissed by her biological father and her mother eight months ago. Police in North Jeolla Province announced at 8 p.m. yesterday that they abandoned the late Jun-hee in Gunsan. Police searched the hill that Ko stated to have abandoned and found Jun-hee, who died after only seven hours of wrapping a towel. No special wounds were seen on the body at the time. It was April 27, more than eight months ago when Ko confessed to dumping Jun-hee. She confessed to the crime when police asked her what she had done between April 26 and 27, which she suspected of being an insider's mother. Putting together these statements, Ko asked Kim to see a doctor on April 26 and referred her to Jun-hee. However, when she arrived at the studio in Inhu-dong, Deokjin-gu, Jeonju, her mouth was spilt with vomit. Police estimated that Jun-hee died at 11:00 p.m. on the same day due to a blocked prayer in food. If Jun-hee dies, I will have to pay my birth mother to get divorced and pay her child support, Koh said. Police are in the process of urgently arresting and investigating Ko and Kim. We need further investigation as we don`t know exactly how to do so yet, a police official said, adding, We will open the door to the possibility that we have colluded with an insider. The investigation began when Ko (35), an insider, reported to police on July 8 that her baby disappeared when she returned home from work. Police used 3,000 people, dogs, and helicopters to search the one-kilometer radius of the room where Jun-hee disappeared, and conducted an investigation against a suspicious family. Koh and Yi, Lee's mother, 61, who were in charge of raising the young woman, were pressured into Kim, but had a difficult time investigating due to her uncooperative attitudes. Eventually, the full story was revealed earlier this year when Koh confessed to the crime after the police grilled him about the fact that Ko and Kim went to Gunsan together. doo@yna.co.kr Police found Goyang's body after an overnight search in a hill in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province.

However, Jun-hee, who was sleeping after eating dinner, was found dead early the next morning because of a touristy prayer. Ko, who returned home, immediately decided to move her body with Kim to the ground as she felt the death of her daughter could be disadvantageous to an ongoing divorce suit with her biological mother. She loaded the dead sheep with tea, moved it to a hill in Naecho-dong, Gunsan, where she dug up the ground by 30cm and buried the body in a cloth. She also has a doll that she loved all her life.

However, he was very cautious as to whether he murdered his daughter in person or if Lee was involved in the crime. Police found the remains of Jun-hee, a bundle of clothes, on a hill in Naecho-dong, Gunsan, as Ko said on July 29, and asked the National Institute of Scientific Investigation for an autopsy. The results of an autopsy are expected to reveal why Jun-hee died. Although it is difficult to determine the exact cause of the death at this time, it is hard to say whether Ko and Kim are involved, Kim Young-keun, head of the prosecutor`s investigation team, said, It is possible that they are organic and abusive. jaya@yna.co.kr"

"○ Winter Olympics : Pyeongchang's Shadows of the Korean Olympic Games : Efficient Private Finance Research Center : The Curse of the Olympics to Be Repressed after 2011 As if to take pleasure in winning the Olympic Games at the end of the three months, the government and construction workers who led the bidding for the Games were busy sailing an Advalun. The rosy outlook was also used to dismiss civic voices calling for an hosting of a grand event to minimize astronomical costs and damage to the environment. However, few are saying ' 64 trillion won ' now as the competition approaches. Is the economic effect of the Pyeongchang Olympics just a mirage? Pyeongchang, which has sacrificed its precious natural heritage of Mount Gariwang, should never end up as a mirage.Among the previous Winter Olympics, the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics in Norway was the only one that received financial recognition. The opening ceremony of the Lillehammer Winter Olympics - Union News Few contests to compete in the remaining Winter Games. The Lillehammer Winter Olympics held in Norway in 1994 is considered to be the only one of its kind. At that time, the organizing committee refrained from constructing stadiums and other facilities as temporary structures, and it reduced the post-management expenses drastically by removing them right after the event. The ski resort where Nordic skiing and Alpine skiing were held was equipped with a hiking and trekking course in the summer, and the Hockons Hall, where the ice hockey finals were held, was equipped with effective measures such as transforming to handball, indoor soccer stadiums and concert halls. The successful hosting of the Winter Olympics has helped the small town of Lillehammer, which attracts 350,000 tourists a year, becoming a tourist attraction in Northern Europe, with an annual income of 185 billion won.Would Pyeongchang, which spends 13 trillion won (13 billion U.S. dollars) per year, be like Lillehammer? Now, with about 50 days to go before the event, the signs are not very good. Most of all, the main concern is how to utilize the facilities built near Pyeongchang. Since the Olympics are held on a city-by-city basis, many facilities are concentrated in one city. After the event, it is up to the local area to find ways to utilize the facility. Failure to use the facility will result in higher administrative costs, leaving local governments in financial difficulties. As a result, people's lives could get worse after the Olympics. After the lavish parties, they fall into the "" Curse of the Olympics "" that bears huge debts. The 88 Olympic Games, held 30 years ago, was held in a big city called Seoul, which made good use of its facilities and infrastructure. Despite the various problems with the political background and preparation process of the event, it has helped raise the standard of living for Seoulites. Pyeongchang, however, is only a small town with a population of 50,000 and neighboring Gangneung has a population of only 210,000. It is incomparably worse than Seoul in terms of population and economy. The budget for Pyeongchang County, Gangwon Province, reached 13.6 trillion won. Among them, 880 billion won was spent to build stadiums and 11 trillion won to build infrastructure and supplementary facilities such as high-speed railways. Most of the facilities were concentrated in Pyeongchang and Gangneung. However, they are hard to create the demands that can support the Olympic infrastructure. It is highly possible that the Olympic infrastructure will lead to the "" curse of the Olympics, "" leaving huge operating costs for the community.That is why civic groups in Gangwon Province conducted a petition to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in February 2015 to divide the Pyeongchang Games. Civic groups petitioned for a distributed plan to reduce the cost of the Games as the IOC passed a reform package that would allow the city to host the Games in late 2014 to reduce the burden of hosting it. At that time, < Hankyoreh > commissioned two domestic architectural planners to simulate a distributed hosting (see March 9, 2015 article on the front page), and found that the existing ice hockey stadiums and alpine ski resorts in Jeonbuk were to be used by 365.8 billion won. Recycling the ice rink and the Muju ski resort facility in Mok-dong, Seoul reduced the costs of constructing stadiums, and reduced the overall costs of running the facilities after the event. Park Chan-ho (right), who played in the Major League of America (Major League Baseball), is known to have maintained his facilities 20 billion won ($ 20 million) per year, carries the torch with him at the Pyeongchang Olympic torch relay in Daejeon on December 9, 2017. While Hanhwa Corp. is expected to pay a large amount of money for the event, it is estimated that the cost of holding the event alone in Gangwon Province would remain high even after the event. Based on the KDI's report on feasibility, the cost of maintaining Pyeongchang's Olympic facility was over 20 billion won per year. The cost of maintaining the Pyeongchang sliding center is 3.1 billion won per year, and that of the men's ice hockey stadiums is 2.9 billion won. As a result, the deficit in management of the facilities in Gangwon Province was estimated at 16.5 billion won per year. However, PyeongChang, Park Geun-hye, the government alone was sticking to hold guns. Civic groups ' petition for a distributed hosting ends up being a "" happening "" campaign. The problem is that the nation has not been properly set up to escape the seemingly obvious Olympic curse. Aside from creating local demand to utilize the Olympic infrastructure, nothing is set out on how to utilize the stadiums afterwards. We will form a task force to deal with post-use issues concerning Pyeongchang facilities by the end of December, Culture, Sports and Tourism Minister Do Jong-hwan said in a recent parliamentary briefing.Currently, three of the seven new stadiums, Pyeongchang Sliding Center, Gangneung Hockey Center and the speed skating stadium Gangneung Oval, are not confirmed. The basic idea is to make the Olympic Plaza, which costs 116.3 billion won, into a memorial park by using it only for the Olympic Games and the Special Olympics (Paralympics) and closing down. However, specific design proposals have not yet been finalized. Four areas that have been decided to utilize them afterwards are also under debate over who should run them. After the event, the authority to operate the stadium will be transferred from the organizing committee to the local governments. However, the Gangwon Province is opposed. That is because the cost to pay is excessive. According to recent administrative audit data submitted to the provincial council by Gangwon Province, an estimated 101 billion won in annual operating balance was accounted for by seven of the total 13 stadiums, including secondary stadiums. The deficit at the Jungseong Alpine Ski Stadium was the biggest at 368.6 billion won, the speed skating rink at 2.2 billion won, and the Gangneung Hockey Center at 2.43 billion won. The estimated deficit for the three facilities operated by the Gangwon Development Corporation for Ski Jumping, Biathlon and Cross-Country was 1.43 billion won, and for the Alpensia Sliding Center was 949 million won. The cost can not be borne solely by the financial status of Gangwon Province. As of 2018, provincial governments had a financial independence rate of 21.3 percent, far below the national average of 47.1 percent. In particular, the financial independence levels of the city of Gangneung, Pyeongchang-gun, and Jeongseon-gun are poor at 18.7 percent, 11.8 percent, and 25.5 percent, respectively. As a result, Gangwon-do is required to provide national management of four facilities besides the three stadiums that have no fixed post-use plans, such as the speed skating, the Gangneung Hockey Center, the sliding center and ski jumping. The government and local governments are trying to pass the bill on to them, but it is questionable whether the request from Gangwon Province will be granted due to opposition from the Ministry of Culture and Technology. Minister Doh Jong-hwan appears at the National Assembly on September 22, 2017 and stated, "" The revision of the National Sports Promotion Act to establish the basis for national management of Pyeongchang's Olympic facilities has its own difficulties. "" The government and local governments are "" handing over "" Olympic facilities that were built with billions of won in funds to each other. The dispute over who should take control of the stadiums after their deaths should be settled as soon as possible. This will ensure time for the preparation of the "" content "" - the proper follow-up measures. Without content that can keep the Olympic fever alive after the event, tourists can not come. Without tourists visiting the facilities, the high-cost facilities could end up as a nuisance, costing taxpayers ' money. Another concern is the sluggish ticket sales that will determine the success of the Games. Among the total sales goal of 107 million copies, 390,000 copies were sold as of November 16, 2017, failing to exceed 40 percent of the total. 10,000 copies of the Paralympics, or 4.3 percent of the 220,000 tickets, were sold. This shows that the interest in Pyeongchang's winter Olympics is not that great both at home and abroad. Corporate sponsorship has served its target only recently. The organizing committee said that corporate donations exceeded the target of 940 billion won as of Dec. 18, 2017. This contrasts sharply with Japan's bid for the Olympics in Tokyo in 2020. The target for corporate sponsorship by the organizing committee of the Tokyo Olympics is 1.4 trillion won, but it has already raised nearly 3 times, or 4 trillion won. That is why Japanese companies positively evaluate the effectiveness of advertising in the Tokyo Olympics. Corporate sponsorship is important, accounting for one-third (33.6 percent) of the Pyeongchang Olympics ' total budget of 2.8 trillion won. If companies actively use the Olympics for marketing, it will help create a festive mood surrounding the Games. There are 49 sponsors of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. There are various industries, ranging from large conglomerates such as Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Kia Motors, LG and SK, to Daedong Industries, a tractor maker, to the Pyeongchang Yeongseong Chukcheong Association, which provides hanu during the Games. Samsung plans to sponsor the Games totaling 100 billion won. It will provide 80 billion won in cash and 20 billion won in spot items, including printers needed to operate the event. Samsung Electronics is the only Korean company to have an Olympic partner. Other sponsors are only allowed to conduct Olympic marketing at home, but Samsung can promote the world on stage. During the 2016 Rio Olympic Games in Brazil, all of the participating athletes were given about 12,500 Galaxy phones. It is known that the event will also sponsor various mobile devices. Hyundai Motor, LG and SK are known to sponsor a combined 25-50 billion won. Hyundai Motor offers a variety of vehicles to be used during the Games. LG supports the entire marketing process, including the production of official promotional videos and outdoor advertising material, until the end of the tournament."
"SK provides the essential oil refining needed to run a competition. Companies are also providing official sponsors for the national team, such as training and various equipment support. The money for the event was adjusted, but the organizing committee expects that the funds for the event will be balanced with the last round of sponsorship activities by companies.

According to the related industries, E-Mart completed the selling process of five Chinese stores to the CP Group in Thailand on July 29. The reason is that China has approved the sale. We have just received authorization from the Chinese government for the sale, said an official at E-Mart, ending the sale process between the groups. As the other store is its own store, you can withdraw the store at any time, so you can say that the closing of the Chinese store is actually complete. E-Mart earlier signed a deal to sell five of its stores in Shanghai to the CP Group in Thailand. However, it is expected to take some time due to the complicated procedures of licensing by the Chinese government. Shinsegae Vice Chairman Chung Yong-jin said at the opening ceremony in May that we will completely evacuate E-Mart from China. As a result, E-Mart, which opened its first store in Shanghai in 1997, has withdrawn completely after 20 years. E-Mart, which has had up to 26 outlets since its entry into the Chinese market, has been undergoing restructuring since 2011 as sluggish performance led to a cumulative deficit. csy625@newsis.com>"

Although it is Sunday the 31st, the branch manager sent out a notice saying, We intend to have a place to end the year, and that all employees should gather at a nearby restaurant by 7:00 p.m. It is like the closing ceremony of a branch office here is held on this day. I don`t know why I have to come out when I don`t have any work to do, Kim said on July 28, It is unfair to have a holiday weekend like this. As such, the practice of bullying office workers is rare. The old style of office work that was once considered obsolete is disappearing. In order to attend the one-hour event, bad habits of going to work or delaying one's vacation have disappeared. As the opening ceremony and the contents of the new year's wedding overlap a few days later and many say it is just a "" empty formalities "", the trend to eliminate or simplify the closing ceremony has spread.

The tax authorities manage them by classifying them as ' persons with no settled tax. ' Are all the ' selfish taxpayers ' who say we should reduce the number of taxpayers who have never really paid a penny in taxes?According to the National Tax Service (NTS) on July 29, among 1,193 taxpayers who earned more than 100 million won in total wage last year, 91.7 percent of those who earned income tax reduction received overseas. They are mostly resident workers who are sent to foreign offices of Korean companies and are classified as tax payers who must be deducted from their tax payments to foreign governments. They are getting tax deductions by submitting documents to the withholding agent to prove tax payment to the foreign government during the year-end settlement in Korea. Most of them are normal taxpayers unless they fake the materials or fabricate the contents. The other 119 people who did not receive tax deductions from abroad received tax deductions from medical expenses and donations. As the government changed its donation and medical expenses from income tax deductions to tax deductions in 2014, the number of taxpayers under the middle class has been on the rise, but the number of high-income people has not decreased. Tax deductions have been relatively reduced since some of the income tax deductions were converted to taxpayers ` money, a government official said, adding, The tax deductions for the low-income bracket also remain intact for children. The government analyzed that many taxpayers who have received taxes other than taxes from abroad make as much donations or spend as they have on medical care. However, some point out that the overall tax exemption system needs to be reviewed, as cases of abusing the system are often found. Some argue that the tax rate should be cut to 43 percent according to the principle of the principle of raising the national tax, but there are also growing concerns that the working class could face a higher tax burden. The proposed reduction in the wage earners ratio is also expected to be discussed as a mid - to long-term agenda of the Special Committee on Taxation and Finance Reform under the Presidential Policy Planning Committee. rock@yna.co.kr and operator's tip and inquiry.

"Jeong Gyeong-jae (Jun-hye, a reporter at the Yonhap news agency Jeong Gyeong-jae), was questioned about requesting an arrest warrant for his aunt and an autopsy, and received her body from her husband. Ko Joon-hee (5), a biological father, and her aunt, a 35-year-old internal mother, reported to police on July 8 that when they returned home, they lost their children. Police used 3,000 people, dogs, and helicopters to search the one-kilometer radius of the room where Jun-hee disappeared, and conducted an investigation against her family. Koh and Yi, Lee's mother, 61, who were in charge of raising the young woman, were pressured into Kim, but had a difficult time investigating due to her uncooperative attitudes. Eventually, the whole episode surfaced earlier this year when the police grilled Koh and Kim about their trip to Gunsan together earlier in the year, admitting that Ko had buried her daughter in the hills. When Miss Jun-hee died on April 26, Ko told police that she buried her daughter in a hill in Gunsan with Kim the following morning. Lee, a single mother of the two, added, "" It is not related to the incident. "" We believe that the abandonment of the bodies of the late Miss Jun-hee could be fatal, said Kim Young-keun, head of the Jeonju Deokjin Police Station, who is in charge of the case.The following is an interview with Director Kim -- Was Miss Jun-hee's body dressed? ▲ It was piled with clothes and there was a doll Jun-hee used to play with. -- store?

There is also a Homo gosiostrope who is fiercely prepared to take the exam, a homophore, and a homo-spectacus who is constantly preoccupied with setting up standards amid job insecurity.Interns, irregular workers, and party-timers who repeatedly do not deal with work are self-motivated new words, referring mostly to the dire situation of job insecurity.◇ Keyword…North Korea Youth Unemployment, Samsung Loan Stop, and Blind Recruitment This year's job market has frozen to a crisp. According to a survey of 763 job seekers and job seekers conducted by job seekers, the average number of job seekers was 38 this year, but the average number of applicants who passed the job applications was three.The group`s new recruitment drive came last in the first half as Samsung, which led the trend of hiring larger companies, including the introduction of the private loan system, college student internships at universities, disabled people and high school graduates, disbanded its future strategy office. In May, the launch of converting non-regular employees to regular government's Moon Jae-in, 16.4 percent, increase the minimum wage jobs in 2018 policy is the biggest issue for both business and job seekers this year.The keywords in the job market in the second half were ' blind recruitment. ' Most of them were adopted by state-owned enterprises and public organizations, and large businesses, small and mid-sized companies, including small businesses, have also increased their hiring patterns based on job abilities rather than specifications.◇ The cold job market in 2018 also suggested that 320,000 people will get jobs next year, similar to this year's, in the direction of economic policies. However, the outlook for the job market by Korean state-run and private research institutes is much darker.The Korea Labor Institute predicted that the number of new workers will grow by 296,000 in its assessment of the labor market in 2017 and forecast of employment in 2018. The figure is 28,000 more than this year's projected estimate of 324,000 and far below the government's. The youth recruitment market is also expected to face difficulties. The outlook for better recruitment of young people shows no sign of improvement and therefore the employment rate remains at a standstill, said the state-run Korea Labor Institute, which has maintained the structural factors and would still not feel good about it.The minimum wage increase is positive for job quality and income improvement, but it could negatively affect employment, it added.The KDI predicted a rise in the number of employed people to around 300,000, and the unemployment rate would be 3.7 percent, similar to this year's (3.8 percent). Private research institutes have darker prospects.LG Economic Research Institute predicted that the number of employed people will grow to just 270,000 next year. As the increase in employment is centered around women and the retired age group, the problem of youth unemployment is unlikely to be eased next year, the institute predicted.Hyundai Economic Research Institute said, There is a possibility that the economic growth rate in 2018 will slow slightly compared to this year, limiting the improvement in the job market, especially as the jobless rate rose due to the falling pressure on construction workers due to sluggish construction.◇ Eight out of 10 college seniors can not afford to work next year, '' adding, "" The outlook for next year`s job market in the field such as college seniors and businesses is not much different. When asked to hire 199 corporate HR officials for the first half of next year, 59.3 percent answered they would hire them as "" similar to the previous year, "" while 22.1 percent answered they would reduce them. Human resource directors cited "" minimum wage disputes leading to a reduction in employment (39.2 percent, multiple responses) "" as the biggest issue in the recruitment market next year. The report also showed that 34.7 percent of employers hired more hard workers, 20.6 percent more employers, 19.6 percent more frequent employers, and 18.6 percent more blinds.Albamon, a part-time portal, conducted a survey of 781 job seekers and found that more than half of the respondents in the job market next year, or 54.2 percent, answered that they would be "" similar to this year.

Whether the two sides should leave the party is another controversial issue, but they should first make a gentleman agreement to keep their respective shares, including proportional representation, as part of their expulsion form. The right party might find it difficult to share the same room with members of the Honam region, and therefore Ahn might accept the demand for an agreement.

"[Hari-Wang Special Olympics Special Olympics Special Olympics Winter Games Special Issue : Winter Olympics Children's Park The trees are packed with the same tree team as the Hangyeong-Jeong-eul's Kim Myung-jin. Even the sun can not penetrate the forest easily after midday midsummer. The cattle fly, the bees, the mosquitoes, and countless other nameless bugs run all the time. Anyone can see immediately that it is different from other forests. A place where civilian access has been strictly prohibited. Where there are no trails to climb, people are intruders. It is the starting point of the downhill Stadium in Gariwang Mountain, just before the logging season begins. The three peaks of JubongguI, Jungbong and Habong, commonly referred to as reunions, form the home of hard trees, making the mountain Gariwang. Namsa-myeon of Gariwang Mountain is free to enter, as its natural recreational forest and hiking trails are maintained. Meanwhile, hiking trails that lead to reunions are reserved for mountain climbers. Even if you start off on Jungbong and Habong, you should head for the reunion by turning Janggumok Road to the side of the hiking trail. There is no way for anyone to go up the peak of Mt. Gariwang's northern history by going up to Jungbong and Habong. Until June 2013, the forest's gene pool was completely protected. Gariwang Mountain (1561m above sea level), the ninth highest mountain in South Korea, is also known as Bongsan. Since the reign of King Sejong of the Joseon Dynasty, Mt. Gariwang has been a Bongsan, where citizens are forbidden to enter. Rest for a while is another reason why this place, which is a burden, is called a 500 year protective forest. But as of December 2017, it is no longer a reservation. 100,000 large and small trees were cut down without a trace. And the ski slope is replacing it. The 500-year-old conservation forests ended like that. The tragedy began when the province of Gangwon vowed to host the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. If track and field events are the main events of the Summer Olympics and the marathon is the flower, then the main events in the Winter Games are the snow events, and most of them are downhill events. Skiers speed down to more than 140 kilometers per hour, crossing the ground and in the air. Of all the sports events, it is the fastest speed a human can perform with no movement. For this urgency, the International Ski Federation (FIS) will provide a stadium condition with a difference of altitude of at least 800 m (difference between start and finish), an average slope of at least 17 ° and a slope extension of at least 3 km. It is the standard of the countries whose winter sports originated with mountains higher than 2000 meters and 3,000 meters high. During the latest 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, he played a downhill race at the Rosa Cutorsky Competition Center. Downhill at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics was at 2181 meters above sea level. These are the cities that were chosen to host the Winter Olympics, beating Pyeongchang of Gangwon Province, at the 2003 Czech Republic and Guatemala's International Olympics Committee. Japan's bid for the Winter Games, the only two in Asia at Sapporo and Nagano, is no different. In Nagano, where the 1998 Winter Olympics was held, dozens of ski resorts were built between peaks that were more than 3,000 meters long. Naturally, Sochi, Vancouver and Nagano were all involved in downhill events at traditional ski resorts. By the way, the highest mountain in our country is Korean mountain, Halla Mountain, 1947 m. There are only 15 ski resorts across the country. The downhill race at the Olympics is not challenging in all aspects, natural and cultural conditions. Still, Gangwon Province proposed Gariwang Mountain as the site of the downhill race, with conditions such as all stadiums will be located within 30 minutes of the Pyeongchang Alpensia site. The only benefit of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics is that ' all stadiums are located within 30 minutes of Alpensia ' is in itself a ' disaster. ' Who will handle the new Olympic facilities around Hoenggye-ri, Pyeongchang-gun, where the population is 4,000? Unfortunately, however, the benefit worked. Pyeongchang, ' which cried out in Durban, South Africa in 2011, returned with an arrow to Gariwang Mountain.Environmental group members call for an end to the destruction of Gariwang Mountain in front of Pyeongchang Winter Olympics public relations officer in Asiad Main Stadium in Incheon on September 19, 2014. The site of the downhill Stadium in Mt. Gariwang, as suggested by journalist Kim Bong-kyu in Gangwon Province, is a forest genetic protection zone that has been tightly prohibited from being developed. The forest genetic protection zone defined under the Management of Mountains Act is one of the strongest regulated areas in the protected area. If caught digging in small wild greens, such as dureolI or gomchi, they will face up to seven years in jail or fines of 20 million won. If you get caught illegally entering and leaving the mountain, you will be fined 100,000 won for whatever reason. And it was the ecology and nature zone designated by the Ministry of Environment and was also a grade 1 and 2 region. By principle, no development projects are possible in these areas. So, the current law says that Kariwang Mountain, which is designated as a protected area, can never be built. However, the law did not protect the mountain. It is because some diligent politicians made a special law earlier than usual and defeated the law. The tool they used was the Special Law on Pyeongchang Winter Olympics Support. In June 2012, the Forest Service confirmed Mount Gariwang as the site of the Downhill Stadium at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. That's because it is the land of the Forest Service under the law. The Korea Forest Service said it plans to scrap parts of the area by planning to do so because it is a protected area. It also added a clause that says it will restore the forest and designate it as a protected area after the Olympics. The area to be lifted is 78 square meters, or 110 international soccer stadiums. At that time, the person who announced that the reserve areas would be removed for ski resort construction was the director of Forest Protection Bureau at the Korea Forest Service. How ironic! A year later, some of the protected areas were released as scheduled, and the ball went from the Forest Service to the Environment Ministry. Environmental impact assessment started according to the Act. The way environmental groups fight such preposterous development is actually simple. Check whether due process is followed, whether budget execution is appropriate, whether grounds are properly made, and whether they are false, and whether they are confirmed or not. There are only one in a hundred media outlets for sit-ins and rallies. Most argue right and wrong in law and system. However, the problem of Gariwang Mountain was almost incontestable within the law and the system. As I said earlier, it is because it neutralized existing laws and systems by creating an "" Act Without Special Law. "" Nonetheless, it took more than a year to complete the environmental impact assessment. It is not because we are good at fighting but rather because the business owner, Kangwondo, was too messy. The restoration plan, which was originally promised, was a matter of life and the documents presented by the authorities were unsatisfactory. Meanwhile, illegal logging was carried out and orders were temporarily placed to suspend construction, so there was nothing normal. If it was not for the Special Law, the DH stadium plans must have been overturned in the environmental impact assessment. However, whether it is the design of someone who is omnipotent, the administrative process was completed before it was too late to say "" Chuseok, the Korean Thanksgiving Day. "" And Gariwang Mountain will be filled with the sounds of an electric saw.The inflection point for Choi Soon-sil's shadow on Mount Gariwang grew out of nowhere. On December 8, 2014, the IOC announces the Conference's ' Agenda 2020 '. The decision to host the Olympics as the first and foremost principle was to abandon the principle of hosting the first city. By declaring the principle of holding multiple cities, the government would guarantee a wide distribution of the Olympics. In fact, it is fully anticipated. It has been a long time since advanced European countries such as Switzerland, Austria, and Germany scrambled to declare their winter games abandoned or withdrawn, and the race for the summer Games was not the same. It was a self-help measure presented by the IOC to recognize that Olympic maintenance is no longer sustainable. And the next day, the IOC asked the Korean Olympic Committee to hold a sledging event in Nagano, Japan. Environmental groups thought the IOC proposal was the last time the heavens gave it to Mount Gariwang. Just think of how many things you can imagine when you take the 30 minutes off Alpensia. The dispersive hosting was a golden opportunity to normalize various mistakes that had been forced into place. However, Park Geun-hye “There is no events.” the president was putting a damper in a single word. As such, a one-stage ski resort was built on Gariwang Mountain. , it turned out, after the president was the scarecrow, and Pyeongchang in a number of suspected ‘coordinator’ figure there is a real estate. Gariwangsan Mountain is Korea's most representative windblooded area. Cool winds blow from the ground in summer and warm winds in winter. The windblooded area, where the seeds are kept at a constant temperature throughout the four seasons, is seed bank itself. In addition, the ecological value is higher than anywhere else in the mountain, with windblooded areas scattered around. Gariwang Mountain is the only natural habitat of the attention, ranging from one thousand to one thousand to one thousand. Mt. Seorak also has its own interests, but no more young attention is naturally born on the mainland of South Korea. So, if the ecosystem of Gariwang Mountain, the mountain from young to old, is destroyed, attention in Korea will disappear. So far, the Gangwon Province has repeatedly said that it will disregard its initial promise and post utilize the downhill sections of Gariwang Mountain. However, the downhill track at the Olympics is by no means a ski resort for the public. Ordinary people have to risk their lives to ride. And the nation's ski resort business is not booming anymore. It has only been a few days since the Taebaek Otu Resort was reopened with difficulty after going bankrupt. Fortunately, a ' Kariwang Mountain Ecological Restoration Team ' composed of Gangwon-do, central ministries and experts recently decided to close the gondola and restore the entire area of the slope. Of course, it is more of a concern. It is the Olympics in two months, and neither the Gangwon Province nor the central ministry will discuss the restoration budget. Keep one's eye on the ball as if it were spinning a bomb.The tragic downhill Stadium in PyeongChang will also be a tragedy in Olympic history. It does not fit into the environmental agenda advocated by the IOC at all. It also hurt South Korea's status as a protected area. If anyone wants it, they can easily disable the protected areas, no matter what the law guarantees. It is easy to screw up but difficult to rebuild. Like this little thing"

It has been a week since the company publicly announced that it has intentionally restricted the performance of its older iPhone.Apple announced on its official website on July 28 (local time) that it would replace the batteries of the iPhone 6 and other older models for $ 29. Considering that the cost of the replacement used to be $ 79, it actually provides a $ 50 subsidy.In addition, it announced that it would add features to better understand battery condition when updating iOS next year.Apple CEO Tim Cook's climb to close the WWDC 2015 Kinot overcame a controversial "" reduction in old iPhone performance "" that began earlier this month on social news site Reddit.However, there is still a question mark as to whether Apple's latest move will lead to a restoration of confidence. Apple has been hiding the limitation of traditional iPhone performance via iOS for nearly two years because the debate continues.■ Long lasting performance decline … Positive on this move, "" foreign media outlets are saying, "" but positive on Apple's move.It is too early to determine whether Apple's official apology and support for battery replacement are enough to restore confidence, Cinet said.However, some experts added that Apple's quick apology and battery replacement support were positive.Tumblr co-founder Marco Ament told Twitter on the same day, "" Apple has been hit hard by the performance-conscious limitation problem, and the aftermath will last several years. "" However, he added that this is considered a good step to restore trust.Ben Bazarin, creative stratiges analyst at (Photo : Cinet), also posted a tweet, saying, "" Apple seems to have taken its first step in the right direction. ""IT professional media RICOD compared Apple's move to the 2010 "" antenna gate.

"" Ricord said Apple's move is more flexible than ever.■ The problem is collective litigation, as the suits of angry users seem to continue. As Apple intentionally lowered the performance of its older iPhone, a series of lawsuits against Apple have been filed against the U.S. and other countries.In Korea, several law firms are also preparing for class action lawsuits.The class action litigants argue, If Apple had properly informed us that the poor performance was due to batteries, we would not have spent too much money on buying the new model.The litigants say Apple has made unnecessary payments in iOS because it failed to properly report that the battery has reduced the performance of its older iPhone.Therefore, it is not very probable that the class action suit will be postponed despite Apple's decision.Kim Ik-hyeon, a reporter at (sini@zdnet.co.kr) and subscribe to Jidinet Korea from Naver."
"Click here on the Kookmin Daily Web site to view the image as being too late. It also plans to secure stable growth plates and improve the quality of life by supporting export-driven flow with boosting domestic demand. Once that goal is achieved, the Korean economy will be on the same side with advanced countries on the outside. However, there is still a dark cloud that rarely disappears. The most typical example is youth employment. The index of youth jobs has frozen to a greater extent than it did during the IMF and the global financial crisis. Next year's economic blueprint is out.As of November this year, the jobless rate for young people aged 15-29 was 9.2 %. It is the highest since November 1999 when statistics related to it were compiled. Unemployment rate among young people, including job seekers and job seekers, was 21.4 percent. The rate of unemployment was above 20 percent throughout the year. Moon Jae-in immediately after the president took office, Cheong Wa Dae to management board to create jobs in the unemployment rate is not changed. Employment has also decreased. Employment for those aged 19 to 29 was 55.7 % between January and October this year, down by 0.5 % from 56.2 % during the same period last year. The tight door in the job market for college graduates was also the cause, but it was difficult for specialized high schools and junior college graduates to adjust their manufacturing, food, and accommodation businesses. The government also referred to the effectiveness of the civil service examination as a factor in boosting youth unemployment. Unemployment among young people, who were mostly in the 8th grade class, surpassed the 9 percent mark, as a result of hiring local government officials in the second half of the year following the supplementary budget. Moon Jae-in who value ‘priming’ role of government public sector jobs, young people's preference for public servant has engaged the policy directions of future public sector recruitment is under way, every time.There is youth unemployment is likely. Essentially, the warmth of an economic recovery is behind the youth's job market. Due to such unfavorable conditions, the government could not make any prediction on the employment of young people. Young people are concerned about growing difficulty in finding jobs in the first half of next year when jobs are concentrated, the government said in its economic policy direction next year. The situation of the purse is not sufficient for the young man who was delayed due to the economic hardship due to the tight labor market. According to the National Statistical Office's report on household finance and welfare, the average debt of household owners under the age of 30 was 23.85 million won as of March this year, a 41.9 percent increase from 16.81 million won a year ago. Compared to people in their 40s (85.33 million won) or 50s (85.24 million won), the amount of debt is small, but the rate of increase is sharply rising. The ratio of financial debt to savings is also higher than other age groups in terms of growth. It is interpreted that although the amount of money earned by part-time internships or part-time jobs is small, the financial situation of young people is worsening due to housing costs, living expenses, and student loans. The fact that the young people in their 20s and 30s are leading the speculative frenzy over virtual currency is also related to this situation. The application analyst firm Wise App analyzed the top 10 users of virtual currency applications by age group, and found that those in their 30s (32.8 %) and 20s (26.9 %) ranked first. It is far higher than those in their 40s (19.5 percent) and 50s (11.2 percent). A high proportion of those in their 20s who are economically challenged can be interpreted as aiming for a jackpot by using Bitcons, which can be invested at a relatively small amount. Social science professor Im Un-taek at Kyemyung University said on July 28, I felt uneasy about the future because I don`t expect young people to live any better than my parents ` generation, and made a fortune in the coin market. And when it is hard to find a good job and rumors about earning money with Bitcone spread, they are as easily tempted. It is a kind of vicious circle that repeats itself, he added. The Lost Generation? Some point out that the Korean version of the jobless generation has become the most sought after global financial crisis. The reality of the "" Ice Age on Employment "" lasting about 10 years is similar to that of Japan, which experienced a long recession from the 1990s to the mid-2000s. In Japan, the Ice Age appeared as the shortage of jobs for youths worsened due to a prolonged slump, an increase in the young population, and a rigid recruitment system. The current mid-thirties and mid-40s still receive less pay and have a higher percentage of non-regular workers than previous generations. The recent economic boom in Japan and the decline in the young population mean that it is in contrast to college graduates in their 20s who are easily employed. Japan's ice age has long been jobless, so it is easy to bear the loss in terms of wage and welfare even after getting a job. Lee Keun-tae, a senior researcher at LG Economic Research Institute, said, As people are judged to have a poor quality of human capital when they are delayed in their work, they are worried about a decline in wage levels, and the spending in Japan will continue to grow at a low cost. Workers in the Ice Age were found to have paid 90 percent of the wage of the employed immediately after graduation. If the term of the "" unexpired business "" is extended to four years, wages will drop to 62 percent of the employed immediately after graduation. There is a possibility that this is happening in Korea. In particular, with the number of people aged 25-29 expected to grow by more than 110,000 next year, the competition for jobs is likely to grow. Experts say that if the childcare burden entices women with double income and the growing number of elderly people who are not ready for retirement, it could worsen the unemployment risk among young people. When Park Geun-hye whether the government every year after the launch youth jobs measure was announced with the warm breeze. Re-named measures were adopted to provide jobs for young people, employment cliffs for young people, and jobs for young people and women. However, many young people wanted jobs that would give them stable standard of living rather than the quality of jobs. Moon Jae-in, the government will announce a comprehensive plan for youth employment in January. The president over the past 27 National Economic Advisory Council “Economic indicators are improving but not being felt in the lives of individual citizens.” in youth employment situation represented.As. We need to take special measures to hire young people, he stressed. Will the New Year 2018 be able to laugh?Baek Sang-jin : Graphic sharky@kmib.co.kr, [Facebook] [Undiscriminated report : Hook!

Seoul City plans to take the time to examine Eunma carefully, as it is the first time it has been reviewed with such a large scale.According to Seoul City, the government decided to hold off on setting up a repair plan for apartments and reviewing the designation of police at the general meeting of the 24th Urban Planning Board on Monday. We have taken the time to review the large complex and send the amendment to the subcommittee after holding it, a city official said, adding that the meeting should be recomplimented in detail.Members of the committee are known to have suggested a big framework for the reconstruction proposal, including some revisions in the areas of infrastructure, transportation, and police. Based on this, the committee will have to work to coordinate with the committee on reconstruction.A city official said, Some of the opinions proposed by the committee on the committee will take the time to review and post the opinions to the plenary session, should some revisions be made. Although the reconstruction proposal for the Eunma project was announced at a plenary session of the committee last August, it was the first time that it was actually the first time that it has been reviewed properly, and therefore it was widely anticipated that it would be difficult to pass it in a single round. The plan to rebuild the Chinese capital has not been properly reviewed as it stuck to its 49-story tall building plan opposed by the Seoul Metropolitan Government. The city has exceptionally refused to deliberate on the reconstruction proposal for the 49th floor of the Eunma that was submitted in August. In October, the commission decided to abandon the idea of rebuilding the 49th floor and accept it, and the discussions began in earnest. The plan submitted by the commission is to get rid of apartments that are currently worth 4,444 on the 14th floor and to be rebuilt as total 5905 on the 35th floor. As the decision to rebuild the Eunma project was put on hold during the committee's plenary session, the committee is expected to review it next year. The schedule of the review is expected to be determined by how the committee coordinates the work with the committee in the future."

At home, people enjoy talking to each other, challenging each other, challenging each other, and challenging each other's lifestyles, to the point of starting a new life when their children can finally do what they want to do. It is a new word that can erase the nuances of the darker side and weaker side of traditional titles such as silver, elder, old and old. The term "" adult "", which is also given by the mayor to retired seniors of Dankai, is attributed to its lack of respect for the elderly. New Year's Eve 2018 is a good time to try to make an aggressive and vibrant switch to the adult Innobater. It is not just about money, although one should be relatively free economically. Planning a life full of vitality is at the heart of the adult innovator, even within possible limits. To that end, I arranged small tips for adults to Innobater through Japanese reports and reports translated into books. Put it this way : when you have mental and physical strength remaining, not only your belongings but also your relationships with others are all you need to do with the company, KurashI Karu (light living), to improve the residential environment in Japan's middle and old age. "" Take off your suit and start half of your life again "" (Wisdom House), a manual of "" Roh Jeon-jun's End, "" sold more than 100,000 copies in Japan, creating a "" clean-up boom for middle aged people. "" It is literally advice to put not only objects in the transition period of your life after your 40s or 50s but also your mind, heart and relationships together. He said, "" Put away your waste, which you have tied yourself up to before you get older, and make up your future with your free body and mind. "" Sang-goo says, "" When you have energy, strength, and mental strength left, you can see what's important to you by organizing what you don't need. "" Retired Japanese citizens in their 70s say they have an average of 15 suits they wore while on active duty in their wardrobes. Having to keep a relationship with a human requires time, money, emotion, and energy, and requires people to think about what kinds of relationships are needed and what kinds of relationships are needed. In particular, the man who has lived in the company center would like to know who he or she would like to go on a trip, who would like to have a meal or a drink, and who would have a better name if he were admitted to hospital? Only then will he be able to join a new hobby club or go hiking alone. Here are the five rules of Nojeon's theorem. Do not organize all at once. Do not aim for perfection from the beginning. Do not buy the storage item before organizing the items. It is different from using a camera to writing. And one important thing. Never touch the items of the family.Communication should be encouraged and laughed by young people, not the condescending ' The Unfavored Adults '. It defines people in their 50s and 60s as new adults and studies their perceptions and behaviors, while applying the findings to the market and society to make adults a culture engine. They believe adults will create a new consumption culture and create lifestyle to lead the world. The institute picked "" communication with the younger generation "" as its key factor in becoming a great adult or not. This is a similar economic opportunity for Japan's adult generation, and for the younger generation of Korea's youth, to live content with little work, even after they retired, drawing the attention of Japan's growth period. The report showed that adults picked strong men as attractive, whereas the younger generation found warm and soft men attractive, showing a difference. For young people the ' adult ' is the ones who complain, act big and always seem to be angry. On the contrary, a good adult can encourage and develop a junior or junior member, and make him or her laugh and tell a joke. When you're doing social networking services that communicate with the younger generation, you should post short, photo-centered postings rather than long ones without pictures, and you shouldn't necessarily post advice about hobbies or subjective opinions.

"Police Investigation into the Accident Cause of Gangseo -- The possible human resources disaster occurred at the demolition site of the Seoul Gangseo district.Experts point to structural issues such as outsourcing of risks amid repeated crane accidents, paying attention to the possibility that the accident was also a possible human disaster.◇ Pivic…bang, '' a pre-over warning call for a mobile crane accident (photo : reporter Kim Myeong-ji) in Gangseo-gu, Seoul, was quickly overturned with a 5-ton excavator loaded on it. It was installed on a rough, muddy floor, and then out of balance in a pile of bumpy construction waste.In particular, the ' safety iron sheet ', which serves as a balance device installed under supports when the ground is unstable, is still not found and "" has been laid out in four corners of the crane, "" referred to as a ' safety shield, ' when installing cars on the ground.Police are charging crane operators without physical detention on charges of manslaughter and calling in field managers to investigate the exact cause of the accident, raising the alarm at the crane as a foundation of the accident.◇ Why did you work so hard in a small space?If you look at the CCTV, it is very possible that the crane worked too hard without enough work space. Lee Young-cheol, head of the machinery division of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions ` construction labor union, said, If the site is too small, it is likely that it will conduct a mission immediately, but if crane operators refuse, they should be paid as they can not.Experts point out that not only drivers who operated the crane themselves, but also those who have deployed personnel at the sites and provided safety training to officials should be checked. Park Jong-kook, former crane operator, said, "" As a public safety officer, I have to increase my voice to the point of view, and I have to sign up for all my special photographs, "" adding, "" Sometimes I have to get them signed up for two hours. ""The crane was recorded to have been manufactured in 2008, but it is also necessary to check if the documents were fabricated or an outdated part was used. It is known that many of the cranes deployed to construction sites are falsely registering the time of production. Tower Crane, who collapsed in Yong-in, Gyeonggi Province on July 9 and killed three workers, was registered as the "" 2016 "" registration status, but the actual year of manufacture was 2012. We have to look at the actual year and see what happened to the equipment, said Chung Woon of the Federation of Korean Trade Unions ` National Tower Cranes.◇ Security aside … is it because of money again?(Photo : Park Jong-min, journalist) The reason why the small crane company can not usually resist the contractor's unreasonable instruction to work is that it needs to get work done. They say they focus on reducing costs to obtain the lowest bid from the original government and then fail to pay due attention to safety.Park Jong-kook, head of the Korea Mobile Crane Association, said, "" It is worse to call a mobile crane a ' one-man company ' than a tower crane, "" adding, "" The subcontractor intends to make with cheap equipment, whatever it takes. """" The drivers are trying to get things done quickly to cover their rent, not to mention making a fuss about it, but the original office will only have to take care of the burden, "" the government added, guaranteeing that such an accident would stop the unreasonable demands."
"The year 2018 will be a year when IT devices overcame technological limitations to become sophisticated and AI technologies to enter everyday life.It is not long before the ‘ portable ’ phones, dream smartphones that can fold the display itself, will be in the hands of consumers.As the bezel is minimized and the display is filled with smartphone images that are displayed on the screen, it is expected that the development of biometrics sensors between smartphone makers will be intense.Robots that shocked the public by flying in the air this year will soon be able to walk on two feet as skillfully as humans.Next year, all electronic appliances in the house will be infected with AI and voice recognition AI will be extended to wireless earphones and cars.Foldable poldable, rollable rollable cellular phone is expected to become the biggest issue of smartphones in 2018. A poldable phone is a phone that folds and unfolds the itself, including a display. It is totally different from traditional folder phones because the display itself folds up without any extra hinges. Samsung Electronics announced in September that it planned to release the Poldable phones by 2018. LG Electronics, Apple, China Lenovo, and Japan Sony are also preparing Poldable phones.Foldable has a huge ripple effect in the display and battery industries, said Samsung Electronics President Ko Dong-jin, adding, We will release the product after addressing its technological limitations to provide innovation and convenience. Samsung Electronics is currently nicknamed the Galaxy X. The industry predicts that if the Galaxy X is folded down, it can be used for smartphones and tablets and laptops. Experts say Samsung Electronics can beat competitors such as Apple to dominate the market if it issues the Galaxy X concept video / Techconfigurations capture. Market research firm Strattage Analytics forecast that the market size of Poldable Display will grow from 2.7 million units this year to 1890 million units next year and to 636 million units by 2022.Rollable displays that can be rolled up are also receiving attention. LG Display is said to be the first to display a 55-65 inch rollable display for OLED TVs at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January of next year. The rollable display, which is expected to show the peak of the flexible display technology, is made of flexible plastic board utilizing the structural benefits of OLED technology.⑨ In addition, the perception of ‘ Bezel-less ’ design, in which the front of an evolving smartphone is filled with displays, will be applicable to premium products in 2018 and to medium - and low-price productsWhether display integrated fingerprint recognition will be embedded in smartphones is crucial. To maximize the bezel lease design, a fingerprint recognition feature should be built into the display. The industry predicts that the display version of fingerprint recognition will be installed on the Galaxy S9 or the Galaxy Note 9. There were rumors that it would be installed on Galaxy Note 8 and the iPhone X, but neither of the companies could because of the technological limitations. China's BB released its first display-index fingerprint recognition smartphone in June, but its recognition speed and accuracy decreased.The 3D face recognition ecosystem, including the face ID embedded in the iPhone X, is also expected to expand. Face ID is a key feature Apple has shown off its fingerprint identity, called Touch ID, and is an ambitious feature. Use a "" true-depth camera "" with a high-performance camera module and a dot projector to recognize and unlock the user's face shape. Apple explained, "" The security of face ID machines is better than previous fingerprint recognition. "" Apple is expected to add face ID to its new iPad, and Chinese smartphones are speeding up research and development to make 3D face recognition solutions available. Apple Face ID / Apple provided for its robot simulator "" Isaac / Envidia, "" which was released in May by Envidia, allowing for jumps, detailed hand movements and sports, and the evolution of AI technology has been accelerated. From collecting information on an autonomous vehicle or helping with simple labor to learning detailed movements, he or she can make detailed movements that are unique to humans, creating drawings and sports. Major technologies are also expected to be introduced at CES 2018 in New Year's.Envidia launched Isaac at CES 2018, which developed for hockey and golf by connecting dozens and hundreds of robots into collective intelligence to share trial and error. Naver has shown a strong movement from an autonomous running based collection of indoor space information robot and the arm of a human being through its Developer Meeting in October 2017.▲ Boston Dynamics ' aerial jump from Atlas. / The technology unveiling of such robot technology by domestic and foreign IT companies at Boston Dynamics is likely to develop rapidly and the competition is also likely to get fierce. Recently, Boston Dynamics, a soft-banked robotics developer, unveiled a rotating-rotation jump for the human-type walking robot Atlas Shrugged (Atlas), which is also a rapid improvement from previous years.As AI development is rapid, various sociocultural and policy discussions on robots are likely to take place, as is the case with concerns and discussion on AI development. In fact, the company, which is worried about AI, saw a video of robot jumping released by Boston Dynamics and warned that "" we are dead now, "" and "" in the next few years, robots will evolve faster. ""AIAI technology, which percolates into daily life, is rapidly entering people's daily lives. From speakers to home appliances, earphones, and cars, AI technologies are increasingly being applied in various fields.After the U.S. Amazon launched its AI speakers, KT, SK Telecom, Naver and Kakao began to compete in Korea this year. Next year, it is forecast that all of the household appliances in the home will be connected with AI. Major ICT companies are speeding up the construction of smart homes that connect home appliances with Internet technologies via AI. Using a voice-activated AI secretary embedded in AI speakers or smartphones, one can control electronic appliances by voice alone. LG Young-soo Chairman Kwon Young-soo (right) and Naver CEO Han Sung-sook introduce their smart home service ' U + Our Home ' with AI speakers ' Friends Plus ' on December 18, 2017 at their Yongsan office building in Seoul. Wireless earphones with AI transmission technology for the Chosun Ilbo during the week are also expected to be more easily seen around next year. Google recently launched Pixelbirds, a wireless earphone that will translate into real-time language. We put Google's AI translation technique into earphones. Naver is releasing Mars, a wireless earphone company that translates 10 languages, in January of next year. It is a product that combines AI platform clover developed by Naver and its own AI container and translation service, papago.AI technologies are also being introduced in automobiles. China's Baidu is working with automakers Ford and developing an AI powered autonomous driving car, while Hyundai is developing a car with a voice recognition AI secretary.New York's Bronx Apartment [AP = Yonhap News Agency)] was found dead at least on the night of July 28 in New York City.

"A joint committee to normalize the University of southwestern Seoul protest against the order Thursday in front of the Education Ministry at Sejong Center in Seoul. News 1 and South Jeolla University's decision to suspend the enforcement of ` Close Order ` was made last week by news agency Lee Gyu-jin, a reporter at the Education Ministry. The court has decided to decide sometime next week whether to suspend the execution of the ministry`s order to close the classroom, which was requested by the Association of Professors at Kyungnam University. During the hearing on the suspension, which was held on July 29 as part of the first part of the administrative court in Seoul, lawyer Kim Yong-cheol of Seoul National University said, The closing of the education ministry is not just people who will face death sentences, but also people who will face death sentences.As the measure continued, professors and faculty members lost their jobs, and students had to transfer to the schools, and it was evident that "" Even if canceled, they could not recover. "" "" If the ministry's decision is carried out, the property will be returned to the authorities and the founders who embezzled 333 billion won will be exempt from payment, "" the lawyer said.As for the students being involved, the ministry may have left the door open. But right now, medical students and ordinary students don`t agree, although it may be cosmetic, we can`t actually incorporate it. His school is gone. Is it to save the students? I think it is irresponsible.`` It looks like he promised medical students he would guarantee admission by referring to two specific universities, '' the lawyer said. `` On the other hand, the average student does not have such guarantees. ''Meanwhile, an education ministry spokesman said, The measure was aimed at ensuring that students at Kyungnam University did not have to have their right to any further violation of their right to education due to the insolvent schools that are not legally viable."" The reason for the schools is to educate students. The right to education is either to hold the job of a faculty member or to have essential value over the professor`s right to teach, critics say, The analogy of a death sentence is inappropriate.The ministry said, The root cause of this is not being able to operate private schools, adding, Recruiting freshmen without preparation or countermeasures will create another victim. Whether it is in itself a benefit to protect students is questionable whether recruiting students when they can not provide their own education. The university's claim that the founder would avoid paying off arrears on the outstanding loans will be claimed by its creditors. Such an argument is not right.The student body at the medical school who attended as a support participant from the ministry said, I have never received any discriminatory guarantees (for incorporation). Medical schools are running complicated procedures for admission, the prosecution said.We will decide whether to suspend the trial sometime next week, the court said.The Education Ministry said on February 13 that it ordered Seonnam University in Namwon and Asan in North Jeolla Province to close its schools next February. The university has also suspended starting students for the 2018 school year. The institute also ordered the dissolution of Sonam University, a private university with no other schools to operate. Seonnam University has been suffering from the embezzlement of fees by founder Lee Hong-ha. In 2015, he was ranked last in the assessment of restructuring of universities in the Ministry of Education. In addition, the university failed to investigate the three previous demands for reform and closing schools, and also failed to provide an audit on the current account of 333 billion won, including the amount the founder spent on tuition and late payment.The professors ` council of Kyungnam University and the student union of Asan University filed the lawsuit against the ministry's decision to close down the law, asking the Seoul Administrative Court to cancel the order to close the university and dissolve the university's Southwest campus. The student union of Namwon University dropped the lawsuit yesterday.Asd 12 @ bo View the news and photo on PyeongChang 2018. set up a news channel on Naver main! Blockchain, a key technology that will transform the digitally based society, has recently come under pressure, with block chains judged to equal the value of the Internet that has completely changed its industrial structure. It is because of the wild wind of Bitcone.It is thanks to the block chain technology that a bit coin can function as a virtual call. Block chain refers to a technology that ensures reliability without authorized third parties by jointly verifying and recording transaction information within a network. When the transaction details are changed, the contents are disclosed to all of the transaction participants and are reflected in the book. It is impossible to hack. That is why the principle of currency, trust, is created.One coin in 2009 cost 39 cents. It is currently around 20 million won. The reason why the block chain is recognized as Bitcone, and Bitcone is recognized as Gambling. Overseas, block chains also act as the "" magic "" of the stock market. Long Island Block Chain, ' the ice tea company's Long-Ailand-A company, saw its stock price surge 275 percent after it changed its name, according to the British daily Financial Times. It is just a company that makes non-alcoholic lemonade and iced tea. We can`t explain why stock prices have soared, except that the word block chains has become attached to the company`s name, said TechCrunch, an IT professional media organization.Such a situation would naturally drive the discussion toward the Virtual Monetary Control. There are even warnings from home and abroad that ' virtual currencies are bubble. ' The government has also suggested setting the Bitcone Regulation. The government warned on July 28 that "" virtual currencies are not a legal currency and could be severely damaged due to fluctuations in prices. "" In addition, it proposed related regulatory measures, such as mandatory trading of real names in virtual currencies.However, some in the government said, "" We are concerned that the technology of block chains might be damaged. "" Bitcone is being mentioned as being mixed with the block chain, said Science and Technology Information Minister Yoo Young-min at a news conference on July 22, potentially hurting the block chain. The ministry is known to have strongly expressed its position at the ministry`s joint meeting that Bitcons and block chains must be separated. Foreign experts also stress, ' A block chain is never a bit coin. ' Although the block chain enables bit-coining, it is only one of the infinite possibilities that block chain technologies can apply. Block chain is a key technology that can increase the safety of data and the effectiveness of transactions in the age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It can be used in a wide range of fields, including finance (personal certification), logistics (history management), medical (insurance claim), and administration (electronic voting). In Korea, Samsung SDS, SK C&C ; and LG CNS are also leading block chain technologies. Industry officials said, We had a lot of questions from our customers at the beginning of the year about what the block chain was, but recently asked what we could do with it. Whether it is the financial or medical circles, we are beginning to see the possibility of a block chain, he said.It is true that the current situation works against the block chain but there is an opportunity. Until this year, the Ministry of Information and Communication had donated some of its associated budget items such as the IoT and supported the block chain. However, starting next year, the company secured a new budget for block chains. We secured 4.5 billion won from the Block Chain Technology Development budget and 4.2 billion won from the pilot project next year, said an official at the Communication Ministry, getting more power to create a full-fledged block chain boom. We will create successful block chains and expand the market by supporting small and midsize businesses, he said.

China is a very important source of oil for North Korea. But the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 2375, restricting the sale of refined petroleum products to North Korea to two million barrels a year (about 250,000 tons) and the sale of crude oil to the United States to be less than 4 million.

The ruling and opposition parties agreed to further agree on the bill`s efforts to draw up a constitutional amendment as soon as possible and to seek a revision between negotiating groups in February. The ruling Grand National Party and the main opposition Grand National Party, which demanded an unconditional extension of the committee by June next year, and the people's party's party's demand to integrate a special committee on constitutional amendment were fulfilled. The Democratic Party, which had insisted on a temporary extension until next February, also saved its justification by leaving the possibility of an additional agreement open. The ruling and opposition parties also agreed to hold parliamentary by-elections on the resignation of chairman of the National Assembly, the head of the National Policy Committee and the head of the National Defense Commission during the plenary session. The committee will be represented by the Korea Party in its first half of the 20s, when it agrees to hold the position. The Democratic Party has called for concessions from the ruling party based on the parliamentary practice of being led by the chairman of the presidential office of the ruling camp, but backed out of favor of the party by agreeing to back off from the party in the first half. The ruling and opposition parties decided to organize a special committee to reform the judiciary. The subsidiaries have a court, a judicial branch, a police reform subcommittee and a prosecution reform committee. The committee has 17 members and the deadline for their activities is the end of June next year.

The ruling and opposition parties plan to extend the special committee on the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics to the end of March next year. The Water Management and Unification Management Act will make all-out efforts to deal with the problem next February. The main part of the talk on water management, which is to unify water management divided by the Ministry of Environment (Ministry of Water Quality) and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (quantity), has been delayed handling due to opposition from the Korea Party. The ruling and opposition parties also decided to pass a revision to the local tax law, a revision to the National Finance Law, and an agreement to the National Science and Technology Advisory Council by holding an administrative and financial committee respectively. The over defense commission recommends the Korea Communications Standards Commission 3. After the agreement was announced, floor leader Woo Won-shik told reporters, I have no way to explain to each other that unless former GNP floor leader Chung Woo-taek steps down, I have agreed to the management committee. As for the technique of being used as a member of the water management, the National Assembly has decided to guarantee the treatment by February, Woo said. We also agreed not to include former prosecutors as part of the prosecution reform package, although it does not appear in the phrase, he added. Though we failed to agree on a written agreement, we will in fact have a public hearing in February next year to deal with the special bill, Kim Sung-tae, floor leader of the National Assembly, said. Uri Party floor leader Wu said, I will deal with the special law in February and guarantee it.

"[Anchor] It's been a little cold today, but the unexpected fine dust has come.I heard that it will snow or rain all over the country on weekends, so I will check the detailed weather. Hey, caster Kwon! How much did you get this morning?The temperature in Seoul is currently 0.8 degrees Celsius higher than the same time yesterday.The temperature will rise to 6 degrees Celsius during the day, and will be milder than usual.However, fine dust always becomes a problem when the cold is slowed, as the air is still suspended in the morning and fine dust concentration in China in the afternoon will be dense in most parts of the country due to smog.Now, it is mostly cloudy across the country and the visibility is very dim with fog and dust mixed up. Until morning, it will be scattered in the west, with some raindrops and some snow flurries.The temperature of Seoul will be 6 degrees Celsius during the day, Daejeon 8 degrees Celsius, and Gwangju 9 degrees Celsius higher than yesterday.It will snow all over the country from tomorrow afternoon, the last weekend of this year, to holidays.Especially with the central part of the nation planning to get plenty of snow tomorrow night around 10cm. After that, it will stop snowing the morning after tomorrow, and then on New Year's Day, the temperature will drop to - 7, bringing cold snap.The alarm is, and other dry in the donghae donghae of, Youngnam, Chungbuk, Korea and South Jeolla Province in dry weather warning is in effect.Please pay attention to the fire control.So far, this is YTN Kwon Hye In.Watch my New Year's news in 2018. Please make friends with YTN. It was the first time you received a report on the cancellation of the parking lot [The first place you visited was YTN & the only place you found possible] [The Dong-A Ilbo, when you reported the illegal copying and redistributing. Six minutes later, rescue teams arrived inside the building. One minute after arrival, rescue teams found an emergency staircase behind the building while installing an air mat to rescue a person who was hanging from the third floor. The flames have not yet reached this place. If you walk up one floor and open the emergency exit, there is a sauna on the second floor. Inside, 20 people were anxiously waiting to be rescued. One woman who was in Yeotang around 3:59 p.m., just before the fire brigade arrived, said, I can`t breathe. Please come upstairs. It was such a pressing call that the word ‘ hurry ’ was used 79 times. The station workers immediately radioed the field crew : Go upstairs. But rescuers who found the emergency staircase headed to the ground floor, not to the second floor. So Golden Time passed.It was confirmed on July 28 that the fire fighters at the scene, including rescue teams, could not hear the situation radio because their cellular phones were dead. The search is against the background of searching the wrong place. The rescue team heard from the fire chief about 4:30 p.m. when they completed their search for the first basement floor. Then, I set up ladder on the second floor. After breaking the common glass, they entered the building, but the structure of the survivors was late. The rescue commander who went to the scene told The Dong-A Ilbo on July 28, "" There was no information except that it was a first-story fire. "" Of course, he decided that all floors were occupied and went into the most dangerous underground room in the first floor fire. If I heard that there were many people on the second floor, I would definitely have gone in first. The fire department in North Chungcheong Province immediately radioed the field office after reporting earlier that more than 10 people had been isolated by a female bath on the second floor. ' Rescue services, quickly to the second floor, woman. Woman Upstairs. ' But there was no response at the scene. It is because he could not hear radio. At 4:04 p.m., the emergency room called fire inspector, who plays the head of the field department, to report the situation on the second floor. We will carry out an on-site rescue, the fire inspector replied. However, the radio failed and the firefighters were unable to report the situation on the second floor. As reports poured in, the control room called the fire inspector again two minutes later to report the urgent situation. Due to the dense smoke, it is difficult to enter the second floor, said a fire inspector. We called the situation room three minutes past four in the afternoon and said, We have rescue workers on the third and fourth floors, and we know fire investigators. We will do rescue work. The fire inspector called the commander of the riot police to inform them of the situation, but could not get through. At the time, the commander of the riot police was not able to radio, so he was ordering the riot police by cell phone. The commander of the riot police accidentally met a fire inspector while searching the scene on the third floor. Then I heard that people were trapped in the bath on the second floor. Our portable radio was useless because it was not a communication. At that time, I was so busy that I, the commander of the mine, had to put out the fire myself. Under such circumstances, with the phone calls pouring in and no radio messages, I could not find anyone anywhere else.○ Mobile radio companies in North Chungcheong Province are investigating the reasons why portable radios did not work properly at the fire site. Firefighters at Jecheon Fire Station said, "" Mobile radios were useless even in normal times, as Jecheon has a shaded area without radio signals. "" The commander of the riot police said, "" Since the cellular phone often failed at the scene, I ordered the phones to operate. "" Some portable radios have poor sensitivity in shadow areas, but each fire engine is equipped with fixed mobile base station radios that communicate well with the situation room. However, few firefighters sit on fire trucks with their radios set in for the moment. If the portable radio is not working properly, the function of the situation room to spread the situation over the field by radio is virtually paralyzed. 119 To move, the fire department in a metropolitan area receives a report and instructs the fire department in the area to fire, rescue, and emergency. The fire department consolidated its fire department's situation room to 17 first-tester fire stations with a budget of 50.1 billion won from 2006 to 2014. The fire department in Cheongju has a situation room in the North Chungcheong Province that orders the entire province to move. It is 87.5 kilometers from the scene of the fire in Jecheon. The situation in Jecheon is difficult for the office staff to grasp. When we had fire stations in the past, each fire station had their own situation room, so their employees gave precise instructions on local issues, but they could not communicate well after they were consolidated by area, one firefighter said.Jecheon : Kim Bae-jung, Kim Dong-hyeok, and Josik, a reporter of The Dong-A Ilbo, alone and with the official Facebook page of The Dong-A Ilbo, is banned from redistributing the circulation of bills via the online bulletin (click!) via the Bank of Philippines ' edition of errors.

The Bank of the Philippines (BSP) then explained on July 28 that the bill with no face was caused by a typographical error and that it was merely 0.00009 percent of the bill's total circulation. So far, 33 of the printing error bills have been found. The central bank asked the banks to exchange the bills for other bills, although they are valid legal bills, instead they should be used. ▶ kms1234@yna.co.kr article 1:1 ▶ In the latest trends and report and your reporter north-central ship, oil transshipment to international waters ""don't at the relevant ships, port 中"" 韓 to leave.Hong Kong ""I don't know specific situation"" related fuel supply in ships, 北 hwachuning [Chinese Foreign Ministry] (= Beijing, Yonhap News Agency), Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, gimjinbang correspondent : Donald Trump.The United States president between North Korea, Japan, China and Russia, the alleged smuggling of petroleum, oils, and ""disappointed with China."" high rhetoric between North Korea, Japan, China and Russia, for China's fuel trafficking is not true, countered.
