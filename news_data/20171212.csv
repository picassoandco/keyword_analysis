When the bus changes its lane without turning on a direction indicator or when the distance from the car ahead is less than three meters, it sets off lights and alarms. A cushion of the vibrator (left circle) at the driver's seat back also sounds. The government has installed a sleep prevention device on the metropolitan bus to stop drowsy driving, but many say it is inefficient. Kim Dong-hyeok, journalist at hack@donga.com "" It's cool to face. Sometimes he changes the car line without blinking to use it as a vibrator, "" said a 57-year-old driver, turning his wheel to the right on a local bus. The bus stomped slightly on the lane, and a ‘ beep ’ was heard from the driver's seat. At the same time, the vibrator she spoke to resonated in two sessions of three seconds. The massage machine that Kim said was none other than a sleep prevention device. If the bus changes its lane without turning on a direction indicator or closes to within three meters of the vehicle ahead, a warning tone is emitted to warn the driver. It was installed on 2,500 buses in the Seoul metropolitan area after the accident in July last year, which killed and killed 50 couples.Bus drivers expected the device to help keep people from falling asleep at the wheel of what they call the "" Death Dead. "" However, the reaction of the site was less than expected. Seven of the 21 bus drivers whom Dong-A Ilbo reporters met on July 8-11 had either used the device as a "" driver's massage "" or drove with the device removed. The other eight said, I can hardly feel the vibrations because the bus itself is vibrating a lot while it is running and the clothes are thick in the winter. The other six said, "" It works to some extent. "" The government has proposed various measures to improve the poor working conditions of bus drivers. However, this has not worked well on the spot, either. An operating driver, Ahn, 58, who arrived at the heartland of a bus company in the Seoul metropolitan area around 10 a.m. yesterday ran to the bathroom as soon as the bus stopped. Ahn drove around Seoul Sadang Station for about three hours before returning home. It took 4 minutes from the bathroom to the bus, and 12 minutes to clean the trash and gas the bus. It was the first time I'd been back in 18 minutes to sit in the driver's seat and start my car again. Although I tend to stick to ` 15 minute breaks after two hours of driving after an accident ` like a knife, I can`t rest because I have many chores to deal with during that time, Ahn said. The government will install rest facilities at five subway stations. But currently, the only Seoul Jamsil Station transfer center. Yangjae Station is scheduled to be completed next year. Sadang Station, Gangnam Station, Seoul Station uses the same public restrooms as before. There is no room to stop the bus, so it is a "" pie in the sky "" for drivers. None of the five drivers who met at Seoul Station used the public restrooms. Government measures to guarantee a minimum of 10 hours of rest before the following day's operation are not kept either. A bus driver (47) who runs between Gangnam Station and Goyang City said, As there are not enough drivers, he had to leave the office three or four hours after the accident. As more and more poorly equipped bus drivers move to larger companies, the bus industry is facing a growing labor shortage. Some companies have even eliminated intra-city bus routes to maintain more lucrative local bus routes. Bus routes to Suwon and Ansan have been decreasing by about 20 percent since the incident, making it inconvenient for citizens who used to take the route, an official said.Kim Dong-hyeok, reporter at hack@donga.com Hong Seong-chul, journalist, What kind of income, 400,000 won in housing, 29 year olds, 22 % of housing expenses in my youth income, 22 % of housing costs to live in my home? "" "" U.S. and Europe, I think it's fair to say, 25 % to 30 % on the road map. 5.4 % of households in Korea, or 3.1 million households, live in areas that do not meet the minimum residential standards. This is a mechanical distinction, but the housing vulnerable is much larger. Various residential policies are being announced for them, but the working class asks, "" Where is the time to study when you're busy keeping your head above water? "" Too many people give up their right to live because they can't reach their skin and don't know what's in it for themselves. Explain three different reasons why housing welfare is not working, including policy and site gaps.At 8:10 p.m. on July 7, he climbed the stairs of the steel and went to the rooftop of Munjeon-hyeon (alias : 29). It was the top of a three-story house, but it was dark because the higher buildings were blocking the lights. When I opened the rooftop room door, I felt warm. I turned on the boiler an hour ago. "" How close to the sky, isn't it? "" Jun-hyun said. He, who lived in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province, went to Seoul in October 2015 due to work. He used to live in Gokswon, and in January last year secured a deposit of 3 million won and 370,000 won per month, and secured a 7-pyeong (23-square) rooftop room in Susan-dong, Seoul. I don't see any particular inconveniences. "" "" Open the door and you'll see an open roof, it's nice to dry the laundry or to wipe the bedding …. I'm satisfied with my life, "" adds one thing. "" I just didn't want to make any money, "" said Jun-hyeon, a small business worker, with a hold on her hands for about 1.8 million won per month. If you add utilities, heating bills, electricity, and water bills to the monthly rent, it costs a little over 400,000 won. About 22 % of the salary is spent entirely on housing. It costs around 200,000 won a month to repay student loans and the cost of transportation insurance, which can exceed the fixed cost of one million won per month. It's hard to think of installment savings. When they get extra money each month, they accumulate it in their bank accounts, but the balance is about the same as it was several months ago. "" I had to live on extra money so I met two friends once and ate something expensive. Monthly rent is most unsatisfactory. "" He said, "" When I get home from work, I feel lonely in a room without anyone. "" In these winter, they turn on the boiler to avoid the cold, but they turn off the boiler after an hour due to heating worries. When I feel frustrated, I go to the rooftop. I like the view from above. "" When Junhyun and the building around Seobo were on the rooftop, most of them had rooftop rooms. The situation of the residents will be similar to that of Jun-hyun. The train roared past the search station. The ratio of housing costs to income (RIR) is a valid concept to look into the condition of those like Jun Hyun. Jun-hyun is about 22 percent, and in the United States and Europe, when the ratio reaches 25-30 percent, he or she supports housing. It is recognized as a residential problem as it can cause a decline in the standard of daily living, such as the cost of food, education, medical expenses, and savings. In particular, those in their 20s who have no assets and have relatively low incomes have no choice but to link their housing costs directly to the standard of living. The government announced its ' Housing and Welfare Roadmap ' on July 29. It was real estate investors who showed great interest in policies designed for the underprivileged in residential areas such as Joon-hyun. When investors opened the road map, analyzing the market power of the supply of one million homes, the young rooftop house said, I knew there was a policy announcement but didn`t look into it. Even though there were benefits that apply to him, such as the Youth Recruitment Account. When asked why, he says : "" There is no expectation in the first place. Will you get me a benefit? Get your own house, I've thought about it before, but I've already given up. It's literally a dream : "" The fact that the housing market is somewhat distorted by the policies for the underprivileged in housing.Lý Long Tường sotong203@kmib.co.kr[ Hong Sung-chul, a Kookmin Ilbo website ] [Facebook] [covering daeaengso with a whistle!)

"▽ New South Korean : At 6:22 a.m. on July 9, a video clip of 6 U.S. soldiers from Japan was found in baggage at the airport terminal in downtown Seoul. The photo showed 6 luggage magazines of U.S. soldiers on the way to Okinawa, Japan. According to the Airport Railroad and Police Agency on July 12, they were searching for luggage by U.S. soldiers of U.S. Forces Korea (U.S. Army) during an X-ray search at the baggage management system of a 2-story downtown airport on the second floor of Seoul Station. Many empty cartridges were also found in the clips. Upon detection, airport railway security search agents reported the incident to police, and handed over all of the stolen magazines and shell casings to the Yongsan Police Station. The magazine that soldier M had is a clip of an M4 carbin 5.56mm rifle in use by U.S. soldiers, experts say. Police took over the soldier from the airport railway and conducted a joint investigation with the police, but they sent him to Japan because they could not find any specific questions. The confiscated magazine was handed over to the U.S. military police. The Seoul Metropolitan Airport Terminal, an airport facility in downtown Seoul, is operated by the Airport Railroad and provides early check-in services, which enables Korean Air, Asiana Airlines, Jeju Airlines, China Southern Airlines and T-way Airlines to proceed with boarding procedures and departure tests. The airport railway earlier detected live bullets and gas guns in passenger luggage, each attempting to board a plane bound for Japan and the United States in July and early December. mania@newsis.comLee Young-hak, a father of molar who was arrested for killing a middle school girl and attempting to replace her dead, enters Seoul's northern district of Dobong County in the morning of July 17 for a trial. ▽ Seoul correspondent of Pontugh=Newsis.com = Newscession=NewsTeacher Lee Young-hak (35) allegedly assaulted his daughter repeatedly. But Lee denied that he had scold severely, saying, I have never been habitually attacked. During the third hearing in Seoul on July 12, when the criminal consensus of the northern District Court was decided by Lee Seong-ho, the chief judge of the Supreme Court, Lee Young-hak attended a trial on her daughter, Lee (14) who was charged with encouraging minors and dumping her body. Lee's lawyer accused her of habitual violence such as throwing objects or hitting her on the cheek. But Lee said he had never yelled harshly or thrown a bag, but that there was no habitual violence. Lee said, As for why I followed Lee without much resistance or questioning, I once hit six dogs with a hammer in anger. I think my daughter was scared because she knew this. Lee stated that she was "" afraid I was right, "" as a reason she followed her father's instructions. Asked when he was most shocked, he replied, "" It is time to get hit on the head with a bag. "" The court decided to have a mental examination to see why Lee followed her father's instructions without much resistance. Park (36), who is accused of helping Lee escape, was released on bail. The court's ruling is prolonged and Park's knowledge of the crime when he helped Yi is debatable. The court is set to hold a trial of Lee Young-hak on Jan. 10 next year to hear further accusations against him. Prosecutors plan to indict Lee further on charges of fraud, encouragement of donations, forcing and assault on his wife. Lee was arrested on September 30 for luring back A (14), reported sleeping pills, and reported the remains of a psychotropic drug to the local court. Lee was charged with luring back friend A to her home under the instruction of her father, Lee, and releasing the body with Lee. Although Park knew of Lee`s crime, he moved Lee`s luggage to his car, evacuated Lee`s wife and contacted a real estate broker who helped Lee save a studio in Dobong-gu, Seoul. jabiu@newsis.com○ People's rights and interests in the downtown area, which had shown cautious attitude in passing the revision to the Enforcement Decree of the Kim Young-ran Act, "" as if they had changed the revision to Prime Minister's remark before the Lunar New Year's Day, "" and "" Food and Food and Drug Commission demanded 50,000 won per serving. "" The enrichment industry is unhappy with the "" futures "" market failing to get out of recession despite a 100,000 won rise, and the government is likely to stir up a wave of balanced requests from other industries, and the government is worried about it. It is a matter of time before the law was worn out by the government, and the authorities concerned were quick to respond to criticism that they were mindful of the votes of farmers, livestock and fishermen. What worries us right now is the restaurant industry's demand for an increase in the price of meals (30,000 won). The restaurant industry has been demanding that the maximum limit be raised to at least 50,000 won since the law was enforced last September. The report said that a cap should be set on the 2003 level to reflect inflation. The Korea Food and Drug Administration conducted a sales impact survey and reported that 73.8 percent of Korean restaurants saw their sales decline due to the enforcement of laws. Though the agricultural and livestock industries expected the upper limit to be raised, they remained aloof, saying, "" Since the market has become so sluggish, could it be effective? "" Lee Sang-no, who raises hanu in Hoengseong-gun, forecast that the demand for luxury land and land such as sirloin and security will not grow significantly, saying, We can only provide bulgogi sets at 100,000 won a month. Critics say that the commission has surrendered to pressure from political circles and neutralized the bill, which was first proposed and enforced by then chairman of the Commission on National Rights and Human Rights in June 2011, by reason. The core of the Appropriations Act, ‘ Regulations for the Protection of Pations, ’ which stipulates that the government is entitled to revise the provisions of meals less than 30,000 won, gifts less than 50,000 won, and the cost of business expenses less than 100,000 won, not in the National Assembly. Pressure on the previous administration to revise the law has also been on its side. Ahead of the New Year in January this year, hwanggyoan, the government acting president under the guidance for Economic Development in the revision work and karaoke bars from the list but the protest was stopped by. Park Eun-jung, chairman of the Commission, also stressed during a news conference in July that the revision should be more cautious and requires a procedural process of social consensus, as is the corporation that receives the most support. However, the president after the briefing, Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, Ministry of Agriculture, Food and relevant ministries, such as the pressure, "" line can be concentrated to fisheries can be (revision) so that people realize.Changed its position on rights and interests made by Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon, '' scheduled. Coincidentally, Prime Minister Lee and Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Kim Young-choon are both politicians who should be aware of the farmers and fishermen's votes.On the other hand, a substantial number of people are in favor of the 3-5-10 rule. In a poll released in September by the Korea Institute of Public Administration, 61.4 percent of the public, 67 percent of public officials and 70.7 percent of public officials ` organizations answered it was appropriate. It was also reported that the committee under its approval on the same day expressed concern, mainly by external non-executive members, saying, I doubt that the majority of the public wanted the revision. In addition, domestic agricultural, livestock and fisheries products are subject to control of the ceiling according to the World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations, so the domestic agricultural, livestock and fisheries industries can not laugh the same way.

"SK Telecom Disapproves Some Limits to Change of 3G and LTE Money…Display SK Telecom Goes Back to the Track with an Official Limit of 2G Customers ' 3GLTE Pricing According to the telecommunications industry on July 12, SK Telecom will restrict 2G users from signing up for the LTE full payment system based on the government's implementation order and terms of use of its 010 number integration policy starting July 26. In addition, the mobile phone authentication and mobile security payment (ISP) services offered to 2G handsets will be shut down starting July 31 due to the poor utilization rates. In the past, there were many users who used 3G and LTE rates even though they were 2G users by using the expedient method. They have built and used so-called 2G smartphones using overseas terminals that can simultaneously use 2G (CDMA) and 3G (WCDMA). An SK Telecom official said, "" In the past, 2G subscribers were not allowed to use 3G phones simultaneously to obtain the limitations of the network. In fact, when searching for 2G smartphones on portal sites, one can often find cases of registering 2G smartphones and used deal sales posts. The measure is to normalize abnormal use of the product based on terms of use, rather than having to do with the end of 2G, the official explained. LG U-Plus also restricts 2G users from signing up for the 3GLTE fee based on their terms of use. In response, some users who used to make ' 2G smartphones ' are protesting. In particular, subscribers who use the 01 X number, such as 011, 016, 017, 018, or 019, are opposed to the change in the number following the 2G termination and use the 3G, AT number on the 6th only. The Act also provided that the government should introduce the temporary number transfer system in 1999 to allow the transfer of the numbers to the new communication service with the number X to be returned with the cancellation, transfer of the number, transfer of the name, and death of the users. As of 9:00 a.m. on July 12, the number of people who have applied for the petition has exceeded 1,176. According to the Ministry of Science and Technology and Information, the number of 2G subscribers stood at 278,845 as of October. SK Telecom has 1,153,777 employees, LG U-Plus 1,797,987, and saving phones 159,841. KT closed 2G in 2012, and SK Telecom and LG U-Plus are due to end by 2021 when the spectrum allocation period ends. The number of 2G subscribers continues to decline. Last year saw a decline of about 1,110,000 from 2015, and according to the current trend, the figure is expected to be about one million by the end of the year. Jeong Yoon-hee /yuni@heraldcorp.com[Social Trend 2017] Residential choice is "" Near City "" (Sejong = News 1) Choi Kyung-hwan : More and more of the working couples are depending on their parents for housework and childcare. In particular, support from in-laws has increased. According to Korean Social Trends 2017, the percentage of working couples who received positive "" instrumental support "" from their spouses was 19 percent and 7.9 percent from their employers, which was announced on July 12 by the National Statistical Office. Ten years ago, the ratio was 17 percent and 14 percent, respectively, which is a huge increase in the help of the in-laws and a decrease in the amount of money the market has helped. Even when not working together, 12.3 percent of wives and 6.3 percent of in-laws helped out. The term "" instrumental support "" refers to the provision of childcare, cleaning, meals, shopping, and errands for the family. The proportion of support for the tool was more than doubled to 83.5 percent for "" Very Often, "" and to 7.1 percent for "" Often. "" As women engaged in economic activities, such as housework and childcare, their parents helped them, the statistics office estimated. ■ News 1 : Although the town centre still tends to be the residential area of Bang Eun-young, the number of frequent visitors has dropped slightly. The distance between the two families was wide, with the number of "" within 15 minutes of walking "" accounting for 13.7 percent of the poem and the number of wives at home to 9.1 percent. In the 2006 survey, there were no significant differences between 8.4 % and 7.3 %. The ratio of contact with each person more than once a week was higher with 71.5 percent and 73.4 percent. In the survey conducted in 2006, 79.4 percent of the respondents said they saw the market price rise and 72.9 percent of their in-laws. The ratio of those who actively provided financial support to their parents was 24.9 percent with their in-laws and 30.6 percent with their parents. Ten years ago, the ratio was 17.6 percent and 31.2 percent, respectively, which is much higher than that of their in-laws when it comes to helping poem. The survey looked at married parents of both their own parents and their spouses, who are currently alive for more than one point each, and who are married over the age of 18 years old without their parents. Employment simulated infant homes increased from 45.9 percent in 2012 to 66.5 percent in 2015. The supply and demand rate of home care benefits for non-business-career households rose significantly from 6 % in 2012 to 39.2 % in 2015. The most important reason is that the full course of the Nuri Arts Festival in 2013 will receive support for one of the following : home support allowance, child support, and infant education. However, primary school students who end up earlier than their children's homes only use 23.3 percent of elementary schools, which means their parents have to pay more for childcare than their children's homes."
"○ Risk-sharing investment boom Earlier this month, my friend told me that she bought a virtual coin ' Bitcone ' in November and earned 10 million won in three weeks. It constantly occurred to me that we don`t have the money to invest in real estate, so we should buy virtual bills, said Kim, who borrowed 50 million won to add to his newly-weeking home after a month of rolling around. Kim`s ' Make 100 Million Won Charged'project was completed in a matter of days. The investment amount reached 83 million won in two days and sank to 47 million won two more days later. `` I hardly slept for the market to crash during the two days, '' he said. `` I stepped out of the virtual currency as soon as I got back to the original capital. ''▽ Crash of 14 million won to 19 million won = The electronic board of the virtual currency exchange, Bit-Sam, in Jung-gu, Seoul, was restored on July 11 and was traded at 24 million won per coin on July 8. Among virtual currency investors around the world, Korea is called the "" Ground Zero "" (bomb point). It means that it is unbeatable in terms of investment fever and the number of market participants. Local investors alone are estimated to have surpassed the market price of 2 million won per share on the KOSDAQ ' Friend's friend made 3 billion won from Virtual coin investments, ' adding, ' I earn 100 million won per month in advance. ' Some say that the virtual currency frenzy is comparable to the "" Saerom technology, "" which has recorded as the biggest bubble in Korean stock market history since its listing in 1999, and the "" Sea Story scandal of 2006, "" which led to gambling stations nationwide.◇ Virtual money boom, which started with two to three times a day with the interest of young people who are interested in ' mixed-cone ' or ' mixed-investment ' investment technologies, has recently spread to students, housewives, and the elderly. A high school student who took the College Scholastic Ability Test in Seoul said, "" I bought coins from my savings account right after the college entrance exam. "" "" I used my smartphone with an app from the Virtual Monetary Exchange and had a part-time job. "" It is not necessary to buy a bit coin by itself. A small investment can be made by dividing it by 8 decimal places, by one in 100 million.There was also a new kind of scam, which combined virtual currency and multI-step bills for the elderly who are not familiar with virtual currency, and a return of profits to virtual machines that can make virtual currency.A ' inquisition-free investment ', which buys a new (hybrid) coin (hybrid) instead of a well known virtual coin, is also in vogue (non-binding coin). Internet communities related to virtual currency investment can see hundreds of messages posted each day : Gazua! ○○ Coins. Kazua, whose pronunciation is stressed and adapted, means higher coin prices. Lee (35), an office worker who is investing 30 million won in miscellaneous fees, said, "" If you do well in a day, you will get paid by the dozen. You will get paid by the sweat of your brow. ""◇ Why is it so bad to be in Korea? ¡ ° IT infrastructure ¡ ° Han Thang-ism ¡ ° adds fuel ¡ ° and the cash-investment craze is worldwide. Unlike other assets, such as stock, gold, and real estate, virtual currency is difficult to assess its proper value, so it is highly variable in price. For example, the virtual coin, or the virtual coin, has a wide variety of values, ranging from 0 won per coin to $ 200 million per coin, depending on the evaluator. It is also a characteristic of the 24 hour trade on 365 days a year, so fear and greed spread continuously.Bitsum, the nation's largest virtual currency exchange, conducted a server check to stabilize the server market on July 11.Experts say Korea's unique cultural and social infrastructure is the reason why it is especially prone to overheating of virtual currencies here. The characteristic of virtual currency, like the "" lights "", is that it is matched by the Korean people's trendy mentality and a well-fitting IT infrastructure, which helps to spread rapidly. In addition, some analyze that virtual currency has penetrated the sentiments of the working class who have been alienated from the real estate investment boom in recent years. Many people say that virtual money is the only opportunity to get out of the country. As Hong Ki-hun, a business school professor at Hongik University, said, As the domestic capital market lacks high-risk, high-return assets and gambling is officially prohibited, the capital that would call high yield can quickly become virtual money.As the Compricators ' Daily & Chosun.com, No Jack-up and Redistribution - [Photo : iPhone global weather application] launched in winter, Asian economy reporter Dong Hyun Woo South Korea recorded much lower temperatures than other major northern European countries as the cold wave caused by the North Pole shaking and global warming has brought the Arctic's cold air mass to the peninsula. According to the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), the lowest temperature in Seoul was minus 12.2 degrees Celsius on July 12. As of 9 a.m., some areas in the metropolitan area, including Seoul, Namyangju, Yangpyeong, Gimpo, Cheorwon, Yanggu, and Inje University, were included in the "" risks "" phase (below - 15.4 degrees). If the sensation temperature is ' dangerous ' during outdoor activities for a long time, there is a risk of frostbite and hypothermia. Seoul received a cold snap warning yesterday, and Gyeonggi Province's Paju, Uijeongbu, Yangju, Pocheon, Yeoncheon and Dongducheon issued a cold snap warning.(Photo : Naver weather) Seoul had a much cooler temperature today than other major cities in the North. According to the World Meteorological Organization, Moscow recorded minus one degree, Helsinki in Finland minus zero, Oslo, Norway minus two, and Copenhagen, Denmark minus one degree. Temperatures in Seoul on the north face of the peninsula are more than 11 degrees lower than in Moscow, at 55 degrees north. It is common knowledge that the weather in winter is colder as it gets closer to the poles, but this winter it is broken.Even compared with cities of similar latitudes, Seoul has been considerably cooler. Other cities with similar latitudes in Seoul are Tokyo, China, Beijing, Portugal, Spain, Madrid and Athens. It can not be compared to the mild Mediterranean countries of Lisbon, Madrid and Athens in the winter, but the temperatures in Seoul are much lower than those of Tokyo, which recorded 7 degrees of images, and Beijing, which recorded minus 5 degrees. Especially, it is 7 degrees colder than Beijing, which is famous for its harsh winter than Seoul due to its close proximity to the desert.▽ Data = The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) said that "" Arctic shaking "" and "" global warming "" are the main reasons why cold waves crashed on the Korean Peninsula even within Northeast Asia. First, Arctic oscillation refers to the increase and decrease of the cold air mass in northern high latitudes, from a lesser day to a greater decades. The cold air in the Arctic Circle is usually blocked by jet streams surrounding the North Pole, so it can not go south until the jet stream begins to weaken. According to the Korea Meteorological Administration, the Arctic Vibration Index (AO) has shown a negative trend since mid-November, with frigid air moving toward the mid - latitudes. When the Arctic Vibration Index shows negative values as of this year, cold air from the Arctic regions tends to go down as the turbulence begins to ease, causing temperatures in the mid - to mid-latitude regions to fall below average.(Data : The Korea Meteorological Administration) An increasing number of cold weather teams flock to the Korean Peninsula due to global warming. According to the Korea Meteorological Administration, another reason for the cold was the Arctic's cold air mass surge over the nation as the upper high pressure formed near the Ural Mountains and Kara Sea in northern Russia was stalled. High atmospheric pressure is often formed around the North Pole this year as glaciers in the Barents and Kara coasts, adjacent to the North Pole, decreased more than normal due to global warming effects. Especially this summer, as the heat wave is earlier than usual due to global warming, the winter has become more severe as the number of glaciers in the Arctic has decreased. This year, the Daegu and Gyeongbuk regions issued heat reports one month earlier than usual, and in June, the first heat wave warning was issued in Seoul. According to the Korea Meteorological Administration, the nation's highest temperature was 30.6 degrees Celsius during July, 1.8 degrees higher than the average year (28.8 degrees).

"▽ Seoul's Central Manhattan = Bomb Attack = Four people including suspects are going to be injured in Seoul. Some point out that the suspect's original aim was to take the subway on his way to work on Monday morning, nearly leading to a major disaster. CNN quoted a judicial official as saying, "" The terrorists Akayede Ulla (27) pledged allegiance to IS during the investigation. "" Authorities are investigating whether the pledge of loyalty is genuine and whether it is linked to terrorist groups. New York State Governor Andrew Coomo said, Although the suspect is not part of a sophisticated (terrorist) network, it appears to have been "" inspired by IS or other extremist groups. "" The New York Times (NYT) reported that Ulla planned the bomb attack in return for the U.S. attack on IS in Syria. However, foreign news reports are mixed as to the motive for the crime. CNN reported that Ulla told investigators, ' The recent Israeli action in Gaza '. Israel is Donald Trump, president of the United States 'Jerusalem the capital city recognition' after the declaration of an air raid the Gaza Strip after heightened conflict with the Palestinians. NYT said it was the Christmas poster that led him to pick an underground passage near the Port Authority bus terminal. The poster suggested that 12 people were killed last year in the Berlin Christmas market. IS is again provoking terrorism ahead of Christmas.

The Internet user, who claimed to be the developer of virtual currency, said on Twitter, ' I will distribute the new virtual currency to existing Bitcons holders. ' Investors bought the bit coins, believing in the words, and saw their prices temporarily rise by 15 percent. However, when it turned out to be a joke, the price of Bitcone plunged immediately.The incident, which was attacked by a netizens ' joke, demonstrates how the virtual currency market is driven by empty rumors, madness and greed. More than two million Korean students, office workers, and housewives entered these markets and bought and sold more than 6 trillion won a day.

But unlike the previous bubble that took place at least within the drawing frame, virtual currencies have no rules or protection. If the bubble is in a head-gear in the past, virtual currency is like a non-regulating martial art that could lose its life, an analyst said. 1000 big shots, which account for 40 percent of the world's Bitcone, have a monopoly on information and capital and fight with the public. For example, the first developers of Bitcone have 1 million Bit-coins and 19 trillion won worth of Seoul.There is no real virtual currency that exists solely in the network, and no assessment of intrinsic value is possible.

"Ship Captain and Flight Commission…Did the dead fishing boat captain "" No Complainant rights "" and the tanker captain (left) and deck crew member Choi Hyun-kyung were also found to have collided by Yonhap news agency's shipping company. The Incheon Maritime Police announced the final investigation results on July 12 and sent Jeon (37), the captain of the tanker Myeongjin 15 (336 ton grade), and Kim (46), to the prosecution as accusations. They were arrested on Thursday on suspicion of overturning of a ship that had been found guilty of negligence in duty. Maritime police also booked a captain Oh (70, and the dead) of a fishing boat that collided with a tanker on the same charge, but passed on to the prosecution as a record of not having "" no right to prosecute. "" The non-disciplinary power, a type of non-law action, is brought down when it is judged that the suspect is dead and can not be put to trial and that it is not practical to investigate. Jeon and Kim, who are in the middle of the East and West, were charged with fishing at 6:02 a.m. when they collided with a fishing boat pier 1.25 kilometers southwest of Jindung Island in Incheon. The pier, which was overturned after the collision, had 22 people on board at the time of the accident. Seven others, including three fishermen who survived the air pocket (the air pocket) for two hours and 43 minutes, were rescued by the Coast Guard. The Korea Coast Guard judged that Jeon neglected her duty because she did not decelerate to prevent a collision or changed her route even after discovering the fishing boat before the accident. "" At 6:12 a.m. that day, the distance between the two vessels was about 300 meters, "" a Coast Guard official said. "" We could not avoid the collision if we sailed (continued) in that condition. "" "" If you see an opponent ship (who may crash), you must radio and make it known (to be at risk of an accident) "" and "" reduce the speed of the vessel "" by using a "" whistle blower "" or "" in an instant. Article 66 of the Maritime Safety Act, "" Actions to avoid collision, "" requires that people take sufficient time to change the speed of a vessel or to actively respond to a whistle. We saw the fishing boat before the collision and knew we would avoid it, "" Jeon said, adding, "" After confirming the location of the fishing boat, I could not see the radar sensitivity of the vessel. "" Kim did not follow the safety manual of the Maritime Safety Act, which forbids one person's watch on night duty. He was found to have gone down to the inboard restaurant to drink water at the time of the accident while on duty as a group of two. Although the tankers did not know the accident was happening at the restaurant about four minutes before the collision, Kim admitted to being guilty of leaving the cockpit. The time of the accident was finally confirmed at the briefing. The Korea Coast Guard considered the first report to be made at 6:05 a.m., but decided to set the time of collision as 6:02 a.m. after analyzing the two ships ' track records. The Coast Guard estimated the speed of the tanker to have dropped by 12.3 to 12.5 knots (22.7-23.1 kilometers per hour) from 6 a.m. to 2.35 seconds before the accident on the third day before the accident, but estimated that it would have dropped by nearly no change in its speed at 6:45 a.m. The ship's captain, Jeon, who is licensed as a fifth-class sailor, reportedly operated the ship for 6-11 months without any problems with the conditions of her flight. However, it was confirmed that in April this year, he crashed into a Chinese cargo ship. The fishing boat captain Oh, who has operated the first pier since October 2015, also had a license to pilot a small boat, so it was OK to operate the boat, the Coast Guard said. It was also revealed that the tanker owner Lee was also on a deck crew at the time of the accident, and that the CCTV installed on the tanker had not been videotaped since July 29. However, it is not clear why the CCTV footage was not recorded from that point. The Coast Guard explained, "" As it is not mandatory to install the CCTVs, the violations of ship owners have not been confirmed so far. "" The Coast Guard also said, "" The survivors saw the tanker for 200 to 300 meters before the crash, and at that time, you can warn the captain that it was a (risk) death. "" At a news briefing held at the Incheonhaeseo International City Hall in Yonsu-gu, Incheon, several bereaved families of the victims attended and watched the announcement of the investigation results by the Coast Guard. We asked the Coast Guard for a CCTV screen showing my husband's last appearance, but we have not heard from him in over a week, one family member said earnestly, I earnestly desire to hear his breath. After the review, we will make sure to show the video to the bereaved families, said a Coast Guard official. We are taking it very seriously to the point that there were several immature measures in the process of handling the accident! We are going to investigate all the issues thoroughly after the government's ruling, "" adding, "" We will prepare the first photo interview with the union leader, and prepare the latest measures to prevent a recurrence of the incident. ""(Photo : Personnel Revolution Division) [Idaley Songira]] Since the establishment of the Civil Service Union Act in 2006, the government has settled on the issue for the first time in 11 years. The government, which has refused to approve of the system, has made a concession to officially deal with union members ' participation in the meeting once a year. It also decided to establish a new labor-management conference, in which government employees and their employers will talk about working conditions at all times. As the agreement between labor and management of the central government was reached for the first time in 11 years, it led to the opening of future talks.The Civil Service and the National Government Employees ' Union attended an agreement on the signing of the Public Affairs Committee and Personnel Director Kim Pan-seok at Seoul's Seoul-Cheong Government Office yesterday afternoon. It is the first time in 11 years that the union and management of the central government ministries have signed a single agreement. And an official of the directorate of personnel “The collective agreement negotiations resumed after the launch of the Moon Jae-in government administration suspended for long periods of 12 sessions on at the end of the deal.”.“Civil Service Labor are pitted against each other out at odds with the concession and compromise expected to be an occasion to create a new labor-management culture.” said. First of all, the government decided to break from its stance of refusing to allow time off under any circumstances and recognize the participation of union members in the annual regular meeting as an official vacation. The time off system bans employers from paying wages to full-time unionists in principle, but pays them only after accepting work hours for labor negotiations or dealing with grievances. In other words, the application of the time off system allows workers to work longer hours while being forced to work in union activities. However, the law, established in 2006, does not approve of the time-out system. The full-time union officials took time off from work and were paid for their work, but nearly 170 union delegates were required to attend the meeting on their own annual basis. He has consistently insisted on guaranteeing union activities, asking for leave of absence once a month. However, the government remained deadlocked, saying it would continue to be unacceptable, and this time it allowed the annual regular meeting to be dealt with once a year for the first time. The government will also set up and operate a win-win consultative body for labor and management to discuss musk on government employees ` work activities and benefits. It is considered a significant step in terms of the fact that the government and labor have set up a framework for dialogue. Ahn said, "" The agreement here is not about mere consultative bodies, but about small and binding collective bargaining ; what has occurred is that there has been an momentum, "" adding, "" It could improve the working conditions of union members. ""In addition, they tried not to discriminate against government employees who changed jobs due to job security, and actively promoted improvements in childcare leave, maternity leave, and the reinforcement of the right to rest in the public sector. The agreement will pave the way for the establishment of a culture of mutual respect and trust between labor and management, setting the stage for establishing cooperative labor-management relations in the public sector, said a government official. Ahn said, It is a shameful and regretful idea to present to unionists that we have concluded negotiations, but I will make it difficult for the union to initiate a new negotiation next year."
"[Donga Ilbo] Construction of Subway Line 5-8 ... Subway Line 10-12 and the empty space is located at Non-Dong subway station under the direction of Line 11, which is not yet utilizing the rest of the subway station. When the extension of Sindangdang Line (Sinsa Station to Gangnam Station) opens in 2022, the lines to Gangnam Station, Gwanggyo Station, and Sinsa Station will be placed to the right. Seo Hyung-seok, reporter of skytree 08 a.m. donga.com There are two beverage machines on the wall of Seoul subway line, Nonhyeon Station, and Bupyeong-gu Office Station, on B1F. Right next to it is a pair of green iron doors that are the size of two vending machines. As the stationmaster Cho Moon-ok pushed the door, a completely different air was thrown at him. The dust blew through the open door and pricked my nose. One step and a dark, deep silence. It wouldn't be strange for anything more than to come forward. The stationmaster pressed the switch next to the door. An old fluorescent lamp shuddered to the surface. The space spread out. Hundreds of people could have walked in and out. Walking about 20 meters and turning right, the undetached slope was revealed. Unfinished concrete columns line the middle. The phone signal was cut off. When you illuminate a section 25m below the slope with a flashlight, you can see a long and wide space. If you place a track on either side, it is an endless subway station. "" This is not a place in the station's guidance map, "" Cho said. It is Nonhyeon Station's platform, the subway line 11, which has been sleeping underground for 16 years in Gangnam Boulevard. There are five "" ghost stations "" in Seoul that are not accessible to ordinary passengers. The station was closed to the public for 43 years and opened to the public in October this year. The total area is approximately 5257 m ² (excluding Shinseol-dong Station and approximately 1,500 pyeong). Four stations, excluding Sinseol-dong Station, were required to transfer to subway stations in the 3rd (Line 9-12 and Line 3 extensions) during construction of Subway Line No. 5-8 from 1996 to 2002. I thought that if I built the third route structure in advance, I could save money and design transit facilities to be convenient for passengers. An official of the Seoul Transportation Corporation explained, "" When the second line opened, many people pointed out that it was inconvenient because of the long transfer distance between the first and fourth lines. ""The third line was opened in 1999, if not canceled the following year due to the 1997 financial crisis. At least, the transfer stations made when building Yeouido Station (Line 5), Ogeum Station (Line 9, Yeouido Station), and Garak Market Station (Line 5 and extension 3) were made were shown. That is why the transfer distances of these stations are short. Since the four ghost stations were built 20 years ago, even the station employees often do not exist. We can see such a ' alternate platform ' after the station is assigned to it, said Moon Jong-hyeon, a Seoul Transportation Corporation official at Yeongdeungpo Market Station on subway line 5. As subway plans changed, so did the fate of the ghost stations.Line 10 transit route construction on the basement level of Yeongdeungpo Market Station, Subway Line 5, Seoul Station and Seoksu Station (Seoksu Station ~ Seoksu Station) were originally connected to Line 10 in 1998. Seo Hyeong-seok, a reporter at Nonhyeon Station, will replace Line 11 as the new section line that opens in 2022. As the Yeongdeungpo Station and Sindang Station are not planning to replace the aborted Line 10, no one knows when they will get out of the ghost town. The Shin-Sansan Line will be placed instead of Line 10, but the transfer location will be different. There are no immediate plans to utilize it. Ghost stations are currently regularly checked, maintained and maintained by the Seoul Transportation Authority. Rep. Kim Seong-tae of the Freedom Party, a parliamentary committee on land and transportation, said, We need to discuss how to utilize the large underground space in downtown Seoul. We need to think about ways to use public services while being efficient, such as subway workers ` resting areas, lost property centers and exhibition halls.Seo Hyeong-seok, reporter of The Dong-A Ilbo, The official Facebook page of The Dong-A Ilbo, and the university's college entrance examination method were announced in Seoul on July 12.

"Prosecutors have also tracked down a bank of bribes, drug smuggling, sales, and other criminal activity enforcement agencies in Suwon District Public Prosecutors ' Office.

Drugs hidden in the steps by social networking site drug dealers exposed by the Suwon District Prosecutors ' Office. In addition, many social network operators of the drug market are expensively bought and sold at high prices. Prosecutors explain that the price of black market meth is sold at 400,000 won per gram, and is estimated to be around one million won per gram. The main culprit in the foreign community is posting slang words meaning "" drugs "" on social networking sites and receiving money with virtual currency such as cannon accounts or Bitcons from those who contacted him. Then, buyers were sent photos of the location where the drug was hidden and visited. They hid the drugs in the public restrooms in gaps behind the toilet, under the stairwells, under the fire extinguisher stand, and between windows. The crime profile of a group of methamphetamines sold via social networking sites. The offenders committed the crime by thoroughly dividing the roles of drug dealers, account managers, and distributors. The main culprits was the recruitment of buyers and sellers via social networking sites. When a trestler took drugs to Korea under the guise of an international mail, the handman covered them up in small portions and hid them in various places. Then, they took pictures of the hiding places and sent them to the main culprits overseas. They operated their organizations in a thoroughly organized form of organization, such as by calling social networking sites to ensure that they could not share their identities or roles. Drugs that social networking sites were caught by the Department of Strength at Suwon District Public Prosecutors ' Office and hidden under fire extinguishers, making it easy for them to find out whether or not they are dealing with people who sell drugs, and for whom they can sell, prosecutors say. Prosecutors arrested the criminals living abroad by making fake transactions and tracing their accounts after selecting their social networking site IDs through Internet monitoring. It also worked with Interpol to keep other criminals abroad. Among them, D, 37, the main culprit of the Vietnam organization, was confirmed to have died last October of excessive drug use. Police also say they and prosecutors are investigating 1,000 people who purchased drugs from the organizations.

Jeon and Kim, who are in the middle of the East and West, were charged with fishing at 6:02 a.m. when they collided with a fishing boat pier 1.25 kilometers southwest of Jindung Island in Incheon. The pier, which was overturned after the collision, had 22 people on board at the time of the accident. Seven others, including three fishermen who survived the air pocket (the air pocket) for two hours and 43 minutes, were rescued by the Coast Guard. The Korea Coast Guard judged that Jeon neglected her duty because she did not decelerate to prevent a collision or changed her route even after discovering the fishing boat before the accident. "" At 6:12 a.m. that day, the distance between the two vessels was about 300 meters, "" a Coast Guard official said. "" We could not avoid the collision if we sailed (continued) in that condition. "" Jeon checked the fishing boat before the collision and I knew it would be avoided, but [I didn't see any sign on deck] when I checked the location of the boat's crew member."" 15 People Dead "" Youngheungdo accident ... A tanker - both fishing and fishing boat, he checked into a diner to drink water during the accident. Kim admitted to the charge of leaving the cockpit, although the tanker did not know what was going on in the accident when it went to a restaurant four minutes before it passed through Yeongheung Bridge. The time of the accident was revised from 6:05 a.m. on July 3 to 6:02 p.m. at the Coast Guard's investigation briefing on Tuesday. The Korea Coast Guard considered the first report to be filed at 6:05 a.m. at a news briefing, but decided when the accident would occur based on the ship's track chart analysis. The Coast Guard estimated the speed of the tanker at a speed of 12.3 to 12.5 knots (22.7-23.1 km/h) from 6.35 a.m. on the third day before the accident, but made a near constant change of speed at 6:45 a.m. - The ship's captain, Jeon, who is licensed as a fifth-class sailor, reportedly operated the ship for 6-11 months without any problems with the conditions of her flight. However, it was confirmed that in April this year, he crashed into a Chinese cargo ship. The fishing boat captain Oh, who had operated the first pier since October 2015, also had a small pilot's license and had no problems with the conditions of his flight. It was confirmed that the oil tanker owner Lee was on a deck crew together when the accident occurred. "" We are taking it very seriously to the point that we have made a number of immature actions in the process of handling the incident, "" said a Coast Guard official. Until now, official conversations were only exchanged in English. Suddenly, an article was posted that seemed to mock the bit coin investors in Korean. BTP is a cipher coin (a virtual coin) that has come out of a bit coin. A hard fork is a software upgrade. Using a hard fork, the speed of payment by password is improved. If the consensus among the participants in the encrypted currency ecosystem is not reached during this process, new encryption holes may be dropped. Bitcone Cache that dropped from Bitcone last August is representative. Originally, the creation of new cipher currency was viewed as a negative factor because participants ' trust in the money, the underlying value of supporting cipher strengths, was damaged. However, the price of the bit coin increased after the bit-coining cache became hard fork, and the bit-coined cache became a bonus for investors. Soon the hard fork was considered a ' crypto-dividend '. [Graphic : journalist Park Kyung-min] This month, several bit-coined hard forks were scheduled to be installed. This is the main reason why Bitcone has raised its price to 24 million won with the launch of Bit-coin futures. If you have a bit coin on a BTP hard fork scheduled for the 10th, you can get the same amount of BTP. Given the precedent of Bitcone Cache, it means an additional profit of one million won can be earned at the outside. Shortly before the hard fork, however, the BTP's official Twitter post read, "" We play the hard fork because of a technical error. "" As investors asked what happened in English, the answers suddenly appeared in Korean. Investors identified the posts by tracing their IP addresses. She was currently in high school as A (18). The sale price of BTP fraud has earned him 5 million won at the loading dock, the official said. As the purchase tax is on the brink of being disbursed from BTP hard forks, the price of Bitcoin is on the rise, meaning that they made money by selling Bit-coins and lowering the price by acting hard forks. "" It is my fault that I have invested in this, "" he said to protesting investors. However, those who claim to be BTP developers posted an explanation on an official Twitter account on July 11. BTP is not a scam, they never post such an article, and the hard forks move on as planned. On July 12, A requested police to protect their lives, and the Gangnam Police Station in Seoul announced that it is protecting their lives. Police gave the soldier a Smart Watch to protect his personal life. So far, it is a mystery what is true. However, this incident revealed the weakness of encrypted money. There is virtually no crypto-money investment information or reports. Institutional financial institutions or research institutes do not publish reports. That is why most crypto-money investors rely on unconfirmed information from personal blogs or related cafes. Since there are no rules to penalize such price manipulation, it is often done through Kakao Talk or Telegram chat rooms. Some criticize that the exchange, which has little choice but to provide accurate information for investors, decided to pay out crypto-money bills like BTP without proper verification. Earlier, some local exchanges announced they would provide BTP's to owners of bit coins at the time of BTP hard forks. Shin Won-hee, chief operating officer, who did not disclose its position of BTP among major exchanges, said, `` It is easy for investors to criticize the exchange for making a decision on whether to pay the hard fork in the first place, '' adding, `` It is easy for the exchange investors to make a decision. '' There is no regulation to punish the "" A "" soldier for cheating. This is because in the first place, Bitcone had no legal status, such as currency or financial instruments. Left in the blind spot of regulation. Since they are outside the drawing control, they can avoid doing business by themselves. Since the exchange is merely a communication seller status that can be established with only 45,000 won per district, there is no need to provide financial companies with security or protection for investors. There is no way for investors to find the money when they run overseas with the client bit coin, said an official at the Korea Cryptocode Exchange. One crypto-money expert, who declined to be named, said, "" Cryptograph is not guaranteed value by the central institution ; it is value derived from the trust of the participants and there is no mechanism to determine "" and "" the truth to protect investors.

Hundreds of articles are posted every day at virtual money-related Internet cafes, proving the craze. When a person who makes money from a sudden increase in Bitcone, they invest in virtual currency one after another, from housewives to students, and crimes against it are also rampant. Due to the nature of virtual currency transactions anonymously exchanged between users through P2P (personal transactions) technology without the control of issuing agencies, it is difficult for investigators to trace money even when it is misused in crimes. Some say that the speculative boom and crime-related news should be causing the virtual currency market to get bruised, and that the government should take proper measures to regulate it.[Figure : Cho Hae-in] Virtual coin market, in which investment is bruised ... As the price of beatcoins has soared due to crimes such as fraud and conversion, students and housewives are rushing into the virtual currency market. Office worker A was surprised to hear that his wife, a stay-at-home mom, invested 2 million won at home and made a profit in just a few days. "" My wife bought some bit coins after watching the news, and when I said, "" I made a sudden leap from the good news, "" she said, "" I earned a hard fork and listing on the U.S. Futures Exchange, "" adding, "" I sat down more than 3 million won every day for a month. Even middle and high school students are investing. A message posted in an Internet community said, "" Students and investors open Kakao Talk Open chat rooms to share information. "" I can read books, read books, know how to look at the future, the publisher said. High school students are also known to be at the center of the recent controversy surrounding Bitcone platinum. Bitcone platinum abruptly announced yesterday that it would delay the production of a new virtual currency separating it. It was followed by a comment on the Bitcone Platinum Twitter account that made fun of investors in the tone of middle and high school students. Netizens tracked the developer of Bitcone platinum and named a high school student as the lead. One social networking service account that she described as a high school student said, "" If I earned about 3 million won from Bitcone, it's not just my fault that I was the only one who hurt it. "" Gangnam Police Station said on July 12, "" We gave Smart Watch to a controversial student on the Internet who asked for his personal protection. "" Schools and residential areas of students were also better policed and guarded. In addition, singer Park Jeong-un (52) was involved in a pyramid scheme to return profits to virtual currency when he invested in a virtual machine. It was also confirmed that the exchange rate (illegal foreign exchange transaction), which is based on the "" bit coin "" method, increased. The expectation that it will be easy to make money despite such news is not enough to stop the speculative fever. "" It is not easy to say that middle aged people made a lot of money out of real estate, but because we have less capital and we have a lot of real estate regulations, it is not easy to jump in. "" Most are written by Danta, who repeatedly say ' joy ' and ' sigh ' over price fluctuations, but some are also outstanding analysts on the nation's top class of virtual money-related foreign news and block chains. Since news directly connected to price fluctuations is not widely heard here, many users translate it to share. One office worker who frequently uses cafes said, "" I read the new directions dozens of times a day via a virtual cash-related cafe because I don't have much news about virtual currencies with local news. "" A businessman, identified by his surname C, first started investing when he heard about virtual money from an acquaintance of an investigator. The acquaintance found out the truth of the block chain during the fake virtual money investment scam, and because of the investigation, he decided to study it inevitably and invested 50 million won in loans as he found it worthwhile to invest. When I heard that my acquaintances spent 50 million won on the project earlier this year and were called about 800 million won in June, I made quite a bit of a dive in July and September, said C. `` There's a lot of news about virtual currency regulations lately, and regulation is not the best, '' he said, adding, `` Like countries in the Middle East, having a lot of virtual money makes Korea a future asset. ''[AFP : Combined news reports]....The U.S. government controls the trade embargo against U.S. ... Where is Korea? Each country has announced a different virtual currency market this year. First, China declared the disclosure of new currency illegal last September. China's three major virtual currency exchanges have also reportedly stopped, with pressure coming from authorities. Indonesia and Russia have also banned virtual currency transactions altogether. On the other hand, the United States and Japan are trying to regulate virtual currency by recognizing some. In Japan, a bill to recognize it as a legal payment method was passed in April, and the U.S. allowed the U.S. to make a coin futures transaction with the Chicago Options Exchange (CBOE) and the Chicago Board of Trade. Under these circumstances, Korean regulators have been divided over how to proceed. Experts point out that it is not best to simply ban transactions altogether because they are not tied to certain monetary authorities. As China controlled the virtual currency transactions, many Chinese investors moved to Korea, explained Hwang Soo-young, I don`t have to say that a country would ban transactions.

"The Financial Services Commission (FSC), a three-sector mortgage loan regulation set, and the government should build an additional 1450-1460 trillion won in bank loans to cover mortgage loans with high LTV ratios. The figure is an 8.7 to 8.8 percent increase from 134.5268 trillion won at the end of last year. Although the growth rate slightly slowed from 10.9 % in 2015 and 11.6 % in 2016, it is still higher than before. The government, which has issued a series of measures to cope with the June 19 real estate policy, August 2 real estate policy and October 24 household debt crisis, this year and a soft landing of household loans to catch up with demand. That is what we call the "" Group of Three Capital Regulations. "" Instead of curbing the demand for loans, such as the debt-to-equity ratio (DTI) and the mortgage-accreditation ratio (LTV), the bank will tighten its capital regulations to reduce the supply of household loans. Choi Jong-koo, chairman of the Financial Services Commission, told reporters at the year-end seminar on July 11, "" The government is preparing improvements to the financial sector's capital regulations. Choi said, We will strengthen capital regulations on mortgage loans with high LTV and apply a differentiated weight on household loans and corporate loans when calculating the bank's loan-deposit rates. This means that the government will introduce stronger regulations that cover all of the capital regulations that it has been reviewing so far. [Graphic : Lee Jeong-kwon, journalist of the Korea Institute of Standards and Technology, gaga@joongang.co.kr] and Chairman Choi Jung-soo said, "" There are three main regulations on capital. First, it significantly increases the risk weight, which is currently between 30 % and 40 %, when calculating the ratio of equity capital of the International Bank for Settlement (BIS) only for housing mortgage loans. Then banks will have to cut down on high- goV home mortgages to keep BIS rates from dropping. Daishin Securities Research Institute Choi Jeong-wook explained, For banks, the removal of the assets of the high- goV loans is advantageous, so it would encourage them to pay off existing loans. As a result, mortgage loans with more than 70 percent of existing LTV received could be difficult to extend their maturity. Regulations on lending and deposit rates will be tightened. The loan-deposit rate is the ratio of the won-won loan to the won-pre-designation rate. Banks should manage the loans within 100 percent. Currently, household and corporate loans are equally reflected in the loans. However, the government decided to reflect the high value of household loans and the low weight of corporate loans in the future. Banks with large household loans have two options. One is to reduce household loans and increase corporate loans, while the other is to collect and meet the regulations by collecting deposits and leaving household loans intact. Although the government is keen to reduce household loans, it could actually result in banks raising deposit rates to increase deposit size, said Lee Byung-gun, a banking research fellow at the DBI. A new sector block of counter-budget capital is introduced. Of all the loans made by banks, the bank allows them to accumulate more capital as a proportion of their household loans. Until now, there has been a basis for imposing the counter-bullying buffer capital that allows households to make loans regardless of their household or business loans, but it has never actually built up (0 percent). The three types of capital regulations are strict regulations that restrain the supply of household loans and profitability for banks. The effect on the household loan market will be no less on the new-government DTI (current DTI) or debt-to-future ratio (DSR) that financial authorities plan to introduce next year sequentially. For consumers, the loan will face a higher threshold when lending rates are already on the rise. That means the government takes household debt issues seriously. Lee Byung-yoon, an economist at the Korea Institute of Finance, said, We have come up with a series of household debt measures so far, but our expectations of economic players have not changed significantly, securing the soundness of the banks and securing the policies for the government. In fact, the Seoul housing market, which had declined right after the Aug. 2 real estate measure, has changed its stance 180 degrees since the middle of last month. Apartment prices are on the rise again. The 84-square-square ㎡ exclusive of Raemian Daechi Palace in southern Seoul was traded at 2,040 million won earlier this month, an increase of 100 million won. The auction market is also heating up. According to Auction-Information firm Jiwoo Auction, the auction price of three apartments in Gangnam last month was 107 percent, the highest since January 2001.

Since the revision eliminates restrictions on the scope of government support, businesses can receive 81000 won, or 90 percent of their pension insurance premiums,. The remaining 9000 won is paid by the workers and users only 4,500 won each.In addition, the revision excluded workers who took time off or shortened working hours due to birth or childcare when calculating the number of workers at businesses with less than 10 who are eligible for pension insurance.

Similar receiving or call-to-money transactions will result in a jail term of less than 10 years or a fine of 500 million won. Under the current law, the penalty criteria for violations were "" jail terms of five years or fines of less than 50 million won.

It is the first time that the Fair Trade Commission has imposed fines on companies for forced purchase and for expensive sales. According to the commission, Mr. Kim, a gimbap franchiser, kept 18 items free of forced sales, including washing, sterilizing agents, food containers, sanitary masks, and disposable spoons, to maintain the consistency of prices. Though Kim can provide 18 items cheaper than the market price through mass purchase, it has been confirmed that he sold them at higher prices. Hygiene masks were 42 percent over-profitable, providing stores in the online shopping mall with a minimum purchase price of 37,700 won. The franchise business law, which in principle prohibits the owners of a store from unfairly dealing with a particular person, only permits the item as an exception and allows it to maintain its consistency. The fact that the headquarters is profiteering from forcing the purchase under the name of the essential item is chronic, and Kim Sang-jo, chairman of the Fair Trade Commission, stressed the need for improvement in measures to normalize the franchise business.Fair Trade Commission Chairman Kim Sang-jo speaks with leaders of related associations at a meeting of Fair Trade Commission Chairman and Distribution Industry held at the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry in central Seoul Friday. Kim Seong-gwang, a reporter at Daeda University in Seoul, failed to provide 194 subscribers with information on the status of nearby franchises despite having to provide them in writing to potential subscribers. In addition, the contract was signed even though it was not after the 14-day grace period after the disclosure. The commission is worried that the government might raise awareness of the possibility of increasing the profits of restaurant owners as some food and restaurants have recently forced owners to purchase items unrelated to brand consistency.

It was $ 169.99 from Amazon and 1,852,000 from Korean money. In addition, they ordered the latest TV products for 2.1 million won, including duties. The lowest Internet price in Korea is 2.7 million won. As fast ball players become more popular, we can buy premium products more cheaply, Kim said.As Internet shopping has become more popular since 2010 and the number of non-party fastballs has soared, consumers are now living in an era of comparing and choosing prices around the world, even if they buy the same product. Especially, as the U.S. has a lower sales price than Korea, and as major discount events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday overlap, more and more consumers are purchasing home appliances using non-loading factories in the U.S.Then, why is the price of the same product cheaper? Manufacturers explain that the market is the largest, with its labor costs being low, selling products at overseas production bases and fierce competition, and therefore the price of rice is higher than that of Korea. However, the complaint of reverse discrimination by domestic consumers does not go away.When electronic industry officials talk together on July 11, the price difference between Korean and American models is the biggest reason why they differ in price, including labor. All of the products for domestic use by Samsung and LG are produced at local sites. But most of the products sold in the United States are made in Mexico, where labor is cheaper. That is, there is a difference between ' Made in Korea ' and ' Made in Mexico ' even for the same product. In addition to Samsung and LG products, popular products for direct customers, British products such as Dyson cleaner and Shaomi from China are much cheaper than their Korean counterparts. U.S. Amazon's retail price is about 700,000 won cheaper than Korean Internet shopping malls, 420,000 won for Samsung's 65-inch TV set, and 280 thousand won cheaper for Dyson's wireless cleaner.The European fast ball prices, especially in Germany and the U.K., are lagging behind those in Korea, but the reason why U.S. selling prices are so cheap is because of the nature of the market. For example, the U.S. market is about 20 times larger than Korea's on TV. Because sales are higher than in Korea, the fixed costs themselves are cheaper. It is explained that "" economies of scale "" are possible. In the case of U.S. market, the competition is so fierce that it is literally an arbitrage to the fourth quarter, said an official of an electronics giant, including Black Friday, to dump inventory.Even with a fast ball, it is advantageous to buy the same model that is sold in Korea. In case of fast ball products, after-service (A-S) is often a nuisance. Any other model shall be difficult or should be long overdue for repair in the event of a component failure. It is better to choose a model that will be sold in Korea for long-term use than locally specialized products because it is slightly cheaper, said an official at an electronics company.Samsung and LG provide after-service services based on the U.S. even if they buy products with a fast ball at shopping malls such as Amazon and eBay. The U.S. sales TV panel is guaranteed one year, but you can get one year of service here even with a fast ball. A ' Chargeback Service ' that can cancel an approved transaction in writing within 120 days of the credit card payment date (statement receipt date) in preparation for any post-payment interruption or refund can also be requested to the credit card company."
"② News 1 Designer Bang Eun-young (Seoul = News 1) = U.S. reporter Park Hyung-ki made his debut on October 10 (local time) at the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE). On the first day of trading, the bit-coined futures rose 24 percent to $ 18,100. That is 13 percent higher than spot prices. In general, it is normal that the gift price is slightly higher than the spot price. Gifts are usually slightly higher than in kind, as interest and holding costs are required.However, it is abnormal to know that futures prices are 13 percent higher than they are in kind. In this case, in theory, it would be possible to make a 13 % profit right away if a bit coin were bought in the spot market and sold to the futures market.Of course, since it is the beginning of the transaction, the price is not yet stable. Experts generally believe that the price will decrease if the transaction continues. Still, it is also true that there is too much difference between gifts and goods. Once the present price is higher than the present price, it is more likely that the bit coin spot will also increase.But there is a more important element. Beatcoins are not official coins. Still, many experts doubt the value and function of storage. Now it is in the $ 17,000 per cone, but it could turn into a ' zero ' dollar at any moment. Therefore, I am interested in the Bitcone Market, and the gift market is the way to participate in the Bitcone Market without having to buy a risky beat coin myself. When you pay in kind, you receive a bit coin. However, when you pay for a bit coin in the futures market, you receive cash. The value of the bit coin is not decided yet. If the bit coin is devalued, it becomes a meaningless virtual call. However, the futures market can get cash even if it is undervalued. In other words, they can make investment related to Bitcone without investing directly in a risky bit coin. Some experts analyzed that the present price is significantly higher than the actual price due to the safety premium attached to the gift.There is no reason why individual investors should refuse to invest in BitTone. Meanwhile, institutional investors have been avoiding investment because of safety reasons. However, CBOE is not a private exchange but is a government-approved exchange. As a result, experts say that many institutional investors are likely to enter the Bitcone futures market.In addition, securities firms ETF (Index-linked Fund), which is linked to futures prices, are also expected to appear soon. Two asset management firms in the U.S. have already requested the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a license to release the ETF based Bitcone. Rekshaus LLC and Van Eck Associates asked the U.S. SEC for a license to release Bitcone ETF on July 11.Sinopark @ One resident who came to find the bag was checking the situation when asked to withdraw the money since they did not have 90,000 won in the bag. The criminal on the screen was their colleague, Lieutenant A, who worked with them.The situation was as follows. Earlier, a town bus driver visited the police box to find the owner of the bus because the passengers had left their things on it. Inspector A was then the one who received and kept the handbag. He slid 90,000 won in the bag and put it in his pocket while his colleagues were working on something else. As his colleague approached him, the screen showed him taking care of things on his desk by pretending to do something else.According to police, Inspector A also violated the procedure for handling lost articles. It was revealed that even if the lost articles were returned to their owners immediately, they had to register with the comprehensive management system and then issue a report of the found items to be found, but all such procedures had been omitted.When the crime was committed, Inspector A pleaded for leniency, saying, It was accidental, not intentional, stealing. However, the police dismissed him and even accused him. Eventually, he was sentenced to one million won in fines.A policeman who has received prizes 23 times, including a citation for police chief and a regional chief, is blinded by 90,000 won and is reduced to a criminal.The prosecutor A raised an objection to the commission, explained, "" It is too much punishment, "" and received a reduction in punishment, and filed a suit with the Seoul Administrative Court to cancel the disciplinary action. Police said, "" The theft of Inspector A's lost property was a breach of duty as a police officer and can not be justified by any excuse.

"When the second passenger terminal opens on January 18 next year, the era of two terminals will open at Incheon International Airport. If the users of Korean Air and Delta Airlines are distributed to Terminal 2, the congestion at existing Terminal 1 will decrease, and so on.Korean Air held a press release ceremony on July 12, about a month before the opening of its second terminal at Incheon International Airport. The terminal 2 was busy in last-minute arrangements to greet passengers.Incheon International Airport will host the second terminal for the Sky Team with four airlines - Korean Air, Delta Air, Air France and KLM - inside. Customers using these four airlines therefore will have to go to the second passenger terminal from January 18 next year rather than the existing first passenger terminal.Korean Air is moving to Terminal 2, and the counter of its first passenger terminal has also changed. Asiana Airlines on the west side of the terminal is currently scheduled to move to the east of Korean Air and 40 foreign airlines, including Singapore Airlines at Seung-dong, will use terminal 1, Jeju Air, and Jin-ea Airlines at lower cost 13.The second terminal had a smaller airport area (380,000 ㎡) than the first terminal, and the arrival area and duty-free shop were designed centrally to make the airport easier to use.It is expected that the departure procedures and departure procedures will be quicker and more convenient than anything else in the form of the second passenger terminal. Upon arrival at the 2nd Transportation Center via the Airport Railroad, it will take less than five minutes to walk to Terminal 2. The distance between the transportation center and terminal No. 1 was 223 meters, while that of terminal No. 2 was reduced to 59 meters.Automatic ticket issuance (self-checking), in which passengers can get their tickets issued directly without waiting at the check-in counter, and automatic baggage consignment (self-locking) service have also expanded. There are 62 self-checked kiosks installed at terminal 2. There are also 34 self-back drop devices installed. I had a hunch that the airport's long line of visitors would completely change its scenery.It also reduces the time needed to search for security. As explosives, which had not been detected by traditional metal detectors are now available through the 24 prototype scanners, the flow of passengers will be faster as security guards do not have to search by themselves. A variety of sophisticated devices have been introduced to minimize the wait time for passengers, including the use of baggage handling system and customs mobile reports. Incheon International Airport Corp. expects the departure time of the second terminal to be cut by an average of 20 minutes compared to the first.However, confusion among early passengers is also feared since terminal two is far from terminal one and all flights ' gates are changed.If you visit a terminal incorrectly, you can take a shuttle bus between the two terminals, but it is important to check the terminal correctly before using the airport because it takes more than 30 minutes to travel. More care is needed when using the Korean Air codeliver, as the terminal locations of the two airlines are different.The door to Business Pastrack, terminal 2, has not yet been licensed, is firmly closed.Korean Air plans to operate check-in counters at terminal 1 in the early stage of the opening for the wrong passengers. The Open Business Pastrack is still a homework to solve. Korean Air has installed a fastrack facility at its terminal that allows perst-class passengers to immediately receive premium check-in services, but the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport has not approved it for creating a sense of incompatibility.Korean Air Vice President Woo Ki-hong said, If joint ventures with Delta Airlines are implemented early next year, Korean Air may soon be able to solve the problem of developing the terminal into a hub linking Asia and America.Gefangene notice filed … transport and information 1 © news 委 held (= 1 News, Seoul, Korea) Jung Eunji Journalist : a explosion events in Japan, Korean identified only by his family name Jeon was taken into custody in Japan.That the allegations were made by the unfair treatment from domestic feed that pushing for his government announced on October 12.

The National Human Rights Commission of Korea made the announcement at a debate on the human rights situation of contract workers in the public sector held at the NHRC in central Seoul on July 12. The weapons contracts are secretaries, investigators, officials, telephone exchanges, nutritionists, agents, safety and librarians. The commission requested the Korea Labor Relations Research Center to analyze the effects of employment security, pay, and advancement opportunities after converting public sector workers to weapons contracts, and the gap in human rights conditions between regular and full-time employees. As a result, the number of weapons contract workers in the public sector rose to 203,7317 in 2016 from 133,562 in 2012, according to a survey. As of last year, the number of contract workers for weapons in the public sector amounted to 203,317. By type, the number of institutions was 8231, that of local governments, 42,702, 22,356, 10,579 of provincial state-run firms, and 113,279 of education institutions. The central government agencies saw an increase of 150.2 percent, increasing by 10,944. Public institutions saw their weapons contracts grow 98.7 percent (16,844). This is a good example of the government's ongoing policy of shifting long-term workers to non-contractory contract. Meanwhile, the average monthly wage of contract workers was 2.71 million won, or 61 percent of that of regular workers. It is slightly higher than the wage of regular workers, who account for only 47 percent of full-time workers, but only slightly more than half of full-time workers. For example, telephone operators, nutritionists at the central government agencies, operators of computer operators, and education institutes receive about 50 % of wage when compared to regular employees. In addition, among 13 benefits items that apply to regular workers, only four of them were applied to armed contract workers. The amount of money paid on holidays bonuses was 50-60 % of that paid on regular workers. In addition, about 59 % of contract arms-related workers had identical or similar jobs in their workplaces, and only 1.2 % of wage earners and career advancement rates were consolidated to 1.2 %. Most of the employees have separate manpower management systems. Other were even excluded due to dinners and contract labor. Due to such structural problems, contract workers have not improved their employment security by showing similar levels of dissatisfaction with their counterparts in terms of wages, benefits, labor intensity and career development opportunities. Jeong Heung-jun, policy researcher at the Korea Institute of Non-Specific Labor, said, "" In the case of the public sector, we created a new work group, such as contract with weapons, "" adding, "" It is difficult to integrate non-regular workers into the complicated field as full-time workers. But they have been criticized for being full-time, as they are highly differentiated from regular workers, and have been criticized as ` middle and high ranking officials `. We will discuss with experts and related ministries the conditions of working conditions and discriminatory treatment that were found during the period of the weapons contract changes that were confirmed in the current survey, and prepare measures to improve the situation in the future, said a commission official. pjh@newsis.com> Graphic.A.F.

Heat rose from drain or manhole covers all over the road and blew out the white breath. Winter migratory birds including cranes and wild geese also cowered in their beds at the Han River. In Incheon, more and more citizens used their cars to park their cars on the streets of Seoul's outer circle, the first and second Gyeongin Expressway, and the access road to the industrial complex were caused by unusual traffic congestion. People lined up at the bus stop in front of Suwon Station, curled up and rolled around in front of the cold. Some of the shoes even had boots cold, but were still cold enough to withstand the biting cold.Pedestrians rush to and from one street in western Daejeon Wednesday.

As the conflict continues between the two companies, the organizing committee of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics decided to ask the employers to resolve the problems as soon as possible and to push for a consultative meeting between the three telecom companies to prevent the recurrence of the incident. According to the mobile industry on July 12, SK Telecom has not removed all of the optical cables installed at KT's inner room around Pyeongchang from the area from September and October. The section is 3.3 kilometers from the golf course of Alpensia 700 GC inlet (Samgeori) to the concert hall. This section is the only one besides the International Broadcasting Center (IBC), which has already been dismantled out of the three sections KT complained about illegally installing. KT filed a lawsuit against SK Telecom and its four employees at the Chuncheon District Public Prosecutors ` Office at the end of November for illegally installing optical cables inside their communication lines. At the time, KT sued LG U-Plus for the same thing, but LG U-Plus had already restored the problem. SK Telecom, however, only removed the optical cable installed inside the IBC in front of the three sections after the contents were revealed on July 4. SK Telecom argues that the rest of the Alpensia Ski Jumping Center should not be torn down because it is not unauthorized. The cable was approved and installed by the Gangwon Development Corporation, the owner of the pipeline through the inner pipe, and was approved by KT. SK Telecom sent a certificate to KT on July 8 requesting that any unauthorized installation claims should stop the distorted acts as they constitute defamation and innocence. KT, on the other hand, said, "" Separate from the conduit line, the inner tube is its new installation for the Olympics, so it requires approval and has never agreed. "" The organizing committee believes that the cable should be removed without the approval of the owner of the inner pipe, but that the issue should be settled after consultations between the two companies. Regarding this, the organizing committee sent an official letter to the three telecom companies on July 7, saying, Some operators have damaged or taken control of third-party communications firms, prompting them to ask for a quick fix on the ongoing dispute over information and communication services. In addition, 48 sites for major communication networks, including Gangneung Olympic Park and Pyeongchang Sports Park, will be surveyed with the three companies on June 6-7 and discussion will be carried out through three major consultative bodies to prevent their recurrence. It is difficult to intervene forcibly because it is up to the discussion between the two companies, said an organizing committee official. okko@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"Biochronic breakdown helps night and rest, calls for autonomous nerves, hormone, scrambled fatigue and lethargy, and the use of artificial light in the night, however, the use of natural light during the night should be justified by the day. [Central Photo] It has been claimed that prolonged use of smartphones and tablet PCs at night causes anger control disorders, mood control disorders such as bipolar disorder and depression. Lee Heon-jung, a professor of psychiatry at High Scale Angae Hospital, warned on July 11 at the "" Light Pollution, Disturb of Life and Health in Modern Times "" symposium organized by the Korean Medical Association and Korean Bar Association. The artificial light from smartphones and tablet PCs breaks the biological rhythms and causes paralysis and depression, said Lee, saying, If abnormal rhythms are repeated, it could worsen as a disease. The blue light of smartphones affects the brain and disturbs the biological rhythms. Biochronic is a kind of clock that allows the body to wake up and rest in a stable state during the day and at night. Hormones are released to aid activity and relaxation, and the autonomic nervous system converts each time. Under normal biological rhythms, the function of body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, mood, and urine production begins to drop at 10 p.m. and the next morning, the lowest point is taken. Since then, the hormone cortisol, which wakes the body, is the most popular hormone at 6 a.m. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with emotional control and happiness, is mostly released during the day. Core temperature drops most at 2 a.m. Professor Lee Heon-jung : Cortisol secretion is highest at 6 a.m. Professor Lee Heon-jung : Feeling is most relaxed at 2 a.m. Professor Lee Heon-jung, along with Professor Cho Chul-hyun of the same department, received an 8:00-12:10:00 lux of light at night last year for 25 adult males. After that, oral epithelium cells were collected every four hours to grade dysphoria, and biorrhythmia was delayed by four hours. All 25 men complained of lethargy, fatigue and insomnia. The biorhythm and environment were not the same, so they experienced a kind of parallax. When exposed to the light at night using a smartphone or tablet PC, the body is under the illusion that it is still daytime. As hormone secretion during the day and night is complicated, it becomes difficult to control emotions and causes fatigue and depression the next day. Smartphones give a strong stimulus to the brain because they emit artificial light right in front of the eyes, Professor Lee Heon-jung said, "" They disturb the biological rhythms more aggressively than watching TV from afar. "" The symposium warned of more harmful effects on teenagers. Teens are more sensitive to the artificial light exposed at night. Children with more than three hours of night smartphone use tend to become overly active and impulsive when they lack sleep, said Jung Young-chul, a professor of mental health at Severance Hospital. Studies show that the use of smartphones, which affect the biological rhythms of teenagers, has become shorter than an hour recently, Chung said. Chung cited a study released in Japan two months ago. When comparing the group of boys who used smartphones for 30 minutes and those who spent 1 hour and 40 minutes, the autonomic nervous system became more agitated in the morning in the group that used smartphones for an extended time. Increased heart rate and increased blood pressure can cause stress and body tension. To reduce the disturbance of the biological rhythm of artificial light, it is advisable to enjoy plenty of sunshine during the day. Professor Lee Heon-jung said, The problem with light pollution is that we see too little light during the day, whereas we see a lot of light at night. Jamie Zeiser, a medical professor at Stanford University in the U.S. who attended the symposium on Friday, said Strong daylight during the day means that it is less likely to affect the level of exposure to artificial light at night. The body becomes less sensitive because natural light is much more intense than artificial light. In the daytime, although it is cloudy, the brightness of light reaches about 10,000 lux. Much stronger than normal indoor lighting (250 to 300 lux). A good deal of daylight during the day can help prevent the biorhythm from becoming damaged when exposed to artificial light at night. If you can't see the sunlight during the day, you'd better lighten up indoors. ShadabRahman, a medical professor at Harvard University in the United States, said, Blue Light helps keep us awake during the day. At night, it is advisable to use a dim house, indirect lighting (e.g., yellow light), and low-blue lighting. Teens should not use smartphones for more than an hour at night.

As polls turn over and over, attention is focused on whether the Republican vegetable garden can be maintained.Although Alabama is traditionally a strong Republican district, it has turned into a prenuptial area after allegations were raised that Republican candidate Roy Moore (70) sexually assaulted a minor in the past. U.S. to Moore, the president candidate Donald Trump, who left the streets during sex scandal supporting fire to change, change is also expected. However, even other Alabama senators are refusing to support any of Mr. Moore's candidates. `` We found the allegations by whistleblowers in the sex scandal reliable, '' Senator Richard Shelby, Alabama Senator, said.Moore's rival, Doug Jones (63), was likely to take over Alabama when allegations of a sexual scandal were raised. However, as pro-conservative supporters continue to unite in the latter part of the election, an unpredictable race is brewing.Whose son of the election is why is it important : Trump will have a significant impact in president's management is an election campaign. Trump about the president's management if the Republicans ' defeat in the party can only increase criticism. Moreover, as the interim elections are scheduled to be held next year, it is of utmost concern whether the president will be able to defend himself or not.Moreover, the Republican Party loses control of the Senate in the Alabama election. The Republican Party currently has 52 seats, and if it loses one, it gives it 51. In this case, when one or two Republicans are opposed, it is hard to pass the bill. Trump the president of the reform of power is naturally no choice but to be.More recently, the Democratic Party is Trump, president of offensive, raising the level and to point out issues such as sexual harassment. The Democratic Party in the Senate, Trump the president's resignation, referring in the House of Representatives impeachment. The party had six Democratic lawmakers in the House of Representatives, Trump tried to impeach the president. At the time, the reasons for impeachment were bigotry and racism.Trump, president for Russian intervention an election scandal and impeachment motion remains, which provide pressure is going to get bigger issue sex scandal. For this reason, for the viscosity is called Trump a 'assessment' for the president working. The main opposition Democratic Party (DP) won the presidential elections in New Jersey and Virginia on July 7. If the Democratic Party wins the interim elections next year, it can make a bet.There are arguments to the contrary. Trump, Trump when Moore's victory that pushes the president, president of Experts also pointed out that will increase the likelihood of impeachment. U.S. Republican political analyst Alex Kastelanos said on July 4 on ABC TV, "" Moor`s victory could be harmful to Republicans. "" He said that when Moore becomes a sort of Republican face, the Republicans could suffer a huge defeat in the interim elections held around the country. "" We are much closer to impeachment than we think, "" Kastelanos said. In the short run, Trump for president as positive, but the long run, Moore could win in the instrument that it can lead to a crushing defeat of the midterm elections.But next year's midterm elections that the Democratic victory in the Trump not lead to the president's impeachment. A victory by the Democratic Party in the interim elections does not guarantee the number of seats needed for impeachment. In the House of Representatives, is for the impeached president, more than two-thirds of the vote in the case of the Senate majority is required. In the interim elections next year, however, only eight of the three Senate districts will have their Republican candidates on active duty. By keeping the Republican Party in place in eight places, the Senate can prevent it from being handed over to the Democratic Party.The Present Situation : In Alabama, different polling agencies have different electoral trends. Some polls say that Jones is leading by 10 percent, while others say that Moore is leading by 9 percent.Regarding the polls ' reversal, the separate L.A. Times explained, "" It is hard to predict who will actually vote. "" Alabama's voting rate is generally 40 to 50 percent, but this election is forecast to be around 25 percent because of the special season. It is the fact that the low voter turnout is a growing prediction of who will actually benefit.An interesting result was a poll of 1559 voters by Survey Monkey. In a poll of people who asked whether they would vote or not, Jones led the poll by 9 percent. However, when surveyed people who actually voted based on their past experience, it was said that Mr. Moore led the poll by three percent. The poll results vary significantly depending on how voters who actually participate in the poll are decided.Monmouth University recently released the poll results based on the turnout. If the voting rate is similar to that of the 2014 election, then Moore is more likely to win. However, it was revealed that when the turnout was high, as it was during the presidential election, Jones was winning. If the voting rate was close to that of the Virginia governor last month, the two candidates were found to be tied.What is more interesting is that the results of the survey differ depending on whether they are interviewed or done mechanically. When interviewed, candidates for the interview were higher, whereas candidates for the investigation were higher when they were being conducted by using a mechanical method such as ARS. Some point out that it is possible to distort the opinion because even the supporters of the candidate do not disclose their candidates due to the sex scandal.Meanwhile, Alabama in the election nationwide attention for Jones, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and former American president, U.S. President Barack Obama of support.The election for the recorded messages for their support. In addition, the main opposition Democratic Party is supporting the battle of Alabama with its next presidential contenders for the presidency en masse. On the contrary, Trump Moore's president recorded message for their support for the election to rally support and effort in '), (守城'.Na Ju-seok, reporter.correspondent gonggam@asiae.co.kr▶ Yang Nak-kyu's "" Military Story """

The audit office of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries held an emergency briefing on July 12 and announced that officials of the Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Ministry have cut down the duration of their special committee activities or consulted with Cheong Wa Dae to make a response to the special committee's action. As suspicion emerged earlier that officials from the salvage promotion team and special team had prevented the special team from operating, the ministry conducted a self-inspection at the instruction of Minister Kim Young-choon in September. As a result of the investigations, some government officials at the ministry were found to have hampered the investigation by the special committee, said Yoo Jae-hyung, an official at the ministry in a briefing. First of all, it was revealed that the date of the special committee's activities on January 1, 2015, which the government insisted on, was set at random, unlike an internal review. The timing of the launch of the special committee was controversial as it was not specified clearly in the previous special law. The Maritime Affairs Ministry's Sewol Recovery Promotion Committee asked six law firms, including law firms, to advise them of the law in February and May 2015, but this was totally unacceptable.The three auditors at the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry had to comment on Feb. 26 of that year, the deadline for naming a special committee, and August 4, when one office was finished. The other two did not reply. Related agencies, the president meeting February 17, three jaegairin teukjjowi the July issue of the legislation but it should look at this time of activities has not accepted either. Furthermore, when the special committee decided to investigate the adequacy of operations related to dealing with disasters against Cheong Wa Dae on November 23 of the same year, the ministry decided to suspend its review of the timing of the activities. As a result, the deadline for special committee activities was reduced to June 30 last year, which resulted in an early termination without proper investigation. In addition, it was confirmed that the controversial document, "" Measures to Countersign the Special Committee on the Sea of Sewol, "" was written by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries on November 19, 2015. In a document then obtained by the media, when the special committee began an investigation into Cheong Wa Dae, all of the ruling party's recommendation committee members resigned en masse and the ruling party committee members issued an abnormal statement. The audit office found the document in a business e-mail used by employees of the Department of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Research and Development in its March issue.We have prepared documents under the top direction and discussed the composition of Cheong Wa Dae Office of National Communication and Marine Fisheries Secretary for Audit and Inspection, said Sewol`s office. The ministry said it will ask prosecutors to investigate the matter of reducing the period of special committee activities and preparing a document to deal with pending issues to disrupt the task of the special team. Yoo said, "" There are around 10 civil servants involved in the incident. "" In addition, the audit office announced that it would be cleared by the prosecution of allegations that the special investigation team dispatched officials led accusations against the bereaved families of the Sewol`s family, and this was confirmed in an additional investigation. Regarding the allegation that the ministry transferred related documents to the National Archives Service to prevent the accident in Sewol`s issue, the records were not disclosed by the Special Committee on September 28 last year. Ryu said, If the second special committee conducts an investigation on other suspicions concerning the salvage of the March issue that was excluded from the investigation as a limitation of the internal audit function, it will investigate actively. banana@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"Saade, seal '10 and 31' reaffirmation agreement, the contests to find a master hand at the North Korean nuclear issue [cbs No Cut News reporters bakjjiwan] a formidable task of Moon Jae-in president, (pictures : Cheong Wa Dae), Moon Jae-in president yesterday.A state visit to China for the first time since he took office (習近平) that his country, Xi Jinping and conflicts triggered by the THAAD (high altitude missile defense system) and the third summit between the two countries.Crunch for a change in the situation. In addition, he will face Chinese President Xi with serious tasks such as emphasizing China's role in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and inviting North Korea's participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics early next year. Donatien Alphonse Francois de Sade, however, aftershocks and conflict, disagreement and North Korean nuclear standoff about the middle of controversy as well as concern the Korea-U.S. alliance, crisscrossing T-DMB backers of the president is so wide the door.Will. ◇ Saade, a perfect conflict 'Seal' vs 'Mibong' according to the president first after the storm door during the On October 14, during his two-day visit the Great Hall of the People in Beijing met in third after taking office.Will hold a summit meeting. Cheong Wa Dae namgwanpyo two conductor during the 11th president told reporters, "" door is the security and expansion and small summit between leaders and seal the patient-physician friendships and trust.The last 20 years or so since the two neighboring countries based on ""saying"" for the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1992, said it would be to evaluate the performance that has been achieved in the development. A senior presidential official, however, said, "" There will be no joint statements or joint news announcements after the Korea-China summit. "" A senior official said as he was ""The door deals concluded in this state visit is very difficult circumstances and under conditions of the president."" about China with our other pending issues yet.(between the two countries,) if they pay a joint statement the other part and to express his position appears there is a challenge, complained. The "" difficult conditions "" and "" situations in which they differ from us "" mentioned by the senior official refer to the storm after the THAAD conflict.The two governments agreed earlier on to improve relations between the two countries, which have worsened since the deployment of the U.S. Forces ' Seongju-Sade in Korea on October 31, and quickly returned to normal development of exchanges and cooperation. However, China's diplomatic lines are known as the "" 3-dollar (不) principle after the "" 1031 Agreement. "" (Can not deploy the THAAD, can not afford to drop the THAAD missiles defense system, and reflect the discord between the U.S. and Japan) Last month, City from the president and a second summit when President Hu Jintao's door 11 days in Da Nang, Vietnam, a Sade, while acknowledging for the seal ""the responsibility of the history"" referring to.Sad even open the possibility of conflict. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also refused to consider further deployment of the THAAD missiles to the United States and China in a speech at an international and diplomatic symposium held in Beijing on July 9 (local time), and urged the two countries to seek further deployment of the THAAD missiles. In the end, when Sade conflict in the third meeting with closure of existing agreements and other voice can, president and our foreign and security lines are as much as possible.'Low key' strategy talks on a pass to the burden on it. ◇ Korea and China are also trying to narrow down the differences over North Korea and missile issues. The talks, which came 15 days after North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICP-15) on July 29, also appear sensitive about China`s demand to stop crude oil imports. China and Russia have set the United Nations Security Council's sanctions to the maximum extent, so ' the biggest pressure on North Korea's dialogue table ' has come into effect. In particular, China has to resolve North Korea's nuclear and missile issues ') (雙中斷 ssangjungdan' and 'parallel) (雙軌竝行 ssanggwe' not back down and would take a stance which the president is the door.The total points. The two sides also refer to the freezing of North Korea's nuclear weapons program, the suspension of South Korea's joint military drills and the denuclearization process of the Korean Peninsula and the negotiation of a peace agreement between the U.S. and North Korea. While participating in international sanctions and pressure on North Korea for its provocations, Xi has repeatedly expressed the need to approach the ` double deck `, a diplomatic solution, while keeping the card of stopping the supply of crude oil. But to offer the president is also the gradual introduction of a solving the North Korean nuclear issue, saying, ""the exit of nuclear disarmament, nuclear freeze is the entrance of the conversation and dialogue"", illegal in North Korea's nuclear and missile development.Legitimate for the discontinuance of Korea-U.S. joint military training can not be redeemed for the Alliance principles was to emphasize that the North Korean nuclear issue 'soft landing' as a summit issue is to find an adept.I know. In particular, it is not possible to emphasize the suspension of crude oil supply to North Korea in order to effectively pressure the North. Last early September in Vladivostok, a door to demand an end to oil supplies to North Korea in a summit between China and Russia, assailed by the president to president, Putin said, emotion to North Korea.We should not be driven into a blind alley and take strong measures to have egg on his face as the government. Donald Trump, president and the United States trying to pressure a backlash from the largest crude oil to North Korea for a diplomatic solution to North Korea views between States, Japan, China and Russia to base the first place in the Korean Peninsula.Theory of the driver ' should reach our government was a powerful solution to the situation. ◇ Another task of inviting participation from North Korea, such as inviting them to Pyeongchang, is the North's bid to attend the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics via China. The president early next year, the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games in North Korea peace to attend the Olympics to host the event because of mounting tension in Northeast Asia, as well as the Korean Peninsula in one fell swoop.Had made several times the plan to lower.Currently, inter-Korean dialogue channels are down and North Korea's relations with China have been on a collision course since the North's launch of the ' Hwasung-15 ', leaving China as the only country that can make any difference. Accordingly, the president for North Korea's 'actions' at the summit China's firm response, while calling for the leverage of, the other hand, China, too.North Korea's Pyeongchang Winter Olympics by taking advantage of participation is expected to use the 'The two-track strategy' who insist. In fact, the president last seven days, Cheong Wa Dae said in a place at a luncheon meeting attended by religious leaders together with a powder keg, and tensions between the two Koreas have never been higher than ever before.Just walk carefully, can become crisis into opportunity. It is the darkest way yet again before daybreak. It can also serve as an opportunity for the two Koreas to develop more dramatically if they successfully ride out the current crisis, he said, hinting at the ongoing government efforts to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula. However, Songtao tin as a special envoy on North Korea last month visited the Chinese Communist Party (宋濤), head of the International Labour Party, Choe Ryong-hae risuyong only meet Kim Jong Un, vice chairman.As seen from the failure of the meeting, China's influence on North Korea is that what they once were became the president is another challenge that must be through the door."

According to the Korea Cryptocode Exchange yesterday, the price of Bitcone is traded at 1.14 million won per line at 11:20 a.m. It rose to 7,700,000 won at 5:40 a.m. yesterday, but plunged to 1,800,000 won in four hours. Choi Jong-koo, chairman of the Financial Services Commission (middle), speaks at a "" financial sector TF for the revitalization of big data "" meeting held at Seoul's Seoulcheong District Office Monday morning. Choi Jong-koo, chairman of the Financial Services Commission, complained the other day about the Bit-coin transaction, saying, "" We can not recognize it as a right-of-capitalization deal, "" but the price of the Bitcone did not change much. On the contrary, the trading price rose to 1.32 million won an hour after Choi's statement was announced the previous day. Choi Jong-koo, Chairman of the Financial Services Commission, told reporters at the time, "" We did not view the Bitcone transaction as a financial transaction.

If the government imposes a tax on cipher money, it will seem that Korea recognizes it as normal trade. Australian researchers at the medical research center QBMR Berghofer found out that although many cancers were unavoidable, some simple lifestyle changes resulted in Australian media deaths by nearly 40 percent.The research team analyzed the Australian Health and Welfare Institute (AI HW) and the NSO data and released the results. David Whitman, a research team professor, said, "" The high rates of cancer in Australia stem from the lifestyle choices many of us make. "" Whiteman also suggested eight lifestyle habits to avoid, saying, "" Cancer is not just a matter of genetics or unhappiness. "" They are smoking, including second-hand smoke, consuming less fruits and vegetables, consuming less meat, excessive intake of alcohol, heavy weight, lack of physical activity, excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and some types of hepatitis C virus (human). Whiteman pointed out that although these risks are not new, evidence is growing that they cause many different forms of cancer. Although it is widely known that smoking causes lung cancer, oral cavity cancer, and throat cancer, it is becoming increasingly known that the areas of the body, such as pancreas, kidneys, and bladder, are causing cancer. Professor Whitman pointed to smoking as the first of these factors to avoid, which accounted for 23 percent (921) of all cancer deaths in Australia in 2013. Other types of cancer that can be prevented are lung, bowel, liver, stomach, and skin melanoma. He also said although the drinks were not at the top of the list of causes of many deaths, they did show obscure results. "" Women's cancer deaths from alcohol were mainly caused by breast cancer, and men's cancer was considered bowel cancer, "" he said, "" although many people usually believe it is liver cancer. "" Liver cancer deaths are more likely to arise from overweight and hepatitis than alcohol, he explained.
