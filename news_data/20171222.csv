Bereaved families criticized the fire department for having failed to break the window on the second floor earlier on. Park, 47, could not keep up with the conversation, saying, I received a call from my mother-in-law asking for help at 5:20 p.m. yesterday. Park lost three members of her family to her mother-in-law (80), her executed (49), and her niece (19) at the same time. Park's execution in a foreign country resulted in the death of a family member when she visited her mother's Jecheon with her daughter who finished college entrance exams last month. After lunch, the three of them went to a public bath to make trouble for themselves. The time her mother-in-law called Park is presumed to have been after the blaze spread throughout the building, considering the reported time was 3:53 p.m. In other words, it means that the female sauna deaths on the second floor were still alive an hour and a half after the fire was reported. A woman who lost her wife in the disaster also said, "" I received a call from my wife asking for help at 4:06 p.m. "" My wife screamed on the phone to let me live in an urgent voice, crying aloud, Yoon. Yoon called 119 quickly after finishing talking to his wife. After calling 119, I called my wife again, but there was no answer. It happened in only five minutes. We will quickly break down windows in the early stages of the fire and find out why the fire brigade failed to rescue us, Kim said to comfort the bereaved. At 3:53 p.m. on July 21, a fire broke out at an eight-story sports center in Haso-dong, Jecheon City, killing 29 people and wounding 29 others. This is the most fatal accident in nine years since the fire at the Icheon Cryocoore Warehouse in Gyeonggi Province in 2008. Firefighters and police authorities are currently conducting a joint investigation to determine the exact cause of the fire, as well as search for additional victims. jeonch@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!) - [Japan's leading childcare center for the global childcare war] - free childcare center for working couples, free of charge of childcare, and waiting costs 20 % Die in Japan! ` This is the title of a blog post that a woman wrote in her 30s wrote earlier last year after failing to get her child into a care center. She said, "" I'm going to mourn for my country and make money out of society. What's wrong with Japan? "" "" It's not about increasing the number of Olympics to 10 billion, but it's about increasing the number of children. "" The word was so popular that it was selected as the most controversial word in Japan last year. That is how many people agree. ◇ Free Level ' Authorized Service Center ' = As the parents ' burden rate is 20 %, Japanese health centers send their children aged between 0 and 5 in the same sense as Korean homes. In fact, Japan's accreditation unit is very well equipped. The accredited center is the one where the size of the centers and the number of childcare center teachers meets the minimum standards set by the state and has been approved by local governments. Parents are burdened by a cost of care of 20 %. Local governments are responsible for the rest. The total cost of health care depends on the level of income of the parents, but low-income people who are subject to welfare measures do not pay any. According to a survey by the Parents Who Think of Children's Hospital, parents who earn an average annual salary in Tokyo tend to have to pay about 30,000 to 20,000 yen per month in childcare costs for their children under the age of 4 years. That means you can trust your children from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. for 200,000 to 300,000 won a month. Even that is a substantial amount of child benefit. In Japan, children are entitled to a monthly allowance of 10,000-15,000 yen until their children reach the age of 15, and when the child benefits are covered by a child's allowance, they can get the authorization center free of charge. Children are being taught at the Hachinos Children's Center in Saitama Prefecture around 11 a.m. On September 26, the Hachinos Children's Center was founded by a social welfare corporation and accredited by the Regional Health Service Agency.Lee Seul-gi : Children are being taught at the Hachinos Children's Center in Saitama Prefecture around 11:00 a.m. On September 26, the Hachinos Children's Center was founded by a local welfare agency.(Photo : Lee Seul-gi), a reporter, said, "" The number of waiting children is not far behind in childcare centers that can support eye care. "" In principle, Japan can apply for admission to an accredited institute only to parents who can not afford childcare at home. When working couples with full-time jobs earn 20 points each, and their grandparents can ask for childcare, they can get one lower grade per day. Because of the fierce competition, the centers can only send working families whose children must be taken care of. Under these circumstances, stay-at-home moms do not even think to leave their children in a care center. In fact, the number of children who applied to the licensed institute who failed to get accepted by the two working couples but failed to get accepted by the local governments ' institute, the "" Children's Reserve, "" which had to reach 60,681. Nearly 70,000 children have been denied access to licensed care centers. Tokyo, the capital of Japan, is known to have applied for the admission of three out of every 10 children who applied to enter the public health center. As they can not wait for an indefinite order, many families end up giving up their mothers ' reinstatement, becoming stay-at-home moms, or leaving their children in an outside care center that is relatively poor and expensive. The situation in Japan's capital city of Tokyo, including the 23 districts of children who have standby children in the area, is higher in areas with darker colors."" Free childcare? More welfare centers? "" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for a "" free childcare "" policy to solve the low birthrate problem last fall. However, Japanese parents are sniffling. Because the cost of care has already dropped to a fairly low level. Parents can ask for more feeding places to trust and give more money to support. Instead of concentrating more money on free childcare, they should spend more money on childcare centers and more teachers.Hucene stressed, adding more care centers is crucial so that not only waiting children but also stay-at-home moms can leave their children in care of childcare centers if they are under heavy stress.Would they use the money for free childcare or for expansion? Korea had the same discussion ahead of the 2012 presidential election, but in the end, we also chose free childcare. However, when negative effects surfaced now, the new government set a new goal to expand the number of state-owned children's homes to 40 percent. It is time to review the nation's childcare system, making the issue of free childcare for Japan a half view. * This project has received support from the media promotion fund.

"Jecheon Fire Girls ' Sauna Death Concentration Why did you get hurt?20 out of 29 women dead by Sauer … and possibly by flowing gas via the entrance of PilottI, the second floor of the automatic gate was filled with toxic gas. Damage to sauna on the second floor was concentrated to the extent that 20 people among the dead were found. It is because the filotis were the closest point to fire on the first floor of the pilotis structure. It was also reported that the flammable materials used in various parts of the building caused the flames to spread quickly and increase the damage. The North Chungcheong Province Fire Department announced at a press briefing at 6 a.m. yesterday that 29 women and 6 men have died. All 28 deaths, excluding one male, were identified overnight. The bodies of the dead are placed in the first funeral hall, Myongji Hospital, Jecheon Seoul Hospital, Sejong Center for the Performing Arts and the Bogung funeral hall. The deaths were carried out in the sauna on the second floor, two on the sixth floor, four on the seventh floor, two on the steps between the sixth floor and the seventh floor, and in restaurants on the 8th floor. Fire authorities said that the sauna on the second floor was the closest to the fire point, and therefore, the damage was most likely.15 cars were parked on the first floor of the Sports Center, where the accident involving the sauna complex was caused by the two women's on the second floor of Jecheon fire. The doorway was the inlet for smoke and toxic gas from vehicles burning, fire officials speculated. In addition, many deaths were found in front of automatic doors of sauna doors for women on the second floor, and the door might not function properly at the time of the accident. The fire department also analyzed that on the 6th and 8th floors, many flammable substances were found inside, causing a lot of smoke and toxic fumes, and causing damage. On the other hand, the fact that the third or fifth floor was free from death allowed more room for evacuation than the second floor, and that of the other two floors had less flammable materials seems to have affected it.

Among them, a high school senior student, a granddaughter, Kim (18), was about to enter university. Kim is the least of the total 29 deaths. Firefighters put out a fire at a fitness center in Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province, Wednesday. According to the fire department of Jecheon City, one of the three family members is a grandmother, mother, and daughter who died in a fire on that day. Min-min and Kim were visiting their home town for the end of the year after the national college entrance exam when they went to take a bath with their maternal grandmother Kim. It was not confirmed until late in the night that the three were a family. Shortly after the fire broke out at 3:50 p.m. in Soja-dong, Jecheon City, bereaved family members told fire authorities, "" Three of my family went to the bathroom of the building and lost contact with me. "" According to the results of the confirmation, the grandmother was at Myongji Hospital and Min and Kim Yang were in Seoul Hospital. Her body was found in the women's bath on the second floor, but was scattered because they did not know if she was related to her first family. The identity of her grandmother and her mother was confirmed immediately, but her identity did not become clear until after 11 p.m. After losing all three of their loved ones who left for the bath, the bereaved family was devastated. A bereaved family member, Park, said, The execution and his wife's niece in Gyeonggi-do visited their home town to take a bath with their mother-in-law and had an accident. My brother (Min's husband), who lost his wife, mother-in-law and daughter, was shocked that I could not speak well.

"- He even laughs at hypnosis to remember where he left his password and hard disk. - If he hacked into a Bitcone purse and got his password back, the reporter Roh Jin-hwan, who wrote the secret access code, wrote in a book. According to Newsweek, the Bitcons have lost 2.87 million since 2009. That is worth about $ 30 billion (approximately 32.412 trillion won).CNBC introduced three cases of attempting to do crazy things to reclaim lost bit coins. The first is an attempt to dig through landfill.James Howell, 32, of Wales, started to make a splash four years ago when he accidentally threw away a hard disk containing 7,500 bit coin (about 4 million dollars at that price). Hard disks lost to Hawells due to the recent surge in the price of Bitcone have become valued at $ 117 million (approximately 126.06 billion won). He tried to squeeze 350,000 tons of waste to find a hard disk, but Newport City would not approve.According to IT media Wired, a landfill is a closed area and breaking and entering a landfill is considered a crime. Moreover, even if hard disks are discovered, they are likely to be contaminated with toxic waste and stop working.The second is to use hypnosis. Investors with early bit coins often do not remember the complicated security code to access their BitTagcoin wallets. In addition, since there was no exchange in those days, they could not find their passwords if they forgot them.However, there is hope for those who forgot their passwords. James Miller, a South Carolina-based hypnotherapist, is practicing hypnotherapy to remember where the passwords and lost equipment are.We have developed (recall) technologies, he said. Miller is charged a commission of 5 % on the value of the beatcoiner recovered. Third, hacking. Mark Frauenfeld, a former Wired Editor wrote down his password on an orange paper last January. Two months later he and his wife went on vacation to Tokyo, Japan.After vacation, Frauenfeld found no paper with a password on it. The maid that he hired during his vacation had thrown the paper away.He recalled and typed in a password in vain. Frauenfeld tried for the next three months but failed to remember his password.Furthermore, as the failure continued, the gap between typing in passwords increased. From July to August, he tried to hack into his electronic wallet, but it failed. Eventually, he decided to give the 15-year-old coding expert $ 3,700 in bit coins and transferred his hacking method to a video, fortunately, he got his password back.Please subscribe for "" IdalI "" on the CBS Network (2004).According to the National Statistical Office's report on the retirement pension as of July 22, 491 people withdrew their pension funds by the middle of last year.

"[Anchor] Fire Department has begun to brief the bereaved family on Jecheon Resort fire.Connect to the field.[IllustrationChungbuk Fire Station President] As a director, I feel deep sorrow and responsibility. I would like to express my sincere apology to my family.Regarding this initial crackdown, the media pointed out that there is something wrong with the initial suppression. As firefighters, I'd like to share a few moments with you about the principles of how we've distorted what we've done on site.Our first report was at 15:53. No special fire has been detected in the nearby CCTVs during initial report hours. However, after 15:54 or 1 minute, the fire will be seen falling from the roof of the parking lot on the first floor of the burning building.And by 15:57 before the fire truck arrives, the fire is already spreading and causes toxic fumes to erupt in large quantities.When I was on the scene, I was at a loss for access to the scene because of the illegal parking vehicles, such as the refraction ladder truck, and other large fire trucks.So our bent fire ladder truck, we'd be able to pull a car up near the site to deploy a ladder, break a window, move the side brakes against us, and move the car over.If you've got the most challenging part when you get to the scene and you haven't broken the upstairs window a little earlier, you've got a lot of people who could have died out there.When we got to the scene, 15 vehicles were in the parking lot, and on the road next to the parking lot, the exterior walls were blazing, and the exterior walls were burning out of 16 cars.And two tons of LPG gas tank is located near the parking lot. So we figured, well, if the fire started with a window, you couldn't actually blow up the LPG gas, so the site's conductor was the first time that you had to show you the burning vehicles at the perimeter of the LPG gas station because of the fire.And we can see rescue workers actually deploy ladders, and later they can break the windows from outside and enter. But at the time of the fire, the fire department at Jecheon Fire Station was not on site due to other rescue operations nearby.And when we arrive on the scene under orders from the scene of this fire, we may have some errors in our time, which is about 16:10 or so.And when they arrived, the rescuers saw that the mattress was hanging from the ground between the third floor and the fourth floor right behind you, so they could see that you had dropped off all of the mattress deployment, and they could start again with that call for a floor.And then the rescue workers go to the basement on the first floor, they go to the electricity room, they go to the rescue, they go in and they talk about people who could be in the glass window on the second floor, they destroy a ladder. We went in, we went inside, we went into the smoke, we did a life search, and we found about two bodies.And then you come down to the ground floor, and you report this to the command. The command team decided, by a report of field runners, that they needed to remove the smoke from the second floor, so they would have to break into a window on the second floor, and they would have to break it.So when we got to the scene as it is now being reported, the first thing we did was to ask for more water on the ground floor parking lots of cars, not destroy glass windows on the second floor.▶ Set up a channel on Naver Neighbor-Neighbor-Neighborhood and read my New Year's fortune in 2018! Many people do not interact or build walls with their neighbors ; relationships with others are common around them.The BonjI team did an experiment to find out the relationship between neighbors. Four apartments in Mapo-gu and Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, Korea had 25 residents moving in, serving rice cakes. The residents asked me several times, "" Why did you come? "" Four families refused, saying, "" I don't need it, "" and three of them refused to open the door although they heard someone was inside. One woman in her 30s said, So far, the only time she has ever visited a neighborhood is when she needed a consent form to move in to build a house.The fire alarm went off at an apartment in Yangcheon-gu, Seoul, in June when the government refused to ask for help. About 20 residents gathered on the first floor, surprised by the noise. One resident suggested "" Let's exchange contact with each other in case of emergencies. "" It is said that only one person raised a hand. The resident of the apartment said, I felt like everybody should change the phone number.Neighbor bonds are falling ; according to a 2016 Korean Survey of Perceptions and Values, the answer to emergency cases involving help from the neighbors dropped by 103 % (72.4 %) to 62.4 % 10 years ago.The survey also showed 170 adults in their 20s and older who answered, "" How many people in the neighborhood do you feel? "" (40.2 percent) answered, "" I don't know. ""The neighborhood rally is also disappearing. Apartment management office in Songpa-gu, Seoul, said, We can`t hold a neighborhood meeting because few residents gather and there are no homes to provide neighborhood gatherings. Only 8 (4.7 %) answered that they have participated in an anti-representation meeting in the past year in this survey. Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province, ended its semi-professional post earlier this year. It is because few of the applicants would do so.Office worker Kang Eun-ju (31) said, I don`t want to date anyone even in my neighborhood, although I am tired of having relationships with people outside. Even the snack bar in the neighborhood I used to go to often stopped because I don`t want my boss to pretend to know me, he said, I think he would interfere with my lifestyle when he gets close to me. "" I met a lot of mothers my age at the local cultural center, but few people have continued to interact, "" said an elderly mother (31), who had a three-year-old daughter. Lee said, I don't think I should be more aggressive when I don't think I can really benefit my neighbors.◇ Environment Without Neighbound`s Help Environment Lee Joon-young, consumer housing professor at Sangmyeong University said, "" Without help from neighbors, we don't need to get along with neighbors by providing more services. "" When the house was empty, I used to ask the person next door to look after it, but now the security services are replacing it. Information about the education of children is not obtained from the ' Mother next door ' but from a professional career center. Child rearing is played by the government or businesses.Some analyze that the younger generation, who are tired of dealing with people at companies and schools, will not even try to form relationships with their neighbors. "" These days, the younger generation had little concept of a neighborhood, "" said sociology professor Shin Kwang-young of the JoongAng University. "" The younger generation recognized the village as an essential community and should get along well with their neighbors. "" As the number of working families has increased, people have less time at home, and the opportunity to meet their neighbors has also decreased.An apartment-oriented residential environment also encourages the severance of relationships with neighbors. Apartments with many people living in small areas are becoming more likely to cause neighboring countries to have conflicts such as noise between floors and parking disputes. Professor Shin Kwang-young said, It is also the reason why no one stays in the same place long due to the increase in housing prices, rent, or rent. "

"" Seong-wan-jong scandal is a media interview and recording that was carried out on April 9, 2015 when former chairman of Gyeongnam Enterprise Chairman Sung Wan-jong risked his own life to investigate the corruption scandal involving volunteers.Lee was indicted on April 4, 2013 for taking 30 million won from Sung at his office in Buyeo, South Chungcheong Province, when he ran for the by-elections. Hong was indicted for receiving a bag of cash with 100 million won in cash from Yoon Seung-mo, former vice president of Gyeongnam, who was ordered by Sung at the National Assembly's assembly hall in June 2011.The court found the two men guilty, one by one. Lee was sentenced to two years in jail in August by the first court (Criminal Court No.22), while Hong (23, Seoul Central District Court) was sentenced to one year and six months in jail. However, the judgment was overturned by the second trial. The second criminal division of the Seoul High Court, which was in charge of appeals to the two, found objective facts and procedures in some of the statements concerned, and found that the contents of the list of Seong Wan-jong were not guilty of reasonable doubt. As the Supreme Court accepted the verdict as usual, not one of the offenders was actually punished. In connection with this, it is also likely that the prosecution will point out that its investigation into the sex issue was incomplete. The investigation team was led by the prosecution and formed a special investigation team. At that time, the investigation team's chief prosecutor was Moon Moo-il (current head of the Supreme Public Prosecutors ' Office), and the vice chief of the investigation team was Ko Bon-seon (current prosecutor general) in western Daegu.Jang Yong Jin's correspondent ohngbear1@asiae.co.kr"

"▽ Fight Fire = As they entered the club in 4 minutes, they could not get to the building rescue like a maze and escape from the toxic gas at the health club. Parking vehicles near the building were found to have delayed entry to equipment such as fire ladders, and internal materials of the building were also used to protect against fire. The building is used by many people, such as a public bath (2-3 floors), fitness center (4-6 floors), sports lounge (7th floor), and restaurants (8-9 floors) (3813 ㎡). Most of the subscribers appear to have been unprotected and were caught in a fire and were unable to avoid it. It is estimated that people did not have time to evacuate as toxic gasses flocked to the entrance of the bathroom on the second floor. Women who were taking a bath in an enclosed space, in particular, did not seem to know immediately about the fire. In addition, a bathroom is an enclosed space with few windows. If toxic gas enters the structure, damage is bound to be extensive. Among the 29 dead, 20 of them were found in women's bathrooms on the second floor. The rest occurred on the sixth and seventh floors, and one was found on the stairs between the sixth and seventh floors. Many of the nurses who were on the scene died from poor clothing because of the bath. Most of them appear to have been strangled with suffocation since there is no sign of fire on the bodies. According to the fire department, the fire started at 3:53 p.m. in the parking lot on the first floor of the building. The toxic fumes from the fire spread quickly to the rooftop using building stairs and elevators. The exact cause of the fire has not been identified yet. We confirmed that the fire started in the parking lot, said an official at the fire department in North Chungcheong Province. The report was made by a bathroom official right after the fire. Firefighters were immediately dispatched to the scene after the report was received. About 20 people who evacuated to the rooftop were rescued by ladder truck and helicopter. The accident was reported to have failed to develop early, as the entry of fire trucks into vehicles parked near the building was delayed. At 3:56 p.m., four minutes after the fire broke out, fire trucks from Jecheon Fire Station were dispatched. However, the parking vehicles around the building prevented rescue efforts quickly. It missed the early Golden Time, which was essential to fighting the fire. We had difficulty accessing the fire site because we failed to secure the road rage required for the fire trucks to enter it, officials said. Due to breakdown in the fire fighting vehicle, residents who had been evacuated to higher ground were also delayed. The weather was so cold that when the valve burst, the trucks remained inoperable for a while, officials said. Another concern is the fact that the exterior walls of the complex store in question were dry-bit, which was vulnerable to fire. The material is the finishing materials used in the urban living housing in Uijeongbu, where 130 people were injured or injured in a fire in 2015. They are so vulnerable to fire that they can not stop calling themselves tinder-like and release toxic gas. The material is widely used at construction sites because it is cheaper than marble or brick finished at up to one-third the price and has a short construction time. The building was painted on top of a dry bit. The Fire Service Act was revised to use non-smoking or flame-related materials on the exterior walls of buildings with more than six floors starting from the end of 2015. The fire department, however, explained that the building was built before 2015 and did not use insulation material. It is possible that the fire caused the fire to spread rapidly, said a professor at Kyungil University in Seoul. Some residents claimed, The recent renovations made to the building also caused the building to become a fast fire. The building was auctioned in 2016 after former owners suffered financial difficulties. Three people co-acquisitions this year and reopened last October. The new paint and interior decoration were caught on fire, and most likely spread rapidly. It is estimated that the structure, which makes it difficult for people inside the building to get out easily and avoid gas fumes, has increased the number of casualties. Some witnesses even say the door was locked and unable to get out. Residents also reported that the opening of a new sports center in Seoul was a result of the increase in customers through discount events. Yoon, a 50-year-old resident, said, "" Sports centers have become increasingly crowded recently, with people who have cut rates. "" Firefighters point out that the fire started under the building. The fire broke out in parking lots on the first floor, built in a pilotic manner. It was not easy for people to escape as the fire started below and spread upward. Some witnesses pointed out the weak structures of the buildings and mistakes in rescue operations. Witnesses said, `` Firemen could not do the job of breaking a bathroom window and trying to rescue it. '' It is also questionable whether the sprinklers in the building went off during the fire. Although we don`t have an obligation to install sprinklers in every building, it is possible that the damage scale of the fire did not work properly. According to the fire fighting law, the combined facilities of the fire fighting stations are equipped with total floor area of 5,000 ㎡ or more and are subject to sprinkler installation regulations.

The Supreme Court's third highest court will announce its ruling at 2:00 p.m. Wednesday against Hong and Lee for violating the political funding law. Whether the Supreme Court agrees to the second trial ruling, which it found innocent of the crime, or whether to send the case back to the same cause as the first trial, which was judged guilty, is noteworthy. Hong was indicted for receiving a bag of cash with 100 million won in cash from Yoon Seung-mo, former vice president of Gyeongnam, who was ordered by Sung at the National Assembly's assembly hall in June 2011. The first judge found Chung guilty of admitting the reliability of former chairman Yun and former chairman Sung's statements and sentenced him to 100 million won in fines in jail for a year and six months. The court consistently stated that Yoon received bags of 100 million won from former chairman Sung and gave it to Hong, from the prosecution, from the prosecution to the court. On the other hand, Seung-sil turned the other side of the bill and found Yoon innocent, saying, "" Yoon's statement lacks evidence. "" The court said that Yoon only makes inferences based on abstract and general experience, adding that some of the statements are inconsistent and difficult to reconcile with the objective facts, and therefore conflicting statements with those of his wife.Lee Wan-gu, a former prime minister who was found guilty of taking illegal political funds from the chairman of a local office in South Gyeongsang Province, was acquitted by the Seoul High Court on September 27 last year. Lee was sentenced to eight million won in a suspended prison sentence by former South Korean president Sung at his office in South Chungcheong Province when he ran for a by-elections on April 4, 2013. Seong-mo admitted his last interview files and transcripts of prior to his death of handing over political funds and found him guilty of being guilty of being able to prove a memo that was called the "" sex bell list. "" On the other hand, Seong-sil said, Among the statements made from the recordings of conversations by former chairman Sung, none of them are considered to have any room for false involvement, or the credibility and accountability of the statements is to be justified. Sung killed himself while being investigated by the prosecution on suspicion of corruption in resource diplomacy in April 2015. After his death, a memo containing their names was found in the pockets of his jacket, and the last interview was revealed to the media. The prosecution later indicted Hong and Lee without physical detention in July of the same year by setting up a special investigation team called the Sung Wan-jong List and investigating alleged lobbying of politicians and money. akang@newsis.com>"

Report by court judge Choi Dong-jun in Seoul = New Sis and Jeon Dong-jun in Seoul On the same day, former prosecutor Jin was found guilty of bribery in the appeals process, so the sentence was extended from four years to seven years in jail. Supreme Court chief justice Kim Shin-seon on July 22 dismissed the charge of bribery by prosecutors in Seoul, who were prosecuted for violating the law on the aggravated punishment of certain crimes, and decided not to pay bribes. Kim Jeong-ju (49), leader of the NXC, who was also prosecuted for two years in jail, was dismissed after the original trial suspension of three years. The court ruled 10 years had passed since the original trial period, when Jin was found guilty of preserving the 425 million won he used to buy Nexon shares in 2005. Kim also decided that he was not guilty of accepting bribes and providing bribes, such as the travel expenses he received from Chairman Kim on Oct. 24, 2007 and the 30 million won he received from the Genesis car acquisition fund. It was judged that the relation between the future task and the benefits is vague and not abstract, it is possible to say that there is a quid pro quo. It was difficult for the prosecution chief to specify what to ask for as the charges themselves, or to specify what to ask the former chief prosecutor to do as an abstract of the case, Jin said in a statement that it was difficult for the prosecution chief to receive. We have not seen any possible future cases involving the functions of the former chief prosecutor to Chairman Kim or Nexon at the time of their establishment of profits, nor do we see any reason for their own involvement, Kim said. "" Former prosecutor Jin had not yet been so concerned about what kind of criminal cases would occur at the time of his return, and had not shown any definite interest in arranging such cases, "" Jeon said, referring to prosecutors who had shown any kind of loss to prosecutors. In addition, he was found not guilty of paying a large profit by selling Nexon Japan, which allowed him to buy Nexon shares, and earning huge profits from the sale of Nexon shares.Seoul News-Six and Lim Tae-hun : Public Prosecutors ' Office in Seoul replied to the prosecutors ' investigation on July 14 last year to find out whether prosecutors suspected of buying "" Nexon unlisted shares as special favors "" by prosecutors. The trial, however, said that the opportunity to buy Nexon shares was necessary and provided with the judgment that it would provide the opportunity to list not only former prosecutors ' chief Jin but also others who were close to him. Jin was prosecuted on charges of receiving a total of 953 million won in bribes, including 250 million won from Kim, who took care of the shares he used to buy Nexon shares in 2005. The investigation revealed that Jin sold the shares for 1 billion won and raised the profit by buying 8537 Nexon Japan stock with 853,000 won. Prosecutors judged that of the total amount to be 873 million won as bribes within the 10-year statute of limitations. In addition, the family received 30 million won in grants from 2009 and received other expenses from the company by using Genesis cars in the name of Nexon Holdings Co. When he closed his internal investigation concerning Hanjin Group, Korean Air was also accused of having to hand over the service to his brother-in-law's cleaning company in August 2010. Prosecutors said, "" We can not believe that the suspicion that Jeon received free stock and vehicles from Chairman Kim was related to her work, "" adding, "" We can not find that she was innocent. "" However, he was found guilty of allowing his brother-in-law to sign a service contract with Korean Air regarding the Hanjin Group's internal investigation and sentenced to four years in jail. Meanwhile, former prosecutor Jin received a 250 million won increased deposit from Chairman Kim in 2005 to purchase Nexon shares and was convicted of paying 30 million won in jail money and traveling to pay a family's rent in the year ahead.

However, the figure is still up 1,300 percent from the beginning of the year.Bloomberg News analyzed that the reason behind the drop in Bitcone is because the billionaire, who has been in the market since the beginning of Bitcone, is believed to be realizing profits. Bloomberg says that because big shots in Δ Bitcoin are in profit making, big investors need cash to continue mining, and therefore, big bit coins are starting to make big shots out of it.Bloomberg estimated that 1000 large investors own 40 percent of the world's bills and interpreted that they are reducing the proportion of bit coins in order to secure cash. Bitconder also needs cash to pay for electricity and computer operations.Bloomberg also stated that the fact that large companies with large bit coins are reducing the share of bit coins is good news for the Chicago Board of Trade (CME) or Chicago Options Exchange (CBOE), which recently released gifts.It is because it is necessary for the owners of the bit coins to find the exact price of the various derivatives, such as the bit-coined gifts, when the base of the bills is extended rather than focusing on some of them. Experts say that in order for the Bitcone to properly enter the drawing control, the base of the owners must be expanded.However, it is also problematic for big players with big bills to leave the market. This could confuse institutional investors. Ants may have small deals, so the market may be too volatile. Therefore, Bloomberg analyzed that the best scenario for the market is for large companies to reduce the share of bit coins rather than leaving the market entirely.Sinopark @"

Witnesses who were on the scene said they would have rescued more people if the glass from the sauna on the second floor, which was killed 20, was immediately awakened. When I checked the body of the deceased wife, her fingerprints were missing, said Ryu Hyo-mo, 59, bereaved of the family. Perhaps my hands were badly damaged as I tried to break a window in a sauna. When you were shouting for help in the sauna and struggling desperately to break through the windows, you were only spraying water outside, said Ryu.

Firefighters say they need to be careful to break through the glass, saying that fires in the building can cause more fire to spread or explode when oxygen is suddenly introduced.The process of rescuing people who were on the skyscraper with a fire truck and an expensive ladder truck at Jecheon Fire Station is controversial. At the scene of the accident, the fire engine was once out of order. Fire authorities explained that it took about 30 minutes to install the fire truck because of cars parked at the scene of the accident, not because of mechanical problems.

"Let's connect with Lee Ki-hyun, a resident of Jecheon. Is this you with me, Lee Ki-hyun? Dear Lee Kihyun ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Thank you for your hard work. D. Lee Ki-hyun > No. Where are you now? ◆ Yi Gi Hyun > I am watching the situation again before I go to work. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Are you in front of Jecheon Fire Station? ^ Lee Ki-hyun > is now in front. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > How is the situation now? Is the fire all set or is it completely off? I can see that the fire is digested by the naked eye. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Now that the building is in the morning, you can start to see it with your own eyes. What is it look like, what's the status now? ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : Did you ride them completely black, the whole 8th floor? ^ Lee Ki-hyun > Yes, it is correct. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > totally destroyed. When did you arrive at the scene of the fire yesterday? When Lee Ki-hyun arrived at the downtown, you should finish the work and call Lee Ki-hyun. I arrived on the scene around five o'clock because I said, "" People are hanging on the rails now, and I think I can save them when we get our equipment. "" ◇ I heard that you are running a private crane company, Lee Ki-hyun > My father runs the company and I help him too. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : Where is the crane? ^ Lee Ki-hyeon ^ The official name is ‘ Chariot Work Tea. ’ If you look at the crane, it has a bucket that you can use to build your work in which you ride it. You went to Jecheon building right on your way back from work with Kim Hyun-jung. ^ Lee Ki-hyun > Yes, he has entered immediately. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > The fire broke out at 3:50. When did you arrive? I arrived around 5 pm ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > 5pm. Then, one hour after the fire, how was the situation? ◆ Yi Gi Hyun > Smoke was coming out from inside through the broken windows. But first of all, I think it's the point where I have to get three people out of the banister, so I need to get them out as fast as I can, so we shouldn't have been able to have our bucket rescue, but let's put a boom on. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > No, did you see that people were still hanging on the 7th or 8th floor after an hour? Lee Ki-hyun > Yes, it was a situation when people were waiting for rescue on the railing. Fortunately, my father is a bit of a veteran, so I didn't even notice him driving the crane sensationally, posting it on the wall, and riding on our bucket. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > That was enough. After waiting for about a minute or so, I lowered it as carefully as possible to the four stories, and as the fog lifted, I saw three people riding in our bucket. And he sighed with relief. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > How many people are in the room and whether they are male or female, were they in the same place when they posted the structure by instinct? Yes, we asked as soon as we got off, we could ask for more persons, but they were not there anymore, so we quickly withdrew our equipment and found another place to go. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > I see that. Thank you for your efforts. But we can't do anything about it because there are so many victims right now. ^ Lee Ki-hyun > True. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Thank you. Thank you for your testimony today. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung is the one who brought in a private crane to help with the rescue. I tried connecting with Lee Ki-hyun first. As you have heard, there have been too many casualties, although your fire truck arrived too early. Some say the fire spread quickly. Why is that? Let's connect with an expert. We are connected to Professor Lee Young-ju of Fire Prevention at Seoul National University. Professor Lee Young-ju, are you with me? A sports center fire area in Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province is closed to the public on July 21. The Chungbuk Fire Department said that as of 9:30 p.m., 29 people were killed in the blaze and 26 injured. (Photo : Hwang Jin-hwan) ♫ Lee Young-ju > Yeah, hi. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > So fire is starting in the parking lot on the first floor, but when I heard the survivor on the third floor, the fire bell was already ringing out of the window. How could it spread so fast? If you look at the video footage and photographs from the fire, it is very possible that the lower level of the slottie burned down rapidly, creating a high degree of smoke and flames. Now, it's not really that big, but it's not that the fire spread directly over the entire building. Smoke and flames could have fallen into the pilotly-linked building, down the stairs or into the doorway so it would have been able to spread out quickly to the upper levels. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > So, 29 of the victims died of suffocation rather than from burns. You can tell by looking at it? ◆ yeong ju I seumnida > geureonikka, so it is possible that the staircase inside may have smoke coming in through the windows, for example, but in reality the damage caused by the smoke is much higher in the staircase or in the vertical penetration. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > The toxic gas may have gone up the stairs vertically, and you may have choked up this much. ^ Yiyeongju > Yes, it is correct. In fact, if you have a rapid flow of smoke through the stairs, people on each floor actually have no place to run. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Here is one stairs and one elevator. And so the only vertical escape route to get to the shelter -- this staircase itself is, in fact, unavoidable, and they were trapped in a situation where smoke was coming in very rapidly. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > particularly now, 20 of the 29 deaths were discovered in women's bathrooms. Baths for women on the second floor. Of course, this is why the fire is under the women's bath, but even so, how did you get so much damage here? I don't really understand this. As a characteristic of sauna, they wear clothes, take a shower, or wash their hands. In fact, these spaces are very closable. And the fact that it's highly closed-end is, in fact, the fact that it's not easy to evacuate in an emergency, or that you're already able to get out of here or something, and most of you're probably already aware of it, it's too late. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Okay. The only escape, the exterior material problem, the complicated maze of structures, was the stairs, and all smoke must have flowed in. You point out like this. If you listen to them, it is this comment that too many rescue efforts have caused the situation to worsen. Yes, I heard the news, but it is very unfortunate that the same thing happened in other accidents that happened yesterday. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Correct. How many vehicles were parked illegally around the building when the fire department went out in person? If you want to get into a fire department, you need to get a fire truck to get into a fire department immediately because of the narrow road. Your car is less than 6 meters wide. The car has to have a minimum clearance of about 10 meters and an altitude of at least 8 meters to stop and deploy and work. And even if you have one illegal parking on most of these expressways, it's really hard to get the fire done properly because the road is very narrow. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > mmeters is not secured. It's an eight-story building, but there's no 8-meter clear in front of it. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > This is a different story. Witnesses said the ladder truck could not stretch the ladder, but the fire department once did. When I opened it, I folded it because it was not possible to do so, and now I tell you it's broken. And I don't know why the ladder truck didn't work right the first time, although I don't. ◆ I yeong yakkan , ju , > ireultemyeon na ga myeonseo n myeon cheung I eun bubun . jache n gyeongsaji hwajae ga I doe I hyeongseong geonmul neunde creates an inclined plane with the buildings themselves on the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th floors. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : Like a pyramid. Even if the ladder truck deploys, you should have an angle to do this or that kind of work. So when the building leans, it's going to look like a ramp."
"In fact, the fire department has a good point. So these are the areas that the fire department is talking about -- whether it's just a breakdown, whether it's an operation, whether it's a field decision -- it's a little bit more to be watched. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > should wait and see. Now you can see that it has very few windows. There are so many of these buildings these days. Windows small, mostly glass, structures that affect fire, like fire? If you see a building with a larger floor area than 1000 square meters, you know, if you see a larger building, it's got a larger floor area. If the structure is windowless, you can install a smoke trap to remove smoke in the event of a fire or you can force smoke from inside the building. Now, in the case of this building, where the fire broke out, you couldn't get the smoke out when you couldn't get rid of all these vulnerabilities, like in case of fire, as the master said. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I see. The possibility of inadequate ventilation, even though we're operating in a glass structure, you said. As a result, many windows are hidden or are blocked from being opened. And that could actually make it worse. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Let's see here. Professor, thank you. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Professor of Fire Prevention Lee Young-joo of Seoul National University connected. Clean it up again. The fire at Jecheon yesterday. 29 people died. Among them, 23 women, 6 men, and 20 women were found in women's bathrooms and on the second floor. A little while ago, firefighters went back in at 6:30 and started work on finding the victims of their lives that they might have left. I'll tell him as soon as I get more breaking news. Hong Joon-pyo handed to the trial put his name this list the Saenuri Party leader and former prime minister is not guilty to the iwangu. It was the ' ability of evidence ' of key evidences that divided the fate of those convicted in the first trial. The third part of the Supreme Court (Supreme Court justice Kim Chang-seok) dismissed the appeal by prosecutors and confirmed the original trial on July 22, when Hong was acquitted. ▲ of the Supreme Court judgment of acquittal 'full smile' Hong Joon-pyo delegates to the ‘List of seongwanjo’ scandal, the Supreme Court acquitted, the free Korea Party leader Hong Joon-pyo, Seoul on July 22.Headquarters in Yeouido, his position after a big smile and talk with reporters. Regarding the judgment on his acquittal, Hong said, I will certainly hold myself responsible for the fabrication of evidence by prosecutors established during the trial, adding, I will now focus on the Republic of Korea as a free and fair conservative group. ⑨ Yoo Seong-ho, chairman of the ruling Uri Party, said, "" We can not trust the statement made by Yoon Seung-mo. "" Hong received 100 million won in cash when he was indicted in June 2011 by Chairman Sung Wan-jong of the National Assembly's office in Seoul. It was the time when the GNP was about to run for party chairman. The court later sentenced former vice president Yun to 100 million won in additional fees for one year and six months in jail, acknowledging all of the statements made by the money and gifts carrier. However, Hong was not arrested because he was one of the two most important governors at the time. However, the appeal resulted in the exact opposite. The court said, "" Even though Chairman ▲ Hong was short of funds for the primary elections, he could not find the motivation to accept bribes from the former chairman, who is not familiar with the former chairman, and the former vice chairman of the House of Representatives, Yun, who was in charge of the committee, said he was unable to back up his statement. The main evidence was stripped and acquitted. The Supreme Court also saw the decision of the court as correct. In order to admit a crime in criminal trial, strict evidence should not have enough room for reasonable doubt, but evidence submitted by the prosecution alone was found to be insufficient, which led to the prosecution's indictment. The Supreme Court's third highest court judge, Justice Kim Jae-hyung, also confirmed Lee`s innocence, which was set forth on the Seongwanjong list. Lee was accused of taking 30 million won in cash from Sung at his campaign office in Buyeo, South Chungcheong Province, before the by-elections in April 2013. The key evidence was an interview with the reporter just before Sung died, and a memo from his jacket. As in Hong's case, the case was acquitted as the ability of evidence to prove key in the appeals process was a problem. Based on the same evidence, the two courts concluded that "" the evidence against sex is not confidable based on the evidence in the case that the evidence in the sex records is misleading "", and that the statements made by Chairman Sung were made right before he died. Regarding this, the court judged that former Chairman Sung's testimony was reliable, for instance, because it was hard to believe that he lied before he died. However, the court judged that former Chairman Sung made a false statement at the time of the interview as he felt betrayed by Lee. In a memo called the list of last names, former Prime Minister Lee was also acquitted of paying a certain amount in a statement immediately before his death. The Supreme Court also judged that the criminal procedure law would allow it to accept the original verdict, which did not recognize the ability of the former chairman to prove his testimony. The list was unveiled in April 2015 by Sung, a former chairman who was put on the prosecution`s dragnet for corruption in resource development. We gave 700 million won to Huh Tae-yeol, former presidential chief of staff, and $ 100,000 to Kim Ki-choon, just before we took our own lives, the spokesperson of Kyung-hyang Newspaper and told reporters. And who in his jacket pocket 'Hong Joon-pyo gyeongnamdo of 100 million', 'Minister Yoo Jeong-bok visited mayor of Incheon 3 billion' and 'iwangu' without that the memo was found. Based on this, the prosecution indicted Hong and Lee. Moon Moo-il, the current head of the prosecution's special investigation team, was in charge of the investigation.Copyright Copywriter (c) Omai News (Citizen Reporters), Unauthorized Child and Redistribution geumji ☞ ne majimak se [ gingeup ] wol ho seutori kaempein gajok mit nyuseu ... ...

Shin Dong-bin, 62, the second son, was sentenced to probation and avoided arrest. Chairman Shin seemed nervous as time went by, while Chairman Shin remained calm. The Seoul Central District Court's criminal agreement with the ruling on Monday passed a suspended prison sentence of 4 years and 3.5 billion won in fines on the chairman of the Lotte family.We decided it would be good to establish managerial transparency at a level that meets the standards of the international and the public, and to help develop the national economy in substance, the court said.Chairman Shin's face was gloomy from the attendance of the Seoul Central District Court until the judgment of the court was announced. He just listened to the judgment of the court without moving at all. Even after leaving the courtroom, his face was gloomy. When asked what they thought of the verdict, he briefly apologized to the public, and left.Meanwhile, Chairman Shin, who was able to rest due to the consideration of the court's decision in consideration of the trial lasting nearly two hours, appeared anxious as the sentence of the sentence was closer. After entering the courtroom about an hour and a half after the trial began, Chairman Shin responded by talking to himself when the court mentioned the charges against him. When the court sentenced her to four years in jail, she screamed and protested. Shin Dong-ju, former vice president of Lotte Holdings, and Seo Mi-kyung, 57, a de facto marriage to the chairman, were acquitted, jailed for two years, and suspended for three years. They also showed little response during the trial. However, Seo stared at Shin whenever he appeared in court. Former Chairman Shin was sentenced to two years in jail.Shin remained silent with a dark face when asked by reporters what they thought of the verdict.

The Supreme Court on July 22 confirmed its original verdict that Hong, who was indicted on charges of violating the political funds law, and Lee, who was acquitted by the Supreme Court in the spirit of raising their voices. Judge Kim Chang-seok was in charge of Hong's case, and Judge Kim Jae-hyung was in charge of Lee`s case. We can not consider the charges to have been proven without reasonable doubt, and the judgment on the original verdict was not made by misunderstanding the related laws, the court said. Hong was indicted without physical detention on charges of receiving 100 million won in illicit political funds from a close aide to the former GNP Chairman, then ahead of the GNP leadership race in June 2011. The first judge pleaded guilty in September last year to a guilty plea made by Yoon, which resulted in a one-and-a-half year jail term and a surcharge of 100 million won. However, Hong was not legally arrested for being the incumbent governor of South Korea at the time. However, the second trial division, Seoul High Court Criminal Division 2, said Hong has no clear motive to receive 100 million won from the former chairman whom he normally had no contact with, and rather, he could not be falsely convicted by a money and gifts carrier Yoon. Yun's statement contained many abstract contents, inconsistency, and conflicting with others ' statements, making it hard to believe it as it is. It was also pointed out that Yoon's testimony that the National Assembly's office gave money to him during the time of the crime was under construction was contradictory.Lee Wan-goo, a former prime minister of South Gyeongsang Province, is acquitted by the Supreme Court before the parliamentary by-elections on July 22. The trial of former Prime Minister Lee, who was charged with taking 30 million won in cash from former Chairman Sung, who visited the presidential office during the April 24 by-elections in 2013, also went on the same route as Hong. Based on the interview with the media, which was left behind by the late Chairman Sung, Lim was sentenced to eight months in jail, two years of probation, and 30 million won in surcharge. The former chairman did not make a direct statement in court after his death, but he saw the telephone interview he left behind as evidence under criminal law. However, Seong-mo 2 pleaded not able to acknowledge the interview as evidence, and thus pleaded not guilty. Among former chairman Sung's pre-death interviews of giving bribes to Lee, it is hard to believe that Lee`s statement was made in a ' especially credible state ' and therefore not capable of producing evidence. The Criminal Procedure Act shall be regarded as evidence of the person's failure to make a statement in court, for example due to reasons of death, when it has been documented or made in a ' especially reliable state '. The case was exposed to money by former chairman Sung, who was investigated on suspicion of corruption in resource development, during a telephone interview with a reporter on April 9, 2015 who was about to die on his own, including Hong and Prime Minister Lee. The prosecution is called 'very much a list of Sung' at the end of the investigation after sex with the words '100 million Hong Joon-pyo, iwangu' in a memo of fostering not only left in one lifetime.The recording can confirm that they have delivered money in the claim that two people prosecuted.

"Police have begun an investigation into the fire at Jecheon Sports Center in North Chungcheong Province. Police and fire authorities are making all-out efforts to determine the exact cause of the blaze and the locations of the blaze, with the possibility of a heated installation of a parking lot piping on the first floor. Five members of the National Institute of Scientific Investigation, including nine police officers, conducted a joint examination on the floor of the fire on July 22. The examination began in the morning and was carried out around the parking lot on the first floor, which is believed to have been the first time the fire started. Police and fire authorities estimate that flames caught the styrofoam during the hot line installation on the first floor of the parking lot, and flames spread rapidly when the burning styrofoam fell on the car. Although it is not clear yet why the fire started, it is known that the prosecution secured evidence to support the conclusion of the fire through the examination of the first floor, testimony of witnesses, and video analysis of CC (closed circuit) TV. Whether or not to change the use of the building illegally is also under investigation. Police are investigating building owners and managers for possible irregularities in the process of expanding the seven-story building to the ninth floor. The burning building, which has a nine-story basement floor, was operated as a sports center with sauna, fitness center, golf range, and restaurants. The seven-story building was originally built as a seven-story building, but it was extended two times in 2012 and 2013, respectively, to the 8th and ninth floors. It has been reported that it closed for the past few months and reopened in October. There was also evidence from residents that the sauna doors on the second floor of the sports center did not work properly. The sauna on the second floor was the most prone to death from the fire, with 20 people found dead. It is suspected that the failure to evacuate due to the lack of access to the gate contributed to the disaster. In addition, it was reported that the sport-center sprinkler valves were locked during the fire, preventing the sprinklers from operating on all floors of the building. Firefighters have also begun searches for life but no more victims were found. However, two people, Lee (71) who were rescued or escaped from the hospital during the fire, felt unwell and were treated at a hospital. As a result, the number of casualties of the fire increased to 60. The death toll is 29 and the injuries are 31. Among the dead, 23 women were identified and all of them were identified. Police requested an autopsy on an unidentified person at the National Institute of Defense. In a news conference, Jecheon Mayor Lee Keun-kyu, who is head of the disaster safety committee, said, We will work with related agencies to determine the causes of the disaster and to take legal action. As a result, Jecheon City will establish and operate disaster safety headquarters to provide exclusive support for the bereaved families of the First to One. Mayor Lee confirmed nothing wrong with the remodeling`s remodeling and inspections of the buildings, said he concluded late last month with a re-modeling. It has been confirmed that they were used after the checks were completed. ▶ hitting all the goals of the world press photo =, Yonhap News Agency jun@fnnews.com Joon Park and the fire story, Jecheon-si, Chungbuk, ▶ '` Pas ` fn' copyright ⓒ. ※ The star that can be seen in the entertainment news fnUnauthorized, The Financial News from redistribution of the war damage - and 29 to … the more time are wounded - always - as if the president, rapid fire suppression and minimize casualties.Directive - Administration Minister & Fire dispatch fire chief, Jecheon-si, Chungbuk, Korea 21 [edaily a bakcheolgeun] in Sports Center building in the eighth floor of the fire caused severe casualties sustained.Increasing.The agency said the death toll rose to 58 as of 9:40 p.m. yesterday, with 29 dead and 29 injured.

"【 New Sis&amp;Park Jin-New Sis-New : A day after the death of a newborn, the intensive care unit of a new baby is temporarily closed at Ewha Womans University Hospital in Seoul. Four children, two babies and two girls, died in succession from 9.30pm on 16 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. in the Inter-interception of Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital. ▽ Proverbs of the Seoul Medical Center : Incredulity, Incredulity, Investition, and Dispossession of Doctors, As the cause of death of newborns is blamed on medical malpractice and mismanagement, many citizens are voicing their opinions online, demanding the truth behind the incident and the hospital's closure. More than 20 petitions were posted on the presidential office's public petition saying the death of a newborn should be investigated from July 17-21. One petition, which calls for an investigation into the case at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital, has already received support from over 1,000 people. The petition writer said, If the weak parents are sick, they can only go to the hospital and consult a doctor, adding, I personally asked the four baby angels and all Korean parents who lost at Ewha Womans University Hospital to investigate. Other petitions are also calling for tougher punishment for relevant medical teams and hospitals, citing the need for consolation and compensation for infant parents. Some creators have also called for hospital temporary closures and disclaimers of doctors responsible for the cases. 【 Seoul = New Sis&amp;Let's Office of Public Affairs posted on the bulletin board of the Presidential petition on July 17. A petition requesting the truth behind the "" Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital case "" received support from over 1,000 people as of July 21. A petition titled ` Please Lock Up Ewha Hospital temporarily ` urged the hospital to temporarily close down and make further inquiries to avoid further victims. The cause of death for the four newborns is not yet clear. However, as the families of the families of the hospital responded, and the failure of the intensive care unit management system for infants continued, many are voicing their responsibility for the hospital. Bereaved families of the victims said, "" Nurses often touched children without sanitary gloves, and they did not wash the blackmailing and took care of the children again. "" After the scandal broke, the hospital gave a press briefing without even hearing from the bereaved family. In addition, during the first discussion with the bereaved family on July 20, they handed out unsatisfactory explanations and walked out of the house in about 20 minutes. Internet fertility and childcare related communities are also receiving a great deal of criticism from Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital. One Internet user who uses the ID ` edit ** ` said, It is very sad to see that babies become my baby friends every time I see the article. Did the people who saw the young children and treated them themselves take care of the children with weak immune systems like that? I`m so mad, stressed the punishment we must take to make sure it does not happen again. Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital was once criticized for frequent accidents. In September, bugs were found in sap injected into an infant of five months old. The KFDA's investigation was hard to avoid the mistakes of doctors who failed to properly examine the finished products before giving the baby a drink. Last July, a nurse working in an intensive care unit of a newborn at the hospital was confirmed to have tuberculosis. The Seoul Metropolitan Government and Yangcheon-gu Community Health Center conducted an epidemiological study of 166 newborns and 50 employees who were hospitalized at the time, and checked two infants and five employees for latent tuberculosis. Though the development of tuberculosis did not occur, it made parents nervous that it is likely to develop into tuberculosis patients in the future. • New Scientist and Choo Sang-cheol : On the morning of July 17, when four newborns were killed one after another, the guardian carried the child in a stroller at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital in Seoul. The Seoul Yangcheon-gu Police Station announced on July 16 that four new residents died in an intensive care unit of newborns at Ewha Womans University's Mok-dong Hospital from 9:30 p.m. - and are currently investigating. The hospital officially apologized for diagnosing hundreds of patients with the mixed X-rays in June 2014. Due to a mistake by the chief radiologist, about 500 patients received the wrong treatment with X-ray images that changed sides from late 2013 to April 2014.The accident of a premature baby being blinded by medical errors at Ewha Womans University's Mok-dong Hospital was also reported. The 12 Department of Civil Agreement at the Western District Court in Seoul ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on July 13 in a suit filed by A and his parents against Ewha School, the hospital's operating foundation. The court ordered the hospital to give A 399.29 million won and the parents 8 million won. Born in early December 2015 at the hospital, the patient was diagnosed with premature retinopathy in March the following year. Retinous infantile retinopathy can cause blindness due to diseases in the retina blood vessels that are abnormal due to high oxygen, hypoxia, and low blood pressure. The patient was pronounced blind, the parent said. The medical team should have never tested Ahn when they were four weeks old, the judge said, acknowledging their mistakes. However, the scope of responsibility was limited to 50 %, taking into consideration that it was not part of the high-risk group of pathology and that considering the success rate of the treatment, it was not possible to avoid loss of vision, even when discovered earlier. jabiu@newsis.com> Naju Dredlegang Girls High School Girls ' High School Victims Victims[Confect the Arming of Unexcused Ordinance DeHandeon ' The first case of a murder trial on Naju Girls ' Bereaved Family The Supreme Court's first ruling on July 22 was made against Kim (40) who was indicted on charges of violating the law on the punishment of sexual assault crimes and the protection of victims (rape and murder). The murder of a high school girl was discovered in February 2001 in Naju, South Jeolla Province, when a high school girl was raped and drowned. Police found body fluids presumed to be those of the criminal, but were unable to find a DNA matching suspect and the case remained unsolved. It was not until 2012 that DNA's owner was found to be Kim, who was sentenced to life in jail for killing other robbers in a gene database at the Supreme Public Prosecutors ` Office. However, Kim admitted to having a meeting with a female high school student, but insisted that they loved each other, and the prosecution cleared him of murder in 2014, saying it was insufficient evidence. The investigation, which cleared Kim of any charge of DNA, was continuously debated. Eventually, re-investment began when the so-called Taewan Act, or the law that removes statute of limitations on murder cases, was enforced in 2015. Prosecutors seized the jail and secured evidence of using disguised photos of his alibi on the day of the incident, and rehearsing with other prisoners for the investigation and trial. Kim was also charged with rape last August, 15 years after the incident, based on information on her health, death, and access to an Internet chat site she met with, she said in her school journal. In January this year, Young-ju sentenced Kim to life in jail, having time to repent of his wrongdoings and to his victims and his bereaved family, while sentencing her in a semi-British way. I judged that the sentence of the second depth trial in August was appropriate. This is the first time that Tae-wan was found guilty of murder after the statute of limitations was repealed. banghd@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"A serious crack was discovered on July 11 when a Shinkansen was headed for Tokyo from Fukuoka Hakada Station. The truck supporting the car body has been divided by about 14 cm.Periodiction and oil spill have also been identified in the surrounding parts. It was a giddy situation, when a Shinkansen running at speeds over 300 km/h could derail it.In fact, last May, a derailment occurred at a low-demonse ordinary train due to a truck crack.That's why Japan's National Transportation Committee has called the incident its first major incident.[Yoshie Norihiko ko JRinihon Vice President : I deeply apologize to you for disobeying your confidence in the safety of Shinkansen this time.] The exact cause of the crack has not been identified yet. Japanese media have a variety of analyses.[KonishI Miho miho Japan NTV Broadcast reporter : (experts) can not tell you there are complicated causes, such as corrosion of the materials used or invisible material failure during the manufacturing stage. ] The problem was even bigger, as the Shinkansen showed signs of abnormality right after its departure, it lasted for over 3 hours.Flight attendants on the train reported hearing something burning and making strange noises, but Tokyo's command office ignored it.The train stopped only at Nagoya station by running 800km. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport began a thorough investigation of the situation.[IshiI Keichikoshina Regional Transit Minister : I would like to verify the validity of my decision to keep me running. ] The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport also instructed five major railway companies to conduct an emergency inspection of all 4,800 Shinkansen vehicles.Since its launch in 1964, no one has been killed by a passenger.However, people in Japan are uneasy about the vehicles ' deadly cracks and the railroad's insensibility to safety.

The Supreme Court has decided whether to maintain individual appeals to these lawmakers on July 22. The election will be nullified when a sentence with a fine of more than one million won is declared. The Supreme Court will decide Rep. Yoon Jong-oh (54-1998) of the People's Democratic Party, the predecessor of the Unified Progressive Party, and Kim Jae-jung (43 - Yeon-Yeo - proportional), the incumbent mayor of Jeonbuk Province. Their shades of light is forecast to be mixed. Rep. Lee was acquitted in the second trial of circulating false information to smear rival candidates during last year`s general elections, but Rep. Yoon was fined 3 million won for his pre-election campaign and Kim 2 million won for his support of the party's candidate. Lee Chul-kyu, the third lawmaker to be acquitted by the ruling Uri Party, was acquitted by the Supreme Court on December 22 on charges of violating the parliamentary and presidential election law. Lee was shown in Seoul High Court on July 15 and was shown to have been in attendance at an appeals court. [Joint news] Supreme Court justice Cho Hee-kyung, who was acquitted of violating the law yesterday. Rep. Lee was sent to trial last year on suspicion of cheating high school diplomas in last year`s general elections. He previously registered for the preliminary candidate and posted the message ' graduating from Seongnam S High School in Gyeonggi Province ' on the official blog board on December 28, 2015. On March 7 and April 8, last year, he attended a high school debate as a media interview and as a candidate. Prosecutors applied the charge of violating the Public Officials Election Act and handed it over to the court, believing it to have released false information to win the election. The issue of the trial was the judgment on the diplomas Lee presented as evidence. The first sentence was considered false, but the second sentence "" The defendant received a diploma in the name of the head of the school at S High School, which was completed and issued by the person in charge who authorized it. "" The Supreme Court quoted the judgment as follows : Lee woke up again like a ' Oh Tung-yi '. The police ex-convict will set a new record of his innocence by being prosecuted three times. It was the first time that he was arrested for taking bribes in 2003 when he was the chief of the Ansan Police Department in Gyeonggi Province. However, the Supreme Court acquitted him of the crime in 2005 and returned him to police. Lee was arrested the following year on suspicion of taking bribes from Yoo Dong-cheon, the chairman of Jeil Savings Bank, in 2011 when he was head of the Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency. The case was also acquitted by the Supreme Court in October 2013, more than two years later. However, he was excluded from promotion and assignment due to the incident and left the police station voluntarily. During last year's general elections, he failed to qualify for the Saenuri Party and ran as an independent before the National Assembly. Prosecutors, however, raided Lee`s office on April 14 on suspicion of pre-election campaigning shortly after Lee`s election card was granted. Although it was found to be unrelated to Lee, he was sent to trial on suspicion of cheating on his high school education and was acquitted by the Supreme Court for the third time on July 22. The ruling Grand National Party lawmaker Kim Han-pyo and the Democratic Party's Kim Chul-min also sentenced Rep. Kim Han-pyo, who was indicted on charges of circulating false information under the election law, to pay 800,000 won in fines. Kim was earlier dismissed after receiving a final ruling on jail term and a suspended two-year Supreme Court sentence in a statement to the media about a year before the elections. We are also considering designating the shipbuilding sector as a special employment support sector because of our efforts, a charge of circulating false information was also applied to one part of the conference. The first and second trial courts considered the statement to be false. However, he judged that it did not affect the actual election very much because it was about a year before the general elections. Regarding remarks about the shipbuilding industry, Kim was fined 800,000 won, accepting Kim`s claim that although it is somewhat exaggerated or misleading, its efforts were close to truth. The second part of the Supreme Court confirmed the original original decision, which gave a fine of 900,000 won to Rep. Kim Chul-min, who was also charged with falsely transferring to the National Assembly before the April 13 general elections last year. More than two months before the general elections, Kim was indicted in February last year on charges of transferring the addresses of himself and his family members to his brother's home in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, and falsely transferring them to the election. In addition, he invested 3.2 billion won in an apartment project in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, from 2008 to 2009, and reported that the value of the government officials ' assets were reduced to 1.3 billion won when the claim was filed at the end of December 2015. We have found the charge of fake resident registration from the first trial to the Supreme Court guilty of being guilty, but the claim can not be considered as a reduced claim as a result of calculating the value of the bonds.

It has been 429 days since he was handed over to trial in October last year. The Seoul Central District Court's criminal agreement with the Constitutional Court on July 22 was found guilty of aggravated economic crimes against Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin, and found that he had been sentenced to jail for one year and eight months on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust. Shin was found not guilty of breach of trust on RothepI Esnet, a special law designed to cover 47.1 billion won, because it is a management judgment. The corruption charges related to the management of Lotte Cinema's concession stand were also considered not to have resulted in damages, according to the special law, but to the criminal code. Shin Kyuk-ho was sentenced to four years in jail and 3.5 billion won in fines after being convicted of misappropriation and embezzlement charges. Big tax evasion is not allowed. However, they were not formally arrested for health reasons. The part that gave free pay to Shin Dong-ju, former vice chairman of Lotte Holdings Co., was also acquitted.

The Korea Meteorological Administration announced its forecast for Korea's weather conditions for the past three months on July 22. According to the Korea Meteorological Administration, high atmospheric pressure will affect many dry days in January. In particular, as the cold continental high atmospheric pressure expands, it is expected that the temperature will fall significantly. Although temperatures remain similar to the average year in February, changes in temperatures are expected to occur significantly due to the effects of continental and migratory cyclones on a regular basis. In March, similar weather will continue to be held in Korea, mainly affected by migratory high atmospheric pressure.Looking at the monthly average temperature forecast, 40 % of the national average temperature is likely to be lower than the average annual temperature in January (- 1.6 - - 0.4), 40 % on similar days, and 20 % on higher days. In February, 20 % of days are forecast to be lower than usual (0.4 ~ 1.8 degree), 50 % on similar days, and 30 % on higher days, and 50 % on similar days when March is expected to be lower than usual (5.5 - 6.3 degree).Rainfall will be generally similar to an average year. The national average January rainfall is 18.4 to 28.7 ㎜, 19.2 to 41.5 ㎜, and 47.2 to 59.9 ㎜ in February.In addition, Korea is expected to remain weak during this period. Raninya is an anomaly in eastern Pyongyang, where the sea level is lower than half a degree per year and the water temperature is lower than usual for five months.When La Nina occurs during winter, low-pressure currents form near the Pacific Northwest, causing a series of northern winds to enter Korea more often than usual, so the temperature is lower than usual and the rainfall tends to be lower.""

"Firefighters put out a fire at a fitness center in Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province, Wednesday.Photo : The Jecheon Sports Center in North Chungcheong Province, which had caused 29 deaths in Yonhap News Agency, lost its original "" dry bit "" as an internal wall finish, and the "" Pillobit "" structure was used as an external wall finish. ① The flame-rich fire spread quickly to the second floor as vehicles on the ground floor of a sports center made a loud bang, according to the highly flammable and toxic fire department. The main cause of the blaze was the dry-bit, which was used as the finishing materials for buildings. The method finishes by applying styrofoam or urethane on the outer wall of a building and applying cement mortar. Although it costs less than 50 percent to construct an outer wall with stone, it is composed of materials that are highly flammable and produce toxic gas when burnt. Firefighters put out a fire at a fitness center in Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province, Wednesday.Photo : Jeong Sang-man, a construction and environmental engineering professor at Kongju-University University in Busan, was also quoted as saying in an interview with YTN Radio Corporation, "" The fire broke out in Jecheon "" on October 22. And isn't it the year 2017 and this year that the London apartment fire broke out globally? I don`t think measures are going well on here even though it was a problem at the time.The 2015 Uijeongbu apartment fire in Gyeonggi-do caught fire in a parking lot on the first floor quickly caught fire with a dry-bit exterior wall. Five people died and 125 were injured in the fire. The cause of the June 14 Grenfell Tower fire in London, England, was the use of cheap, flammable insulation. At 1:00 a.m., a fire broke out on the fourth floor of the Grenfell Tower apartment on the 24th floor, and the fire covered the entire area with an outer wall of the building in just 15 minutes. The fire was recorded as a major disaster that ended up killing 79 people and injuring 18. ▽ The most complex way to escape from sports center building in Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province, is like a big tunnel in case of emergency The building, which has a parking lot on the first floor, a bath on the second and third floors, a fitness center on the fourth and seventh floors, and an eight-story restaurant, was probably damaged due to its complicated construction and highly toxic fumes. Some firefighters who set out to search said, I had a hard time searching because of the maze of internal structures. Another firefighter said through a media, The problem is that the car parked in front of the only entrance caught fire. The escape route is completely blocked, said a senior prosecutor. Some residents were quoted as saying, Because of the complicated structure, whenever I used the sauna regularly, I felt like I would be in a big trouble if the fire started. Firefighters carried out a search on the building site of Jecheon Sports Center in North Chungcheong Province, where 29 people were killed in the blaze on July 21. / The flames caught fire at the corner of Yonhap news agency ③ and the PilottI structure caught fire very quickly. Experts point out that fire and smoke from the parking lot of the building on the first floor, which is made of pilotis, could have blocked passage from the second floor, causing casualties. Jeong Sang-man, professor of construction and environmental engineering at Kongju University, said in a radio interview on July 22, "" The construction of a building with the Filoty structure is problematic, "" and a second is the construction of a pilotis. "" It was said that the structure was wide under the passage, and since the stairs were narrow, when the fire broke out, the structure was exposed to be very fast in the event of an earthquake, "" Jeong said. Ambulance drivers are moving to the scene of a fire at the fitness center in Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province yesterday. ▽ Combined news = The first time fire department that lost its hold on the scene arrived at the scene after seven minutes of reporting, but it was hard to control the fire due to the heavy traffic surrounding sports center. In addition, the oyster car, which had only one car on the ground, did not get properly laid out. Several media outlets have also claimed that "" the person trapped inside the building talked to the outside world over the phone for more than an hour, but the rescue failed. "" When I checked the body of the deceased wife, her fingerprints were missing, said Ryu Hyo-mo, 59, bereaved of the family. Perhaps my hands were badly damaged as I tried to break a window in a sauna. When you were shouting for help in the sauna and struggling desperately to break through the windows, you were only spraying water outside, said Ryu. It was only 30 to 40 minutes after the actual fire department team reached the second floor of the building. By this time, 20 people had already died in the flames. When the fire engine arrived on the scene, the first floor of the fire engine was burned, there was a risk of a possible explosion of LP gas nearby, and it was difficult to get into the fire station, said Lee Sang-min, chief of Jecheon Fire Station.On July 22, Moon Jae-in, Jecheon-si, Chungbuk, Korea is president a sports center, and fire damage for the site of the reports on follow-up measures and ordered.▶ subscription channel Asian economies, ▶ 'Military talk' # # in the press hsg@asiae.co.kr ▶ yangnakkyu hanseunggon < © 5 Kits combine an eye the Windows of the world economy the Asian economy, Asia's economies.Deployment ban unauthorized war damage > the law of the land to … Among those protesting against the one parliamentary seat in the election for a sentence (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) Han Ji Hoon Journalist : Supreme Court decision to end their Among those selected.""Park Geun-hye's political force charges of charges by state prosecutors have targeted the political arena who was appointed by Lee Myung-bak administration guilty to"" of 22 former yunjongo.Argued.

"▽ There are many misunderstanding about royalties ... 〓 As the noise regulations on the life of department stores over 3000 ㎡ and large discount stores were imposed on them, it is hard to listen to carols ' songs and post them on their own. The year-end atmosphere is gloomy and even bleak. The public's tastes have changed and the culture of listening alone has become more established than listening and sharing. I feel like running in the snow. Don't cry. Santa says he won't give the crying children gifts out of the window. Look out the window. It is a long time since memories were kept warm by boosting the year-end sentiment to the full and recalling the memories of the past. Office worker Kim Hee-soo (alias · 32) said, "" I am very sorry to feel like I have lost my innocence. "" Netizens responded similarly to Carroll as a result of a search for portals. "" I miss the carols I used to hear in my old street tape store, "" she said. "" It's sad to see that the romance is gone. I was happy ... "" "" But I don't want to go to the end of the year and I want to listen to Carroll while I'm on the road. "" Why did Carroll disappear from the streets? ■ Misconception about royalties and the truth is, "" An area of 3000 ㎡ or less "" is considered to be a lack of royalties for many people. As confirmed by the Culture and Sports Council and the Korea Music Copyright Association, the cost of low work varies depending on the size of the business establishment. According to Article 12 of the Regulation on the Collection of Non-Proprietary Taxes, department stores and large discount stores with an area of 3000 ㎡ (approximately 907 pyeong or more) are subject to collection. In other words, coffee shops and pub owners under 3000 ㎡ can not get royalties for their work. An official at the Korean Music Copyright Association said, "" Music from a store is considered to be a "" performance fee. "" But a large store or department store should not pay royalties from the "" performance fee. "" However, the revised copyright law will apply from the second half of next year, which will increase the amount of collection. Shops smaller than 3,000 ㎡, including coffee shops and bars, that have been excluded from the collection of royalties so far, will also pay for the work. A 15-pyong to 30-pyong apartment will cost 4,000 won per month, 7,200 won for a 60-pyeong store, and 20,000 won for a 300-pyeong store. However, traditional markets and small stores with a capacity of less than 50 ㎡ (15 pyeong) can continue to sing carols without a fee. ■ The government's standards on living noise regulations also affected carols based on the limited limit of restriction, and based on the standard of up to 65 dB per day and 60 dB per night. Life noise regulations refer to regulations on noise and vibration generated by businesses and construction sites to keep residents in a temperate living environment according to the Noise Vibrations and Management Act. Regulation says businesses located in residential areas should stay at 50 ㏈ per day and 40 ㏈ per night. When speaker and speakers are installed outside, they shall be kept to a standard of 65 dB per day and 60 dB per night. If they exceed the threshold, they will be fined up to 3 million won. Considering that our daily conversation volume is 60mm, our telephone ring tone is 70mm, and our subway noise is 80KB, even when we put in speakers outside, we can not play carols very loudly. Moreover, another reason why people can not hear carols in the streets is that the regulations on heating and opening have been enforced since 2014. Another reason is that the number of carols albums that were released in December due to changes in popular tastes and popularity on music charts has decreased dramatically. In the past, not only singers, actors and comedians used to release albums for Christmas, but recently only big planners or influential singers have recorded albums sometimes. This year, few other singers than Taeyeon have found a prominent Christmas album. The arrival of seasonal songs has also had an influence. The public prefers songs that inspire winter sentiments to carols confined to Christmas. KAPP officials said the music charts have been reorganized with powerful singers for a long time, as the reason why carols have declined in number of songs in recent years is because they are unpopular. Experts point out that the development of technologies such as smartphones and Bluetooth speakers is another reason why Carroll disappeared. Professor Gil Chang-wook of Seoul Cyber University said, "" I used to have a lot of analogue emotion to listen to and share with you, but now I have established the tradition of hearing alone with my own emotion and tastes through earphones as an easy way of letting people know that I am in winter. "" # TIP! Is that a carol or a carol? According to the National Academy of Korean Language, ' Carroll is right. ' Most people tend to say or write in "" carols "" because of "" o "" in "" carol, "" but it becomes "" carols when the original pronunciation is written in accordance with an loanwords accent. "" hyuk7179@fnnews.com Last week's report, "" Noble Fitness Spa "" in Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province, was concentrated in the women's sauna room on the second floor. Among the 29 dead, 20 people were found dead on the second floor alone. Jecheon Fire Station Chief Lee Sang-min announced on July 22 that 11 people were found at the main entrance to the sauna room on the second floor, along with the sliding doors, and found nine others at the lounge and changing room. According to the plan of the women's sauna lounge on the second floor, it has sliding doors that start from the central entrance door and go inside. A staircase that parks on the first floor and then rises to correspond to the main entrance. Inside the main entrance gate is the lounge, the women's locker room, and the yellow clay room. About half of the second floor were designed as bathrooms. Common bathyard structure There is an elevator to the 8th floor at the main entrance of Jecheon Sports Center in North Chungcheong Province. There is also a freight elevator next to it. Firefighters believe smoke spread throughout the building through the main entrance on the second floor after a fire started at the parking lot on the first floor. Lee said, Smoke from the first floor came through the main entrance to the sauna room on the second floor. Because of this, the sauna lounge people have difficulty getting out of sight and suffocated to death. The second floor had three external roads, but the deaths were reported to have been driven to the main entrance, which was frequently visited by fire. At the edge of the second floor, there was an emergency exit running up and down stairs, and an elevator in the middle. Chief Lee said, "" I believe they were driving through the main entrance that the passengers used to enter, but were choked by smoke. "" "" The emergency stairs were remote, so it was hard to confirm, "" and "" the next elevator wasn't clear. That is why many bodies were found between sliding doors in the main entrance and fire doors. Some argue that the sliding door on the second floor did not work properly, causing huge damages. Mr. A, who had worked long hours at the fire sports center, told Yonhap, "" The victim's concentrated access to the second floor bath did not open a large, automatic door the size of a nail would not have been opened properly. "" The fire site at Jecheon Sports Center also said, "" The stairs to each floor were not fire-prevention, so the smoke and flames spread quickly, leaving fire sprinklers in the building in the area vulnerable to fire. "" Regarding the cause of the fire, however, an analysis showed that the fire flared up during the construction of the pilotis, and he said, "" I saw the repair work being carried out on the first floor of the accident.

"- Two nurses - Chief Nurses and Pharmacist will be summoned at 2:00 p.m. - Hospital officials were summoned to investigate the intensive care system of new-born intensive care units of intensive care patients at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency announced on July 22 that it is investigating a nurse who is currently in charge of the intensive care unit of newborns and a pharmacy pharmacist as a witness for the case. Police will concentrate their investigation on the drug preparation process, the drug delivery process for infant intensive care units, and the intensive care unit management system for infants of intensive care units nurses. Police also analyzed a vast number of electronic medical mandatory records obtained from the search and seizure at the hospital, collecting basic data to determine whether there had been medical errors during the medical team's procedure.Regarding the suspicion that the new children showed symptoms such as a low fever and swelling in their abdomen from the early morning of the incident and the medical team failed to properly deal with the situation, a police official said, If the cause of the dispute is confirmed, a Korean medical advisor.Police said four newborns who were being treated at an intensive care unit in the hospital were subsequently treated and started an investigation from 9:31 p.m. on July 16.say@heraldcorp.com Other liquids degrade in solids. International Joint research team at Pohang University of Technology and the Swedish Stockholm University explained why the water gave rise to such a characteristic by using the fourth generation radiation accelerator (PAL-CREL) in Pohang. Pohang 4th generation radiation accelerator accelerates electrons near the speed of light to create the world's highest level x-ray laser flash in 2015. The results of the first research by the Pohang Accelerator, were published in the latest issue of the International Journal of Scientific Studies. Water increases in volume as the temperature falls below 4 ℃. There exists a theory that the water may be due to structural changes, but it can not be documented by experiments. It is difficult to measure the structure of water, which is measured in femtosecond seconds. Researchers were able to measure the structure of the water molecules before the water was determined into ice with the Four-Generation Radiographer in Pohang, which was able to see changes in the units of femtosecond. Analysis shows that there are two slightly different water molecules. The difference became even more stark when it formed a "" mass, "" a mixture of water molecules. The larger the mass containing the longer the longer the more mass, the smaller the density, and the smaller the number the shorter the molecule, the higher the density. A proportion of long molecules increases below 4 ℃. Therefore, when it becomes ice, it increases in volume rather than in volume. Researchers also say that when vacuum reaches minus 44 ℃, the two types of molecules would exist at the same rate. Park Yong-jun, director of planning at the Institute of Acceleration at Pohang University of Science and Technology, said, We will disclose the secret of the water, which has been in hiding for about a century, as our accelerator. We failed to finally reveal the structure of the water in the fourth generation of the U.S. and Japan, which were created before Pohang Accelerator, he added. Choi Won-ho, a major public research officer at the Ministry of Science and Technology and Information, said, "" The Pohang radiolocator will continue to contribute to discovering natural phenomena that have not been revealed yet. "" "" The government's creative idea has helped researchers realize that. "" A picture of dense water molecules (red) and low-density water molecules (blue).
