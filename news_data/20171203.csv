[Report : Korea (news1.kr), Untrusted and redistributed-redistributed] Rescue boats from the Incheon Fishing Port accident (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) crashed into a rescue boat and crashed into a fishing boat two mile offshore at Yeongheung Bridge, Ongjin City, Incheon yesterday morning [Incheon Coast Guard Planchange=Conference news : photo@yna.co.kr Cold water and strong water currents are not likely to survive, hard to spot, and 13 dead and only seven of the 22 missing sea boats are sinking during the accident. A rescue team composed of Coast Guard, Navy and fire department is searching for the two missing sailors. Kang Jong-gu, a reporter at Incheon news agency, reported that the fishing boat accident in Incheon's Yeongheung Island was the most fatal accident since the rollover of Dolgorae Lake in 2015.A fishing boat collided with a tanker and was overturned two miles south of Yeongheung Bridge in Incheon on July 3. The photo shows a voyage on the boat's pier. The accident resulted in 13 deaths and two missing out of 22 passengers on the first dock. The other seven are being rescued and treated at a hospital.[Graphic] The worst accident involving a fishing boat from Yeongheungdo Island in Incheon was the sinking of a fishing boat by a fishing boat called Dolgorae (9.07t) in September 2015 in waters off Chuja Island. At that time, 15 people were killed and three were missing. The reason why the water supply on the harbor No.1 was so terrible was due to the strong currents in the area and the cold temperatures in the winter.Starting 15 minutes after receiving reports of the sinking of the nation's major ferry and fishing boat, rescue workers, including Coast Guard helicopters and patrol boats, arrived on the scene and most fishermen wore life vests, but winter water temperatures showed cold improvement. In addition, the strong currents found in remote areas and not directly at the site of the accident made fishing travelers even more vulnerable to human casualties.The first pier collided with each other nine minutes after leaving Jindu Port in Ongjin, Yeongheung-do at 6 a.m. Although the weather was favorable at the time, it was reported that the accident occurred when the first and the refueling ships were passing through a narrow waterway below Yeongheung Bridge.When the ferry sank, the pier was packed with 20 passengers and had an accident. The Coast Guard said, "" We did not violate the garden regulations, "" adding, "" The port number 1 reported leaving the port as normal prior to departure.

So it was revealed that the boat had more people inside, so now it would be a scene of the Coast Guard arriving and performing rescue operations.[Interview] Okay. [Anchor] We can see that the rescue has been carried out in a very critical situation.

When you go to work, you pick the place you want to sit every day. A table for four is basically unpartitioned. Of course, there are no fixed phones or drawers, because they use different places every time. Since they could not store the documents, they were less natural.

Hey is a key word in Japanese society, and the word "" work-reformed reform "" has become the buzzword of the year 2017. After the suicide of Denz, a renowned advertising agency, in December 2015, many people called for a shift in the Japanese way of working. A discussion was held on whether to replace the symbol of Japanese salaried workers ' late nights, mountain of paper, and the deadly commuter subway. Graphic : journalist Park Chun-hwan also wrote on the social scene of low fertility rates and a shortage of workers of 1.46 children in 2015. The working class is getting smaller and less efficient and less productive. Japan ranked 21st lowest among 28 countries in the Productivity Center survey in 2015. That is why Prime Minister Shinzo Abe personally took the initiative to reform the way he works. Itochu, the best and most productive company to work for this year, is allowed to leave for work from 5 a.m. Instead, they provided breakfast for free and the same pay as when they were working late. I merely moved my attendance time forward and the results were substantial. The number of working hours decreased by 30 percent to 5 percent after 8 p.m. and by 15 percent during the same period.

[photo = the Mainichi newspaper agency yesterday,] - ""reduced salary"" complaints, he shall ... work force 'to Chita.' only newly coined words, but also formidable backlash from laborers in the process. Once the working hours are cut, there is a great deal of resistance to the pay reduction. In addition, there is a situation in which the number of working hours are forced to be shortened, even though the number of work hours has not decreased. As a government agency, we are pushing for ` reform of the way we work ` first, but it is rather stressful not to reduce the number of hours we have to go home. This has led to the origin of the word ‘ Zidane, ’ which forces the reduction of time. In the private sector, some are even moving to change the way people are judged. Interprenetal executives have boldly disposed of the traditional "" wage table "" of working hours and experience. Instead of diversifying working conditions such as working hours and whether they were home, they actively adopted the concept of marketability in their wage system. For example, for 30-year-old programmer who works at home three times a week, the salary standard depends only on his marketability and how much he should suggest to bring him home. However, this is not always good for employees. "" In a sense, it promotes the gap, "" said Ioano Yoshihisa, president of Cybos. We need to work together to improve the social security system.

"Lee Sang-seo, a reporter and actress (Kim Jeong-mi) died at the age of 57. Police, who attended an off-the-scene report on July 28 at an office-testing office building in southern Seoul, found him dead two weeks ago. A man in his 50s was found dead in a rented apartment in Mapo-gu, Seoul on the same day. According to the police, he lived alone and was in poor financial condition. There is a history of solitude in which people who live alone die before anyone else knows it. It is because of the continuous increase in the number of single-person households, separation from family or neighbors, and financial hardship. In particular, it has been revealed recently that middle-aged men in their 50s are more likely to develop the disease than older men.The death of a lone couple or a lone family member was found abandoned after dying alone. It is the meaning of the history of solitude by the Seoul Welfare Foundation. There is no official definition of solitude. Therefore, there are no administrative statistics. However, a similar administrative term is "" non-activated death "". Non-dollar death means ' death without family or acquaintances to receive the body '. It does not perfectly coincide with solitude, because it may be useful even when alone. According to data received from 17 municipal and provincial governments by Chung Chun-sook, the number of people who died without violence has increased. In 2013, 1,666 people died without any relationship, but the following year, the number increased by nearly 100. In 2016, 1,496 people died. This year, 970 people, already 65 percent of them, were born last June. Even more so when it comes to the presumed deaths of solitude. The Seoul Welfare Foundation said in its report last year that as of 2013, it has had 12,202 suspicions about the history of solitude in the nation. The only reason I feel lonely is because I don't have anyone around me. Dr. Lee Ho-seon, head of the Center for Elderly Care in Korea, attributed the increase in solitude to the loss of cohesion, as the rise of single-person households, the break in the household community and social networks. Social networks become narrower with age. According to the National Statistical Office's social survey report released last month, the older you are, the more difficult you are, the more help you have. 89.1 percent of those in their 20s answered that they needed someone to talk to because they were depressed or depressed, the highest among their age groups. However, the number of children aged between 40 and 50 starts to grow rapidly and falls to 75.6 percent when they are 60 or older. The number of people who can get help also decreases to 2.4. The percentage of people in their 20s who also answered, "" If you're sick and need help with your home "" was the highest at 84.7 percent. However, it decreases with age and goes down to 74.8 percent in the 50s.The people who are vulnerable to lonely history are the elderly in their 50s. The Seoul Welfare Foundation analyzed 343 cases of solitude that occurred in Seoul in 2013 (cases of cases of real or suspected cases of 2,281), and found that people in their 50s were the highest percentage (524). That means more than one out of five people who met with lonely deaths were middle-aged people in their 50s. It is higher than 70 (385) or 60 (368). Men are overwhelming when analyzed by sex. 84.6 % of all cases of safe solitude are men. Even when compared to the distribution of population by age group, the percentage of people in their 50s who die in solitude is high. According to the Seoul Metropolitan Government's demographic statistics, the people in their 50s were the third largest population at the same time, after those in their 30s (1.173,451) and 40s (178,953). However, the number of deaths from solitude is more than twice that of people in their 30s. It is more than five times larger than the similar age group of people in their 20s (1,149,843). That means that it is not because of the large population. Dr. Lee Ho-seon said, It is an error to interpret solitude as many people are simply in their 50s. "" The baby boomer generation has frequently been born since the beginning of the past, but I don't see it as a single time when middle-aged people have told me that there are only about as many cases of solitude as there are today, "" he said. Dr. Lee Ho-seon said, "" I was more vulnerable to socio-economic changes due to early retirement, divorce, and health problems that middle-aged men could experience, "" and added, "" The emotional difficulties that led to their adjustment. "" Lee added, Living alone is controlled by a system that includes visits to homes or support from the government, but the middle-aged are not interested. The threat of middle-aged men is also felt at the scene. While most of the middle-aged social workers in their 30s, who have been working in Seoul for seven years in an area where solitude often occurs, were considered elderly people who "" had lost touch with the outside world until recently, "" they said. He went on to say, "" Older adults have improved to some extent due to their constant management of home visits and government vouchers in the past. "" On the other hand, middle-aged people are still somewhat more interested. Compared to the elderly, who are generally considered to be underprivileged in society, this is not the case for middle-aged people. One social worker, who is financially strapped or worried about safety, says, "" I don't think there are a lot of super-absorbing problems in this age group, so I don't think there's anything wrong with me or I can take care of myself when I can get people to live in the world. ""Photo : I Click Art Japan, who experienced an isolation death earlier than Korea, is proposing various support measures and measures. Last year, there were 17,333 cases of solitude in Japan. That is 3.5 percent of the total deaths. But Britain's Independent reported on July 1 that "" the number of lonely deaths in Japan would reach 30,000 per year, much higher than the official announcement. "" In Japan, postmen and gas meter readers report to people who worry about becoming lonely, and they also run a counseling window. It also expands the Collective house, which is designed to let people of different ages live in the same area and share bathroom, laundry, and other spaces. In early 2003, when it was first introduced, people in their 50s and 60s lived alone, but more and more generations moved in and lived in groups. Some lonely insurance companies are paying for the repair and post-processing costs of living alone and dying. We are not without measures to prevent solitude. Yangcheon-gu in Seoul announced in March that it has launched the Nabi 男 Project, which supports males living alone in their 50s. Other services include basic services for senior citizens to ensure their safety and provide emotional support regularly, and funeral services for senior citizens who can live alone without medical care in the event of death in the event of non-smoking or aged living alone.

PetroChina said the store is much larger than the previous rock field found in the U.S. and Brazil. Sales of Grade 3 oil are estimated to be 1.14 billion tons, of which 500 million tons have been confirmed. This is quite a large story because it obtained another kidney caramye, or 克 瑪 (拉 依) gene, which was first discovered in China in 1955. PetroChina confirmed that it has continued to upgrade its resource exploration technology since 2005 and confirmed that it produces petroleum from its retro-calculation layer oil theory, along with its sodium-rich source rocks and delta deposits.

"A reproduction of the public institute is being held at the National Assembly Hall in Yeouido on September 28, 2016 to criticize the residential reality of young people. I packed the eighth of my removal from the Congressman Kim Hyun-ah's office. Still, there were many new ones for the move. It is the first time that a car has been called to move, and the first time it has a toilet that can only be used by itself. The last seven moves have been carried by hand in a junkyard. It was possible to live alone with a simple living. Goh (31), who works as a contract worker for a public institution, recalled the days when he used to carry belongings while moving a cart. "" I used to move in with plastic film to move on a rainy day, but when I moved to the top of the hill, I didn't even have time to buy anything. "" And when he did, he and my friend and I weren't even able to get our car to go up the hill until the end of the hill. The reason he left the public lecture hall on the hilltop until recently was not because he felt better, but because the public service was shut down when the neighborhood started to redevelop. The new multiplex houses are about 13 ㎡, or 4 pyeong in size. It is just below the minimum residential area of 14 ㎡. In a single room, there is a sink that is hardly even called a kitchen, and a washing machine that has to share the sink drain is inside. There is a bathroom, but if you sit on the left side of the toilet, you can not help but feel small enough to bring your knee to the wall. Still, it is inspiring for Koh to come to a place where she can use the bathroom and cooking area alone. When I was in college or working part-time, I could not come up with a deposit that would cost me a fortune. Even when I work now, it took almost three years to collect the deposit because I paid off my student loans. "" I'm still sure when it will be hard for Ko to live in a house that exceeds the minimum residential standards.Koh left her hometown of Jeonju in North Jeolla Province and started her first living in Seoul in dorm. As for university dormitories, the price of room itself was cheaper than boardinghouse nearby universities, but the problem was narrow. Four people each used a bunk bed with a desk under it. But I decided to stay at home after I came out of the dorm because of money rather than money. Although it is difficult to prepare meals at dorm restaurants every time, I had to make sure to pay regularly, so I moved to a nearby public relations officer to save money. It was Ko's first move, and while adding the same number of moves since then, Ko moved in turn to a semi-basement room and a public office.The director's trajectory of Kim Eun-beom (28), Cho's junior college student, is similar to that of Ko. Kim followed the route of going to and from underground to the rooftop room and public affairs officer. As a result, it is not surprising that the poor housing conditions are affected, whether it is rooftop or underground. Even Kim could not endure any more, and the public office room that was released after only four months was so small that he could not even fit in the smallest bed. "" I could adapt myself to sleeping on the floor without a bed, even in the military living room, because the only thing I could hear at daybreak was the hall of my hired men walking by my bedside was the monthly rent of 16 grand. "" For Kim, public rental housing provided by the government or local governments was merely a pie in the sky. It was a much cheaper rent than the nearby market, but was not that much of an eye for the poor.Kim had filed for rental apartments, which were bought by local governments and then rented at a cheap price to underprivileged people. At the time, the wall office of the manager of the apartment had to meet the minimum residential standards because the bathroom was shared by tenants of the basement floor. After confirming that he was eligible to apply at the community center, Kim submitted an application and won the prize, but had to give up the apartment. There was no way to provide more than 14 million won in security. The reality of the ' Minimum Housing Standards ', which must be borne due to the lack of housing costs, is out of the question around. A dwelling that meets the minimum residential standards set out in the Enforcement Rules of the Housing Act is a house with a dedicated entrance kitchen, a dedicated flush toilet, and bath facility with a certain area. The size needed depends on the number of people in the household, such as a single person household with a total residential area of at least 14 ㎡ and a 2-person household with a total housing area of at least 26 ㎡. The lowest housing standards are estimated to be 5.4 million households, but the non-inclusive housing levels, such as public officials and private housing, are not classified as housing levels 12 percent.Passers-in-law pass by a shoppingbox in an alley in Daehak-dong, Gwanak-gu, Seoul. / Kim Ki-nam, a journalist at the Seoul Youth Center, failed to meet the legal minimum residential standards, but Sharehouse is the most popular form of housing among youths. A single household can rent an apartment or a detached house based on the assumption that several people live in. In some cases, private businesses have raised tenants for new housing rental projects while raising lenders in the form of cooperatives to make up for rental rates that are not individually affordable. Yang Hee-young (29), who applied to enter a sharehouse run by a company, hopes that she will be given a chance to move in under the guidance of an average competition of 4-1.Yang's eyes on the sharehouse are mixed. Yang was most welcome to a recommendation that his friend, who first entered the sharehouse, was safe. "" One day, on my friend's way into the sharehouse, I saw someone follow me. When I came in and told the people I was living with, they asked me to go out with them. As they rush out, the guy in the corner runs away, and then says, "" I don't know if I can relate to the inconveniences of living alone as a woman, "" says Yang.Another reason why Yang hopes to live in a sharehouse is that it does not burden him financially. Yang currently lives in a studio apartment in Seoul with a rent of 400,000 won. If you compare electricity, water, gas, and other public utilities and administrative costs to housing costs, it would be no burden to move to Sharehouse. Yang said, "" If you take a smaller room, you can use your living room and kitchen widely, and you can use a more commoned home instead of paying to replace your old home appliances. ""Although Sharehouse is rapidly emerging as a solution to the problem of rental housing in densely populated areas, such as the Seoul Metropolitan area, there are many problems to be solved. The most common problem is that the current legal concept and the reality of the sharehouse play separately. This is because the housing classification under the Building Act is limited to the proprietary-centered concepts of single-housing apartments and apartments. For home owners who rent a house, having only one owner puts them at a disadvantage as they are classified as luxury houses because they have a larger area to rent them. On the other hand, as multiple owners of an apartment must register for each, the owners are considered multiple home owners, resulting in a tax disadvantage.Some say that the government needs to improve the sharehouse, especially because it runs counter to the current minimum residential standards. Sharehouse, which aims to make full use of shared space in the living room, kitchen, and bathroom, can be seen as a residential form that falls short of the current minimum residential standards. However, experts point out that it is urgent to supplement the system because it is more inefficient to have individual restrooms and kitchens all by person or household, according to the minimum residential standards. "" I'm sorry to say that the government's roadmap for residential welfare includes the supply of sharehouses, so I don't expect anything to go through with fixing the system in the future, "" said an official of one sharehouse rental social company. The official said, "" To increase the supply of sharehouses, the supply of sharehouses will not proceed very quickly, as architectural law requires consideration of a variety of factors, including parking lots, floor space rates, and mixed applications.The purpose of using part of the housing space for public use is not so strange, actually. From the days when they rent in a doorway to boarding houses and public restrooms, they shared the kitchen and bathroom were designed to maximize cost-effectiveness. However, some senior citizens who are relatively liable to experience health problems say that the shared housing has an unexpected effect of checking in with each other.The principle of sharing found in the Sharehouse is also a minimal safety net for some residents. Chang Il-goo, 82, a grandfather, has lived without a family for over 20 years. Jang, who lived in the nearby dankang, moved to the nearby dancang room when the neighborhood was rebuilt in Singye-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul, and moved to Dohwa-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul, when he was demolished. And because of the nature of the town where the skyscrapers are built differently every day, I do not know when to leave the basement where I live. "" Well, I could die first and go to the body, "" Jang laughed, saying, "" I've lived long enough. I don't even care to die. ""However, the cold bone floor of the room Jang stays in was not conducive to good health. Especially around November before the actual cold hit, he has the hardest season. If it is the middle of winter, one can get a shot in the arm from coal in the past, and now receive a small amount of heating. Until then, however, he had little help. The center is visited by social workers and neighbors who live next door but spends most of their time alone. The most dreadful thing for Jang is to be discovered long after she passed away. "" How much trouble it is for the landlord and the neighbors. So I've been trying to get my head rolled around. "" The idea was to hang a string from a window in the corridor that the next tenant was with. If you lose power and fall, you're at home."
"The string that I had tied while I was around made the window open by pulling. A tenant living next door, Choi (61), said, As my family is away during the day, I don`t know what happened, but I could see my grandfather's window in the evening when I went to the bathroom. The structure of the old ladies ' room is playing a minimum role in preventing the solitude of elderly.Moon Jae-in integrated project schedule is housing policy that will push the government's term residential welfare/environment roadmap is Jang A Socio-Architectural Study for the most vulnerable, such as the elderly and young people, including a grandfather.Also presented to custom policies. Experts also agreed on the need to provide housing for emergency rental housing and housing benefits for low-income people who have lost their homes. Meanwhile, some say measures need to be supplemented, such as the Sharehouse policy for the elderly or young, and the ' affordable housing. ' In particular, affordable housing can be combined with sharehouse sharing, creating a greater synergy effect. Costable housing, also referred to as affordable housing, is a affordable housing that can be realistically charged at each class's economic level, encompassing low-income households and those who experience housing problems. In particular, the concept of providing enhanced housing in terms of quality, at a reasonable cost, is inserted into providing a stronger residential welfare. This could include more extended welfare, such as that of Chang, who wishes to avoid becoming a solitary temple, and Yamgil, who wishes to protect himself from the dead. Jeon Eun-ho, director of the Center for Citizen Assentialization and Freedom, said, "" As the government's low-price housing discussion held at the National Assembly, the goals of the policies on housing policies have to be raised from public rental to public rental to public rental to public rental to affordable housing ownership, "" adding to an affordable level.< journalist Kim Tae-hoon anarq@kyunghyang.com> [Twitter] (www.khan.co.kr), [Popular free cartoons] 1.1.1 Seoul and Redistribution Inc=Newsis and Forbes ' latest generation of mobile phones, ○○, and Apple's latest column, smartphones, ○○ According to industry sources on November 3, Forbes posted an "" As Undetered "" rating of LG pyeongga0's LG V0, which was over-represented by amateur photographer Ben Sin on November 27. In a column published in Forbes, Ben Shin compared designs and cameras, saying, "" We are comparing them with others for the purpose of helping us choose our customers. "" The analysis shows that Ben Shin has described the design of the iPhone X as ' an ugly camera sticking out from the back, ' whereas the overall camera is not sticking out from any other premium product, whereas the V0 camera is. LG Electronics ' V0 design is evaluated to have been implemented with a bezel lease that minimizes the right and left bezels. Meanwhile, some in the industry are saying that the convenience of the notch design applied on the iPhone X is different. In addition, when comparing the camera, iPhone X was able to take a balanced and quality picture, and in the case of the 300, it supported an analysis by supporting expert mode when taking photos and video. In addition, he stressed that with a 120-degree wide view camera, one can take scenes that are difficult to take with other mobile phones while revealing the pictures taken with the ES30.

At the time of the accident, 22 people, including two crew members and 20 passengers, were on board. All 17 people were found and transported to land, but eight were killed, five were unconscious, seven survived, and two others were missing. Three of the rescuers were trapped in an overturned vessel and could not get out after the boat was overturned, but fortunately, they got out safely with a cell phone call from rescue personnel and an occasional call.The fishing boat was launched from Jindu port in Yeongheungdo, Ongjing-gun, Incheon at 6 a.m. and had an accident. The report was made by a customer on a fishing boat. Maritime police do not rule out the possibility that passengers were swept away from the site of the accident because of the strong currents in the affected areas.Maritime police dispatched 14 vessels and 4 helicopters to the affected areas and continued rescue and search.As the boat sank to low water, the stern of the boat was reportedly perched on a mud flat."
"According to the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, the biggest full moon of the year, Super Moon, is coming up on December 4. Compared to the smallest looking ' Minimun ' on June 9, it looks about 14 percent bigger and is expected to be 30 percent brighter. The moon is most visible at 0:47 a.m. on the 4th, which is expected to allow you to see the supermoon past midnight if the weather conditions are good.There is something special about Super Moon?Supermoon, or supermoon, is a large, bright full moon that appears when the moon is closest to Earth. The reason why the Moon looks different in size is because it is orbiting the Earth in an elliptical orbit. When the distance between the Earth and the moon is near, the moon looks big, and when it is far away, it looks small.There are two reasons why this full moon looks big. It is the day when the Moon and the Earth and the Sun are on the day line, and the moon and the Earth are closest in distance.The closest time the Earth and the moon are to each other is called the perigee. The moon passes through the moon's perigee 12 times a year, but not every time a supermoon appears. This is because there is a difference between the cycles at which the Moon passes through the perigee and the cycles at the full moon. When the two cycles are completed, the full Moon passes through the perigee, called the supermoon."" The cycles that the moon takes as it moves around the Earth in an elliptical orbit are approximately 27.56 days.The cycle of changing from a full moon to the next full moon is about 29.5 days. Because the two cycles are different, it is inevitable that the frequency of a full moon to return to the perigee is irregular. That's why supermoon happens every year in other months : "" ■ 30 % brighter, "" can I see it with my eyes?The supermoon, Earth and Moon, has a distance of about 357,623 kilometers on July 4, which is more than 30,000 kilometers closer than the Earth's average distance of 384,400 kilometers. On June 9, when the moon looked smallest, the distance between the Earth and the moon was about 406,399 kilometers, more than 20,000 kilometers above average.Supermoon is said to be about 13 to 14 percent larger and 30 percent brighter than the circumpolar full Moon and Earth, the most distant of the Earth. However, even when a supermoon is opened, it is not easy to tell the difference in size and brightness with your eyes. Because when you look at it in real life, it depends on the weather conditions, the location of the observer, and so on."" The physical distance between the Moon and the Earth is getting closer on the day of its rise, "" the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute said. "" But it can also explain how big the Moon is actually, and how big the atmosphere and subjective parts can be. ""■ Earthquake, tsunami supermoon? No scientific evidence found ... In fact, astronomy uses the term apogee instead of supermoon. Supermoon was coined by an American astrologer in 1979. At the time, he used the supermoon to mean ' a big moon that was a disaster. ' Was it because of the negative meaning of astrology? There is also a myth that supermoon is a harbinger of disaster.Conventional wisdom has it about earthquakes and cyclones before or after a supermoon. Back in 1974, a cyclone hit the Darwin region in Australia, just before the super gate. In 2005, a tsunami hit Indonesia two weeks before the supermoon hit, and in 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake hit East Japan and hit the supermoon two weeks later.But academics say there is no connection between the supermoon and natural disasters. The time of the supermoon rise and the time of natural disasters just coincided. However, care should be taken when the supermoon is raised to avoid flooding in lowlands, as the moon's gravity will increase the sea level and the difference between the tides.Regarding the myth that supermoon causes natural disasters, such as earthquakes and volcanic activity, an official at the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute said, "" The Earth and Moon could have been involved in natural disasters, such as earthquakes, "" the statement suggests that "" but the difference between the distances between the Earth and the Moon could have been justified.

Such comments by the Russian daily People's Daily, Huangu, reflect China's negative view of sanctions against North Korea against North Korea following the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) at the end of last month. The People's Republic of Korea's United Nations Security Council has guaranteed sanctions by China as one of the few nations that have acted in favor of North Korea, and the Security Council has repeatedly urged North Korea to take sanctions against it. The newspaper also said China has done enough against the United States and that China has already paid the price in the implementation of the Security Council resolution, including damages to its relations with China. The paper also pointed out that although the North Korean nuclear issue should go into dialogue along with sanctions, the U.S. and South Korea ignored it and relies solely on China to solve the nuclear issue. The newspaper said, "" As the Korean Peninsula crisis enters a new phase, the pressure on China is growing, but the U.S. and North Korea both say they can not take responsibility for what they have done, and China should take responsibility for it.

"Incheon ferry collision / wreck / life jacket all 11 people with the worst accident / deaths since the incident in 2015 (Cause of disasterdisarmative incident / collision / landing on or near the low water temperature / tanker captain / patrol boat landing craft). Officials at the Maritime Police Agency told The Daily yesterday, Of course, most ships, except small fishing boats, should have early morning radar that checks the direction of their neighboring vessels, adding they have little visibility at all times. If the survivors are combined to date, they may have not been properly seen by tankers or fishing boats, and there may have been problems with the radar.Seo (37), a fisherman's survivor, said, I could see a boat lights in the back, but in less than a minute something appeared in the dark, and I was attacked by the stern on the left of the boat. It can not happen if the radar is properly observed.Incheon Coast Guard arrested the oil tanker's captain Myeongjin, 37, and the deck crew member Kim, 46, on suspicion of professional negligence resulting in death. The Coast Guard learned from Jeon that the fishing boat was operating at close range and received a statement to acknowledge its mistake.Therefore, the Korea Coast Guard is planning to secure evidence of negligence such as the vessel's navigation system (PPP). A fishing boat is sinking after crashing into a tanker two miles south of Yeongheung Bridge in Ongjing-gun, Incheon yesterday. A rescue team composed of Coast Guard, Navy and fire department is searching for the two missing sailors.View of the inside of the accident vessel. Rescue workers are working on the accident sea.It looks as if they couldn't escape the crash ... All the passengers on the dock number one were wearing life vests. Still, the casualties are presumed to have been such a shock at the time of the collision that the fisherman in the cabin did not have time to escape. According to the Korea Coast Guard, 11 of the 13 dead were found on board. Passengers were kept indoors on the boat's departure due to cold weather. The large cracks in the stern on the pier seem to have caused quite a shock and knocked over the boat in an instant, the police said, noting that most of the bodies were unable to escape from the ship. It is also believed that the rapid current flow and low water temperatures have affected the deaths of two drifting passengers. "" Even though you are wearing a life jacket, it is hard for the swimmers to survive long hours, "" the Coast Guard said. The currents were strong in the affected areas and the speed of the water was especially strong on this day. "" The temperature in the waters at the time of the accident was 10.4 degrees, and the IAMSAR manual says, "" It was possible for 50 % of the swimmers to live up to two hours ago, but with a low risk of death, "" an official said.Whose son a systematic Early countermeasure, Moon Jae-in time out isn't president was an accident reports on for nearly an hour before and order up a point, Korean navy as well as rescue operations.Than the sinking of Sewol ferry and the time is it in a search and rescue operations were systematically assessed that to Early countermeasure.Moon Jae-in Yeongheungdo Incheon, Korea fishing boat accident in the national emergency management center in the morning of a report three days is president took off his glasses and read carefully. The presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae, however, is also raising controversy over the Coast Guard's slow response. The Korea Coast Guard said at 6:09 a.m. when the accident happened, fishing boat passengers and oil tanker captain reported the accident to 112. After the accident, the Coast Guard ordered the crew to leave at around 6:13. It took 13 minutes for the first rescue boat to leave. The rescue boat arrived on site around 6:42, 33 minutes after leaving at 6:26. Considering the fact that the Golden Time of the accident is one hour, it is a pity that the first arrival was early but the departure was delayed. Furthermore, the first high-speed boat arrived without the personnel and equipment to rescue it, and therefore, it was necessary for them to go to the rescue and search for the lighters. The special rescue team arrived at 7:17 a.m., more than an hour after the accident, due to the distance of the special rescue team carrying a search underwater and equipment. "" We are not prepared for a 24-hour sea accident like the ground police or fire, and when that happened, it took us time to get out of here with personnel and equipment, "" a Coast Guard official said. (First time in 33 minutes)Incheon and Sejong : Lee Don-seong, Ahn Yong-seong, and Lee Jeong-woo, a reporter of the media world, two years ago. A dolphin boat capsized and 15 people died in Jeju Island's waters. The accident in Incheon was also very damaging. Let's talk to Kim Nam-jun, a reporter from the Ministry of Social Affairs. [Question 1] First of all, reporter Kim, the accident report was received nine minutes after the departure. Where exactly was it? Yes, as you can see, there was an accident in the sea 1.8 kilometers from Jindu Port in Yeongheungdo, Incheon. In fact, the accident happened right after the sailing. As you can see, the accident happened when a fishing boat collided with an oil tanker on the opposite side of 336 tons and overturned when the stern collided. Incheon Coast Guard arrived in the accident area at 6:42 a.m. for the first time and is currently in the process of rescue efforts. [Question 2] The rescue team arrived in 33 minutes. What was the rescue situation then? Yes, there were four conditions that made rescue difficult. First, it is darkness. The accident took place at 6:09 a.m., one and a half hours before sunrise, so it was quite dark. Water temperature was also a problem. The water temperature was about seven to eight degrees, and the wind was strong, according to the Coast Guard. If the speed of wind is higher than 14m per second, a strong wind is blowing at the scene of the accident at 10 to 12m per second. Birds have also made rescue more difficult. Today's tidal currents are bigger than usual at 8.5 meters and are likely to drift toward the sea as the tide falls. [Question 3] 20 out of 22 rescue workers in adverse conditions. Thirteen people were still dead. Why are there so many victims? Of the four conditions I mentioned earlier, I think we need to pay attention to the water temperature first. At the time of the accident, the temperature was seven to eight degrees of cold water. Experts say it's hard to stay this hot for long. That's what experts say. [Kim Joo-hyun : Of course, if it takes more than 20 minutes, it could have died, although it is different for each person.] In particular, 14 people were trapped inside the hull, with the boat suddenly overturned. That's why they were more likely to drown than the person who drifted out of the boat. That's why 11 of the 14 people who actually rescued the ship died. [Question 4] Many people who saw today's accident reminded me of the tragedy of the Sewol. Q : Is the government's response improved compared to the time? Moon Jae-in in Korea Coast Guard's Day on October 13 last September also learned its lessons from the sinking of Sewol ferry disaster response system for president left end for gyaeseonhae. The president says. [Coast Guard Day event (September 13)] "" Please go over the issues identified during the rescue efforts in Sewol to determine the root cause and determine the overall effectiveness of the incident. "" The president is receiving the report for the first time, the Park received a written report for former president during the sinking of Sewol ferry disaster site, and about 16 minutes faster than at the time of response than at the time.Out for 10 minutes faster. But the good news is that there were many deaths. It is very important to report quickly and to direct. They need a fundamental measure to rescue the victims quickly and minimize them. Yes, there are still two missing persons. I hope the best rescue efforts are carried out by the end.

"" He pointed out that Kim`s ambition to develop nuclear weapons is the most serious security threat facing the United States. McMaster explained, The biggest and most urgent threat facing the United States and the rest of the world is Kim Jong-un's continuous efforts to develop the North Korean rogue regime and the ability to possess long-range nuclear weapons. Then, "" It is very important for all allies, partners, and all of us to stress internationally that the pursuit of such capabilities is a dead end to him and his regime. "" "" It takes time to assess each missile launch, but what is clear is that North Korea is improving every time it launches a missile or performs a nuclear test, "" explained McMaster. "" It is more important to understand that North Korea has learned from and improved from its failures over the past few years, and that they are stepping up their threats to all of us, "" he added. gogogo@yna.co.kr Kang Jong-gu, a reporter at Incheon International Federation News, said, "" Seven survivors of the Incheon fishing boat pier number 1 (9.77 tons) were rescued dramatically after many years of struggle. The accident occurred at 6:09 a.m. on a mile sea off Jindoung Island, Ongjing-gun, Incheon. When the first fishing boat, the vessel's main dock, collided with the tanker Myeongjin 15 (336 ton grade), 13 of the 22 crew members aboard died and two were missing. It was such an instant collision that most of the fishermen in the cabin had died without being able to escape from the overturned boat. Eleven out of 13 were found on board, and only two were killed while drifting in the sea. Fishing travelers aboard the same boat, but the difference between life and death was stark. Seo (37) and three others were rescued after falling into the sea after being out of the cabin and being hit. Seo, her brother (35) and her colleague Kim (27) were stuck in a cabin with a life jacket outside, but they fell into a collision and floated on the ground. They drifted around the scene for about 10-15 minutes and were rescued by an accident partner ship, the tanker crew. After the collision, Song was in the cabin by overturning a ship, but was rescued by a tanker crew after escaping by force through a broken window. Three others were rescued after more than an hour and a half in an ' air pocket ' on an overturned boat. Air pocket is where air is formed by not being flooded before a ship is completely sunk. Simmo and three others waited in an air pocket of the steering room inside the overturned pier and were rescued at 7:43 a.m. by the Coast Guard's Incheon rescue team. "" The deck 1 was fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) material, so it wasn't completely settled and some of it was floating on the surface, "" a Coast Guard official said at the Incheon rescue pockets that survived. The survivors were said to be in relatively good health. Now, Seo and Song are recovering from treatment at a street hospital. Song, who escaped from the water by himself, showed signs of pneumonia, but his condition was not serious, according to reports. All three people rescued from the air pocket were also released. Shim and two others were released from Shihwa Hospital, and his aunt (32) was discharged from Inha University Hospital.

Markle is married with a white father and an African-American mother. This is why the British royal family is credited with having "" an open era. "" In marriage, personal attractiveness and attraction are important, and the analysis that the identities, age, past, and races reflect social customs of the 21st century, which are not a barrier to marriage, is also persuasive. But compared to Scandinavia, the country is just the beginning. Already long ago, more attractive, open and heart-breaking royal romances began to take place. Consider the marriage revolution of the Scandinavian royal families such as Norway, Denmark and Sweden. Haral V, a Norwegian king, and Haral V were allowed to marry a non-royal or non-bank woman who told their father in 1968, "" If I am not a woman, I will be single for life. "" In a democratic society, royalty and aristocrats are no longer allowed to claim their own league. "" If it were not for this woman, I would be single all my life, "" says Norwegian king Haral V, in front of his father, Olmert, 1968, when he was Crown Prince. After nine years of clandestine relationships with my Tutor commoner Sonja Haraldsen, I will marry her. Until then, there was no such thing as a commoner prince in Norway. Royal marriages were also rare. Prince Haral made a multiple camp in front of his father. He was the only immediate successor to Olmert's direct line of descent. The father moved before his son's determined will. The government also supported the two marriages. Formal photographs of King Haral V of Norway and Queen Sonja of 1968. The ceremony married that year and established a new tradition in the royal family. The people welcomed the princess, not the royal family but the nobility. In the era of democracy, status was also proven meaningless to the royal family. Haral V was crowned in 91, and Sonja became Norway's first commoner queen. Princess Martha and Princess Louise of Norway. The Haral V couple had a daughter and a son. All were married to commoners.

The Prince of Wales took her son, Marius, from a former boyfriend to the wedding hall. This honesty is the driving force behind the royal family's support. This is when the weakness has been turned into an advantage. Prince Hokon (44) said, "" In August 2001, marriage caused the whole country to go wild. There were many difficulties. First, Mehte Marith Wheibi (44), who became the Crown Princess of Wales, was a single mother. Secondly, Morten Borg, the father of Prince Marian Borghebe, the former brother and father of Crown Princess Thievin, was a drug and drug investor. Third, the Crown Prince couple announced their engagement in December 2000, and disclosed that they had already lived together for a year.

"▽ New Sis&amp;Hong Hyo-The accident involving a nine-seven-ton fishing boat collided with a three-three ton oil tanker near Yeongheung Island at 6:12 a.m. on July 3, causing a fishing boat to tip over from the scene. 2017.12.03 (Photo provided by Coast Guard) An estimated number of fishing boats from the fishing boat photo@newsis.com were launched at 6 a.m. when 22 fishermen were killed in a collision and overturned by a collision ... 13 men and two others were lost in an accident The accident rescued 20 of the 22 people on the fishing boat, but killed 13 others. Two others are missing. The accident occurred at 6:09 a.m. Friday when a nine-seventh-ton fishing boat collided with a three-three-fourth-ton fishing boat (two fishermen) at Jinheungdong Island, southwest of Incheon, and crashed into 20 passengers. After the accident, 22 sailors on board the No. 1 dock were trapped inside the hull or drowned in the sea. Thirteen rescue workers were rescued by the Coast Guard when it entered the hull of the ship while seven others were rescued from drifting offshore. The first report was made by the National Police Agency (NPA) at 112 a.m., a victim of an accident. The Incheon Coast Guard then ordered the Youngheung Police Box, the patrol boat and the guard ship P12, to go to the scene four minutes later. The Coast Guard rescue boat left for the accident at 6:25 a.m. and arrived at the scene at 6:42 a.m. after the accident. The helicopter was called on to pick up the weather at 7:10 and arrived at the scene at 7:24 a.m., 14 minutes later. At the time, a tanker was being rescued when it crashed at the scene of the accident. Four people were rescued from the tanker and all of them are alive. Maritime police helped rescue 20 of the 22 fishermen on fishing boats, but two were missing. Among the rescued, 13 people were killed. Two others are missing. Although the exact cause of the accident has not yet been confirmed, it is believed to have occurred while passing through a narrow channel under the bridge. "" We have determined that the weather is northwest of the sea, with winds of 8-12 meters, waves are going down to 1-1.5 meters, visibility is down to a mile, cloudy and wet, "" a Coast Guard official said. Maritime police are currently operating eight aircraft, including 52 Coast Guard patrol ships, 16 navy vessels, nine private fishing boats, three Coast Guard helicopters, two Navy helicopters and three related organizations. sky0322@newsis.com> The 10 % safety investment ratio is critical, and the controversy over the free ride for the elderly or older who are over 65 years old is growing over the establishment of the Public Service Agency. Last year alone losses from free riding for senior citizens amounted to 544.3 billion won, according to the National Urban Railroad. As the aging process progresses, the loss is expected to snowball. If the situation continues, the government's argument could prove to be too difficult to control and ultimately threaten traffic safety. Meanwhile, many say that free rides for senior citizens should not be approached solely with market principles. The government should look at the whole nation as a welfare policy. They also claim that the effect of free ride by senior citizens is significant. Although the two sides are in a situation where their logic is strongly opposed, both sides agree that they should keep the people safe. It is time to find a way to continue the welfare of the people while keeping the safety of the people. Those who oppose free riding for the elderly say, "" As losses increase, the local governments ' budgets decrease, which threatens the safety of the city's railways. "" Seoul Metro's budget for safe investment plunged from 29.5 percent in 2009 to 7.7 percent in 2014. Fortunately, he recovered slightly to 13.8 percent last year, but his recovery was still low. If the subway operators spent on free transportation and other public services, they could have little time to invest in safety, said Lee Seung-woo, head of the NSP's task force. Those in favor of free riding argue that the elderly's welfare has far-reaching effects on the economy. They say free ride will increase leisure activities of the elderly, resulting in fewer self-induced or depressed seniors. According to a joint study by Yoo Jeong-hoon, a professor of transportation systems engineering at Aju University and the Korea Transport Research Institute, free ride at age 65 or older due to suicide, depression and reduced transportation accident costs amounted to 2,362 won. Given the rapidly growing number of elderly people, guaranteeing the right to move by using the free-rider system would have great social and economic benefits, such as reducing medical costs, suicide and depression, Yoo said. Civic groups, including experts, are offering various solutions amid growing controversy over free ride for the elderly. In 1981, when free ride for the elderly was enforced, only 4 percent of the population was over the age of 65, but now 14 percent of the population says they need to raise their age standard. Some say that the government should take responsibility and provide financial support for the free ride since it is a system created by the central government. Some say that free rides for the elderly should be adjusted outside of commuting hours. Despite the controversy, it`s a serious problem that the people`s safety is threatened due to a lack of funds, said Insejin University Fire & Marine Insurance professor, whose duty is to actively protect people`s lives and property issues. / journalist Park Woo-in wipark@sedaily.com [Go straight to the Seoul Economy] DB, the top Korean scientist since 1997!

"" Considering the growing presence of AR-based applications at Apple's App Store, smartphone makers are likely to hire a large number of AR related components next year.Orders for true-depth cameras for OLEDs as well as face IDs were also expected to increase, said Olsen, who says Apple will replace the true-depth camera with the iPhone on the front next year.Apple recently requested an iPhone X manufacturer of true-depth 3D sensor modules for true-depth cameras to triple its output.More than 15 million units of iPhone X. have been sold in the United States since its launch on Friday, said Jun Zhang, an analyst at the Rosenblant Securities Co.

About 60 percent of Samsung Electronics ’ operating profit came from its parts business in the third quarter, "" a securities industry insider said. "" Although Samsung Electronics is clearly leading the market with its overwhelming illusion of technology, its fifth generation (although) is clearly driving the market.Prior to JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley also lowered its investment opinion in Samsung from the company to neutral on July 26, and changed its target price from 2.9 million won to 2.8 million won.Sean Kim, economist at Morgan Stanley, pointed out that NAND flash prices have already fallen in the first quarter of 2016 and DRAM prices are likely to remain strong until the first quarter of next year.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs, another foreign-invested bank, maintained its opinion and target share price on Samsung.

The Wall Street Journal quoted a study by a research firm called Counterpoint Point on July 2 (local time).The local price of an OLED`s iPhone X, developed by Samsung Display, is $ 999. This means that about 10 percent of sales per iPhone will go to Samsung. Samsung is supplying OLEDs, the key component of the iPhone X, as well as mobile DRAM and various sensors.The counter point assumes Apple will sell 130 million units of iPhone, and Samsung Electronics could earn as much as $ 14 billion (approximately 16 trillion won) in profit over the next two years. Samsung has more than $ 10 billion in profit to make from the Galaxy S8 during the same period.An official in the electronics industry said, "" There is still enough controversy over the semiconductor business forecast, "" adding, "" The more the iPhone X sells, the more Samsung Electronics can benefit from, and small to mid-sized OLEDs such as China.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un recently launched a continent-type ballistic missile called the "" nuclear tire train "" that was launched by North Korean leader Kim Hyo-jung. North Korea`s state-run Korean Central News Agency reported on July 3 that Kim Jong Un led an Amnok River tire factory in Seoul that shone with the tasks of producing tires, which the party places great emphasis on rehabilitation. The head of the Korean delegation, Kim Jong-un, said he saw tires from a variety of factories and large tires from a new ballistic rocket launch vehicle. The top leadership also said it was a task to unconditionally develop tires for the nation`s nine-axis tire factory in September when it actively led preparations for the November accident. The November war, as referred to by the Korean Central News Agency, is believed to have been North Korea`s launch of a Massic-class, 15-type missile on July 29. North Korea then announced it had developed and completed a new 9-axis drive-shot truck, and released a photo of a new mobile launch vehicle with an axle that would have grown from the existing 8-axis Earth-14 ' plant to the 15-axle nuclear plant.The maker`s major parts, such as the mass-in-the-wheel mass-underwater tires and the nine-wheelers of the Mars-shaped North Korean nuclear plant, are much more impressive than those of its ultra-feet nuclear plant, which was launched on July 29. He went on to say, "" The decision of the party is science and victory has been strongly confirmed. When it comes to the exercise of self-regenerating revolution, there is no way to say that it was difficult to capture the world again.

Hong, who graduated from both middle and high schools in Canada and the United States during his elementary school years in 2008, scored a perfect score of 2,400 points on the U.S. college entrance exam, or SAT, and entered Harvard University in 2015. Studying on a full scholarship, he returned to the Marine Corps in August to fulfill his mandatory military duty. He was fluent in English and could have applied for a language course or had a substitute job at a company for a certain time after graduating from college, but chose to become a Marine. His parents also tried to dissuade Hong from joining the Marine Corps because it required him to train hard. Hong's involvement in the Marine Corps was largely due to the surprise bombing of Yeonpyeong Island in November 2010 when North Korean troops fired shells at Yeonpyeong Island, the Marine Corps. Hong Byung-eun, who was studying in Canada at the time, saw a Marine soldier firing on a K-9 self-propelled gun set on fire by North Korea's armed forces and decided to defend his country like them. Before entering the military, he prepared thoroughly to exercise his stamina and lose weight by running and doing push-ups for months, and passed the Marine Corps selection test once. Hong, with his red Marine badge on his chest, began his second challenge with the Marine Corps following his first challenge to his dream at Harvard, saying, I think the Marine Corps is worth more than I am. `` I will be a Marine who does my best to protect the nation, as a hero of the Yeonpyeong attack, '' he said.

"" Skepticism over the government's provision of a new provision to reduce the low fertility rate is growing. Children's allowance introduced in July next year will be 100,000 won per month for all children aged 0-5 regardless of income level. In fact, the government's much-awaited cash-supported policy for women is unrealistic.According to the ministry on March 3, the nation has been paying child support starting in March 2013 and has spent more than 100 trillion won on the issue over the past 10 years. However, Korea`s fertility rate, or the combined fertility rate of 1.17, remains the lowest in the world.■ Children's allowance and high income bracket are estimated to benefit about 2.5 million people when the subsidy is introduced in July next year because they are more advantaged than the lower income bracket, but the benefit for higher income bracket is more prevalent among the lower income bracket.According to the results of an analysis of the amount of money collected by Rep. The third tier, which is in the middle class, will receive 3.3 trillion won (24.7 percent), and the fifth percentile, which is in the upper-income bracket, 2.8 trillion (20.9 percent).On the other hand, the second tier, which is in the lower middle class, is expected to receive 1.5 trillion won (11.1 percent), and the first tier, which is in the lower middle class, is expected to receive only 1.1 trillion (8.8 percent). The upper fifth percentile receives 2.4 times more than the lower tenth percentile. It is an imbalance because the higher one's income, the more babies one has.■ As of late last year, 31 out of 35 members of OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) have adopted child benefits. The U.K. and Germany paid the entire class an equal amount regardless of income levels, and five countries including Japan and France supported the entire group but were different in price. Eleven countries, including Italy and the Netherlands, excluded high-income bracket workers.However, it is not clear that the birth rate will go up on the basis of the allowance. On the other hand, the combination of various childcare support with the number of children per income tier resulted in an increase in the birth rate. France is the representative country. France introduced child benefits in 1932 but did not stop the falling birth rates until the 1990s. However, the birth rate began to rise when couples who lived together through a radical policy called the Civil Solidarity Convention admitted it as a family form legally like married couples. It provides tax and medical insurance benefits, does not have to follow the surname of the spouse, and eliminates the need for a legal procedure for termination of a contract when the couple is married.As a result, France maintains the highest fertility rate in Europe (2.01 children). In addition, businesses are supporting the lives of their employees by establishing in-house nursery or working remotely, and providing discounts on transportation and tax reduction until the age of 20.■ Child leave. Ars Praxia, a big data analyst firm, posted an analysis of 627,000 articles posted last year on three fertility and childcare communities, "" Momsholic Baby "" and "" 82 Cook. ""Looking through 40,2556 keywords among the postings with more than six comments or recommendations, the number of articles about husbands accounted for half, or 47 percent, with 10,995 articles. Most of the postings said husbands work late and do not contribute to childcare, such as company dinners or travel.They also said that cash support such as children's allowance and baby shower was negative and that more time is needed for fathers to take paternity leave and leave. One Internet user, who said, "" I appreciate the allowance, but I need more time for mothers to spend with my children, "" adding, "" I can't stop thinking about the dark side of the company. "" A year of paternity leave is too short. I wish basic two years were guaranteed, but I hope it will increase to at least 18 months, said the government official, Listen to the mothers ` voices and come up with practical measures to deal with low birth rates.The posting had more than 2,400 hits, and even related replies were asked to "" I want my mom and dad to take a two-year childcare leave every day. "" Employeer`s office would like me to provide childcare leave.Experts also point out that it is more urgent to improve the childcare environment, such as nurturing the working class of the child services and expanding the number of public childcare centers, than cash payments.IT and financial management at Soonchunhyang University Kim Yong-ha said, We are currently providing childcare services to the Department of Foreign Affairs, but with an estimated 30 trillion won per year in jobs for children if the budget and the workforce are vastly insufficient. Military authorities said Thursday that the U.S. Air Force, which will participate in its combined air training exercise "" non-gelant ace, "" arrived Thursday on its first combat flight in Gwangju. The U.S. Air Force has also completed deployment of six stealth fighter jets, six Electro-Electronics EA-18G Growler jets, 10 F-15C fighters and 10 F-16s. The aircraft will prepare for the training with a briefing one day before the training, and then begin the training on July 4. U.S. Air Force stealth fighter F-35B and early warning aircraft E-3 will reportedly return to the base after being deployed over Korea at U.S. Air Force bases in Japan during the training. The five-day drill, which runs through May 8, will employ 230 aircraft, including those from the U.S. Air Force stationed in Korea and those from the Korean Air Force.During training exercises, which arrived in South Korea last October, the F-35A fighter jets block infiltration by enemy aircraft and precisely target North Korea's nuclear, missile and missile launches with a core threat, including a TEL. They also practice to hit North Korean military long-range artillery that threatens the Seoul metropolitan area and block special forces from invading the sea. U.S. Air Force long-range strategic bomber B-1b Lancer will also be deployed over the Korean Peninsula during its training, conducting bombing exercises under cover by U.S. and U.S. air fighters. This drill is five days after North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICP-15) attack last month, and is expected to show off its threat to the U.S. nuclear and missile defense community. In particular, the unprecedented presence of stealth fighters on a scale could pose a significant threat to the vulnerable North. North Korea strongly protested the exercise in a statement by a Foreign Ministry spokesman on July 2, saying, Now, Trump is barging for nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula, with dangerous nuclear weapons. ljglory@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"Jinjeop Geumto-dong Seongnam Guri Galmae ""against acceptance"" 90 per cent of land ""10 million won per 3.3 square meters around the ground, we received less than one million won"" backlash is conflict between residents and services in two tracks for sale.Secret … gossip from a few years ago, price hikes years delayed due to conflicts and land ' Jinjeop Earth 2. ■ reportage the scene of three local green belt release possible recurrence will "" home mbCommittee against acceptance of temporary office wall hanging on the one million families housing projects of the Moon Jae-in, banners opposing camp to repay government announced a 'road map for Housing Welfare'.It is the fourth time in newly developed housing zones of the capital from being sharp warning, conflict over land compensation. A massive lifting of the green belt to supply 620,000 homes was planned, but residents who have been restricted from property rights for several years were urged to withdraw their designation. Though land nearby is likely to be "" tight "" with massive reimbursements, practical investment is not likely to be easy with development information leaking out of the area.In Namyangju, Gyeonggi Province, the area around the two districts, where the economy visited on July 1, quite a few clashes were brewing. This is the most spacious residential area (1,292,000 ㎡) and abundant supply area of housing in the Seoul Metropolitan area (12,612 homes). Most of the land in the public housing market is located in vinyl, and a local government employees took off the anti-landing placards displayed by residents during their stay in Seoul.Kim Chan-eung, 64, who spends more than 20 years digging chicken dung and farms GB land and then spends the rest of his life living in a plastic house. Shin Jin-seong, 76, who lives in a house with remodeled plastic houses, said, If I lived in Sanggye-dong, Seoul, I would have been accepted to farming here, and if I had never settled down to farm there for 30 years, it was accepted as a bargain. In Zone II, where the government pledged to build new public housing, only a few warehouses are visible, and more than 90 percent of them are vinyl greenhouse homes. Banners opposing the expropriation of steel around Geumto-dong, Sujeong-gu, Gyeonggi Province, where the third Pangyo Techno Valley is to be built. Although residents insist on "" deacception "" the price, the conflict is at the center of "" compensation. "" The land value of land bound on the greenbelt is estimated to be 500,000 won per 3.3 ㎡. As a railway bridge was built as an extension to subway Line 4, residents were already required to pay 600,000 to 700,000 won per 3.3 ㎡Nam Byung-mok, vice chairman of the Presidential Committee on Prevention and Communication of Groundhog in Seoul, said, As 86.5 percent of the land in the project area was raised to an agricultural and development restriction zone, farmers have been allowed to do business for tens of years. Most residents want to compensate the land around them by distributing land after development, but land after development is several times more expensive than land before development, so the government prefers to pay cash.The construction of the railway station, which is scheduled to provide 720,000 households with a green belt of 799,000 ㎡, is also facing a serious situation. In a vote that ended last month's public protest against the development, 470 votes cast, far more people voted in favor of the project than 68. Around Galmae Station, many of the warehouse owners have voluntarily built for them. H real estate representative at Galmae station said, "" Warehouse in the Galmae district has raised monthly rent of around 30,000 won, so it would cost us an enormous amount of money to pay, and if we were forced to do so, we would have to make substantial investment pressure. ""According to nearby real estate prices, the current market price of farmland in Galmae Subway Project District is between 4 million and 5 million won per 3.3 ㎡, 6 to 7 million won per residential area (Type 1), and 10 million won per road side. However, the official land price of farmland here is about one million won per 3.3 ㎡, a far cry from the real price. In the past this nest of the planet too, originally designated in the Lee Myung-bak administration had many years, forcing the supply of housing, conflict with land owners. Compensation and occupancy were delayed for many years in the Knowledge Information Town in Gwacheon, the areas designated as Godeok, Gangdong-gu, and Gangil 3-4 as landowners requested the withdrawal of the designation. Although it is efficient for the government to remove GB to provide cheap housing, it is hard for it to push for the sacrifice of the rights of residents, said Kim Seung-bae, head of the development team.Land prices are expected to rise further as more and more rewards are expected around the Seoul Metropolitan area ahead of next year's local elections. Geumto-dong, Seongnam City, has emerged as a hot potato, with the creation of the third Pangyo Techno Valley in Gyeonggi Province and the supply of apartments tailored for the residential welfare roadmap. More than ten more investors visited the government-authorized center near the project site, which is currently open on weekdays. Local real estate officials said, "" As rumors about the development of Geumto-dong spread from two to three years ago, land prices have already soared and it is not even possible to find an apartment sale recently. "" "" The land where a building can be built has become so dried up that the price exceeds 12 to 15 million won per 3.3 ㎡, "" said Kim Yang-hee, head of the Resident-dong Residental Housing Corporation. It is too late to find a new investment destination around the government's newly announced land. "" The maximum price that the market is currently acceptable for a public rental housing site in a development-restricted zone, "" a representative of an authorized brokerage said. "" It is difficult to find additional revenue in the market or the land that is available for investment. ""The two countries are also expected to have a sharp dispute over acceptance. In Geumto-dong, many areas are posted with placards saying, ' I can't live, save Geumto-dong. ' Seongnam City should protect the livelihood and property rights of its residents. Unlike the current 10,000 won that the market value in the region has exceeded, the amount of land compensation for Geumto-dong, which will be awarded by LH, is expected to fall far short of that.[Foreign Ministry of South Korea / South Chungcheong Province / Choongnam-Chooo Donghoon] Pictures released by North Korea's media The Yonhap news agency has been criticizing North Korea for conducting an extraordinary large-scale air-to-air drill between the two countries since July 4. Inside, it is like holding a rally, shooting a salute, and celebrating the completion of the nation's nuclear weapons program. The North Korean Workers ' Party's Journal of Government said in an editorial on Tuesday, "" The unprecedented explosion of invasion by warplanes of war, "" that hundreds of stealth fighters and other South Korean and South Korean fighter jets (F-35A and F-35B) will go on board this year. We have also used three of our own aircraft carriers to train at sea in the United States and re-designated North Korea as a sponsor of terrorism, prompting a series of recent U.S. pressure measures to provoke North Korea into an air force. In addition, the newspaper argues, "" The war of aggression by the U.S. and its agents is a clear demonstration that we have been armed with every possible means of strengthening our self-defense deterrence, and that it is a clear demonstration of our own self-destruction and of our own folly. "" The day before yesterday, North Korea`s Foreign Ministry issued a statement condemning the exercise. "" Now the Trumpes are begging for nuclear war, leaving a dangerous nuclear launch on the Korean Peninsula. "" "" The mission of the national nuclear forces is to fight off an invasion and an assault on the Republic of America. "" The R.O.K. Air Force will hold a non-Jailant ace training exercise that involves 230 U.S. and U.S. planes, including the F-22 Raptors, from April 4 to 8. It is the first time that an F-22s, the largest and most advanced fighter jet ever, will arrive on the Korean Peninsula. Among them, the North Korean regime is using the launch of the Mars-15-type nuclear weapon and the announcement of its completion of nuclear weapons to strengthen internal cohesion. The North`s state-run Korean Central News Agency announced yesterday that it hosted a reception in Pyongyang to celebrate the completion of its nuclear weapons program, historic missions, and victory over North Korea's rocket-powered country. After the event, fireworks were seen celebrating the success of the Samsung-15 film launch on the Daedong River, according to news reports. Government media outlets have been running related articles since July 29, the date of their release. Meanwhile, North Korean Central News Agency reported on July 3 that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who is believed to have produced the Time-Display Vehicle (TEL) of the Hwasong-15, visited the tire factory of the Amnok River in the North's capital. On the scene, Kim Jung-un proved in practice that when (factory workers) carried out a revolutionary spirit of self-reform, there were no fortifications to conquer and no one could penetrate. Kwon Kyung-sung, a reporter at the state-run Korean Central News Agency, reported that North Korean Workers ` Party Chairman Kim Jong-un recently conducted a on-site inspection of an Amnok River tire factory in Jagang-do.

"[Hankyoreh] starts on the 4th ... The petition against Cho Doo-soon being released from the office will be 600,000 cases that Cheong Wa Dae "" I will answer that, "" or "" I will drink alcohol and drive, "" but The presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae should give an official response to the sentence of "" alcohol reduction, "" or "" alcohol reduction, "" in which punishment is reduced in case of drunk crime. The number of participants in the petition against the draft bill reached about 211,000 as of July 3, exceeding the 200-thousand mark set by the presidential office. The petition was filed on July 4. `` It is nonsense to see people committing the same crimes when they commit the same crime on the strength of alcohol, '' Cheonggi said. `` Such a loophole should be eliminated. '' He says, "" Because of a reduction in drinking, the number of sentences for those who have commuted the sentence has been reduced from 15 years to 12 years. "" And it is hard to say that the grounds of the incriminating nation's current behavior, such as incriminatinating drinking, are not being verified. In fact, there is no provision on the reduction of alcohol intake or the reduction of alcohol consumption in criminal law. Article 10 (Body, mind and body) Article 2 (Act on the merits of a person who has a mental or physical disability on the ground shall be regarded as an act of reducing his elder brother.) The ability of the preceding paragraph refers to the ability to distinguish things or the ability to make decisions. Article 10 deals with mental and physical disabilities, which is considered to have been commuted from the state of weakness in the mind and body in the ability to discriminate against objects or make decisions on drunk crime. As a result, Cheong Wa Dae is paying keen attention to what it will say about the reduction of drinking. When the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae issued a petition in August, more than 200,000 people participated in it over a month, and a senior presidential secretary or minister responded officially to it. So far, the head of the Presidential Civil Service in the Republic of Korea responded to the petition for the abolition of the boy law and the petition for the abolition of abortion. Meanwhile, the ' Best Supporting Application ' of the National petition board is a petition with nearly 600,000 participants against Cho Doo-soon's release from prison.

According to the industry on July 3, Samsung Electronics will introduce its Galaxy S 9, a strategic smartphone, in the first half of next year. While some overseas IT media speculated that Samsung Electronics might have rolled out its Galaxy S 9 in a rare case against Apple's iPhone X-the World Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January, prior to its initial release date, was possible. Accordingly, the timing of the release is most likely to be either Mobile World Congress (MWC) or its own event in February in Barcelona, Spain. Samsung Electronics unveiled its Galaxy S5 to S7 at MWC, while the Galaxy S8 opened its doors at its events in New York and London, the United Kingdom, in March this year.Galaxy S 9 expected images, Twitter captured overseas IT media created by IT Tweeterian Benjamin Gaskin, are all about to upgrade their Galaxy S 9 design to something similar to the original Galaxy S8 Galaxy S9 is expected to adopt the Infiniti display, which minimizes bezels (borders), as it does Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8. Some say the bezel will be thinner than the previous one, allowing displays to account for as much as 90 percent of the display. In the first half of this year, the Galaxy S8, a strategic smartphone, had a total of 84 percent display. It is also expected that the Galaxy Note 8 will have a dual camera with an anti-handle (OIS) feature. In addition, Qualcomm's latest chip, Snapshot, and user experience are expected to improve. The Galaxy S8 image and fingerprint recognition sensors have different predictions. Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8 are equipped with a fingerprint recognition sensor next to the rear camera, provoking discontent among consumers. As Apple introduced a face ID, which replaces the existing touch ID (fingerprint recognition) on its iPhone X, Samsung Electronics is also likely to differentiate from the previous one by incorporating a fingerprint sensor on its front displays. IT media including Let's Go Digital reported that Samsung filed a patent against a fingerprint sensor built into the display at the World Intellectual Property Organization. There is a fingerprint sensor between the cover glass and the touch sensor, a pressure sensor is placed at the bottom of the display panel and presses the display to operate the sensor as a pressure-driven corrosion protection device. However, due to technical reasons, it is expected that the front display all-in-one fingerprint recognition sensor will be installed in Galaxy Note 9, one beat later than the Galaxy S9.

"▽ Construction delay…Halleypad's final process remains (Daegu = Yonhap News Agency) : It is expected that the Gyeongbuk Hospital Regional trauma center will start operating in the first half of next year, five years after it was selected to support the Health and Welfare Ministry.Kyungbook National University Hospital announced on July 3 that it will operate a regional trauma center in the first half of next year as it plans to construct 90 percent of its helipad on the rooftop. It is because the halipad process required to transport injured patients by helicopter in remote areas such as mountainous areas or islands is delayed. The Regional trauma center is a specialized care facility with a patient transfer system that delivers patients with severe trauma directly to the trauma center and a team of trauma specialists. Kyungpook National University Hospital was selected as the Support Agency for Regional trauma center of the Ministry of Health and Welfare in November 2012 and received 1 billion won in annual labor costs including 8 billion won in installation of facilities and equipment. Other infrastructure has been in place, such as operating room, intensive care unit, and hospital room, but Helipad has been holding on to it and has not yet been completed until 2015 when the office was established. People who were concerned about noise damage were opposed to the installation of Helipad, and due to the private main building, the Cultural Heritage Administration had to approve the change in the national cultural properties. Recently, due to construction company, Helipad construction was late. However, the Kyungpook National University Hospital continued to treat serious trauma patients, except those who need helicopter transfer, in the form of general trauma centers. The department is providing eight doctors in surgery, breast and nurse positions and taking care of patients with severe trauma. An official at Kyungpook National University Hospital said, "" If the helipad process is completed as planned, I have completed other procedures including approval of use and can seriously reduce my chances of running the local trauma center.

"Smokers ' Fines 100,000 Won … Even employers still frequently complain about smoking blind spots, such as karaoke rooms, karaoke bars, and clubs ... No smoking tickets, smoking is needed … "" ▽ Non-literable theory : From now on, 30,000 indoor sports facilities including pool halls and screen golf courses will be banned from smoking. According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare on July 3, the revised law on public health last year designated pool halls and screen golf courses as non-smoking areas. Existing non-smoking facilities have only imposed restrictions on large-scale facilities that "" accommodate more than 1,000 people, "" but future regulations will apply to all indoor sports facilities of all sizes. The total number of indoor sports facilities registered in accordance with the Act on the Installation and Use of Sports Facilities was 55.9 % with 2,192 pool halls and 9222 golf ranges. Along with the facilities, the owners of sports stamps and fitness centers across the nation will be required to install signs to show non-smoking areas. If you smoke in non-smoking areas, you will be fined 100,000 won. It is equivalent to the fines for no smoking areas in other indoor facilities. Owners of non-smoking areas should also have to attach signs and stickers at major locations, such as building entrances, stairs, or restrooms, and if they fail to comply with the order, a fine will be imposed. The fine is 1.7 million won, 3.3 million won, and 5 million won in net addition to the fine. The ministry will have no smoking officials at local governments or health centers at the scene of this month to crack down on them. However, he plans to run a three-month leave of absence until March 2 next year, after which he will impose a real fine. Even if the smoking ban is extended to North Korea, the smoking ban must be stopped at the request of a smoking coach. We ask for active participation in anti-smoking activities from within sports facilities, so that men, women and children can enjoy a pleasant environment without tobacco smoke, a ministry official said. As a result of the revision, businesses designated as non-smoking areas regardless of size have increased to ▲ PC lounge, entertainment room, and other game facilities. In addition, under the current law, buildings with a gross floor area of 1000 ㎡ or more will be designated as non-smoking buildings. All the businesses operating inside the building are non-smoking areas. Public facilities, such as schools, children's houses, and public facilities, tourist accommodations, a performance area (300 people or more), transportation means (16 people or more), and bus stops and roads in front of the tunnel are also non-smoking. However, there is still a blind spot. ▲ Garak karaoke, singing room, and origin are not regulated except for karaoke, retail and emerging bars, nightclubs ▲ sports facilities that are not required to register and report to. School facilities have also been freed from the law and exposed to second-hand smoke. That is because each local government operates according to its own regulations, not the Health Promotion Act. In the case of elementary, middle, and high schools, a considerable number of municipal and provincial governments have designated non-smoking areas with a range of 10-50 meters. But the kindergarten and kindergarten were the stage books. In addition, the effectiveness of the crackdown on non-smoking areas is also being debated. Local governments ' anti-smoking leaders are on the scene, with smokers more often in conflict with each other. Officials at the scene say it is difficult to exercise governmental power, such as the police, despite having the authority to crack down on them. On the other hand, the smokers ' complaints are beyond description. Smoking areas were getting wider and wider, while smoking areas were not attractive, with smokers complaining, "" We sell cigarettes and don't give them room to smoke. "" As non-smoking areas are expanding, many people are asking for more and more consideration for smoking areas and measures to prevent smoking. Tax revenues from cigarettes are on the rise. The number of cigarettes taxes per cigarette has jumped from 3.1 trillion won in 2014 before cigarette prices rose to 10.3 trillion won in 2015, with sales forecast to remain flat at a modest level last year. In addition to the tax on cigarettes, the amount of cigarette taxes (Health Promotion Fund) is expected to grow from 1.6284 trillion won in 2014 to 2.4757 trillion won in 2015 and to 2.963 trillion won in 2016. However, only 5 percent of the money is directly spent on the use of double-smoking smokers, which is the national smoking support budget. Even so, the government is discussing setting the budget at the level of 146.7 billion won this year, in the face of public opposition, as it tries to reduce the price by 10 percent next year. ijoinon@newsis.com> Since news of [anchor] accident was reported, the government has been in a tense position.

"20 years of establishment of the Domestic Violence Prevention Law … the number of divorce applications for disclosesnave has remained at 4,400. "" Even during the pre-surveillance process of treating assaulters, no one has been identified as being identified by the legal authorities. Until his divorce was "" successful, "" he was plagued by ruthless threats and assaults.After being married and suffering years of violent behavior, Kim managed to obtain consent from her husband and asked for a divorce. But he threatened to sell you to a human trafficking ring as soon as you get divorced and left the court when he was in attendance to confirm your intention to divorce. After that, her husband visited her often and threatened her with a deadly weapon. On the day of the divorce, Kim was brutally beaten by her husband. Many women who have decided to divorce due to domestic violence are exposed to their husbands ' retaliation for demanding divorce. It is also pointed out that the murder of a wife with a deadly weapon by her husband on July 25 was not an exception. Though it is not impossible to separate the perpetrators from the victims, many say that effective measures are needed due to loopholes. According to the Supreme Court on July 3, the average number of divorces in the past five years was 4,427, citing spouse ' psychological and physical abuse, and the number of differences (4,856 cases) in the past year.However, experts say the figure is only the tip of the iceberg. Most domestic violence victims have their children or their families hostage and find it difficult to decide to divorce. That is, statistics show that people asked for a divorce because they could not endure domestic violence. In fact, the victim of domestic violence, A, said, I decided to divorce because if I lived like this, I would kill my husband.There is a way to separate domestic violence victims from offenders. The law enables emergency measures to separate the perpetrators and victims from the scene, and emergency measures that can be exercised ex post facto by police officers, and temporary actions requested by the prosecution. There is a victims ' protection order that enables the victim to directly ask the court to ban access. However, critics say that the loopholes of each system are evident, causing many to criticize the system's effectiveness. There is no way to separate emergency measures if the victim disagrees with the extradition of the shelter and the temporary measures take at least seven days to reach a court decision, forcing them to be exposed to an offender's retaliation for a certain period. Last year, 1,466 victims ' protection orders were received, but less than half of them were actually protected by rejection or withdrawal. Experts say that there is no system or policy to protect victims from threats, especially during divorce. Lee Hyun-gon, lawyer of the court, said, "" Even the domestic litigation law provides pre-disposal measures to ban people from accessing their homes, but the court can not afford to expose their victims while waiting for the court's decision, and they can not afford to give evidence of previous violent acts by offenders. "" Lack of understanding from related agencies is another problem. Domestic violence victim B (60, female), during a divorce last year, told the court's family inspector that "" I've lived by my word of mouth, but I've been threatened with death. "" Recently, a revision of the Family Violence Prevention and Victims ' Protection Act, which states the guarantee of half-pollution rights for domestic violence, passed the National Assembly's plenary session, but failed to pass the revision, and was consulted as to protect the safety of the divorced victims. Even though it has been nearly 20 years since the law was enacted, the possibility of domestic violence was not considered in divorce proceedings, said the director general of the telephone shelter for Korean women in her study. We need to take practical measures to account for the fact that the victims who decided to divorce suffer intense threats and violence from their perpetrators, the official said.Samsung Electronics is again entering the premium mobile phone "" Galaxy S8""market with its red card.Samsung Electronics unveiled its new Galaxy S8 "" Burgandi Red "" color in Korea on July 28.The Galaxy S8`s series will feature six colors, including mini black, Orkid Gray, Arctic Silver, Coral Blue and Rose Pink, and Burgandi Red.

"One Million Signing-off Movement Against Catholicism : "" Abolition Is Recommited "" ; "" Penalties of Abortion to Stop 10 Construction-Related Adologies ; in fact, civil suits against men ; All Abortion to abolish abortion ; and abortion ; and crime ; and to abolish abortion ; in Gwanghwamun on the 2nd [News 1] “eliminate the illegal abortion!” “The criminal is, if abortion is wrong country!”, The Korea Women Link already held, Sejongno Park at Gwanghwamoon, Seoul, Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center, and so on.(Organizers estimated) ‘abolition of illegal abortion for both coalition’ organized by the 11 women's groups in more than 500 people took part. Participants wore black cloaks around their faces and marched to the front of Cheong Wa Dae, shouting slogans to demand the abolition of abortion. One activist at the sexual harassment clinic said, "" To designate the termination of abortions for all women as illegal, and to allow abortion only in exceptional cases, such as sexual violence, is to erase the nation and society's right to make a decision on women's self-conception to control their population. "" The Korean version of the protest was called "" The Black Showdown. "" Last year, women staged a strike in black as the council pushed for a total abortion ban in Poland. At that time, the Polish parliament withdrawn the relevant legislation, focusing on social networking services (SNS), amid criticism that it was "" an infringement of women's reproductive rights and the right to self-determination "". The controversy flared up for the second time since Henry 2010 when the presidential office announced that it would launch a fact-finding mission to review the abolition of abortion laws next year. The controversy began on July 26 when the presidential chief of civil affairs at the presidential office of the nation said, The current punishment for abortion is not the responsibility of the state or the men. In the process, the Catholic Church joined in the debate as Cho falsely delivered Pope Francis ' "" new balance "" speech. Although Cho apologized in person to Lee Yong-hoon, head of the Catholic Principal`s Bioethics Committee, the Catholic Church organized an emergency committee to eliminate abortion crimes and began a signature-seeking campaign. The Catholic Church said, Human life has priority over women's right to self-determination and health. We should not abolish abortion laws and instead strengthen the responsibility of men. It is the second time that an abortion debate has broken out in Korea since 2010. In those days, a group of obstetricians ' groups called Proso Life was sparked by accusing colleagues of performing abortion procedures. The Constitutional Court ruled narrowly on the abolition of abortion laws with a constitutional appeal of 4 to 4 in 2012. Ahead of the court's second ruling next year, the lower court is divided over whether to punish those who committed abortion. Some ruling party members say that the bill should be put into the process of public discussion. The court's decision on the issue is based on the questions and answers of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court. Q : The requirements of abortion laws are : "" the act of expelling a fetus out of the mother before the time of natural childbirth or of an artificial death in the mother. According to the Supreme Court's judgment in 2005, even if the fetus outside the mother is not dead, abortion is committed. Korea has in principle prohibited the abortion on criminal laws (Article 270, Article 1). However, in the case that the maternal health law endangers the life of pregnant women, in the case of rape or quasI-radiation cases, it was allowed within 24 weeks. "" Q : State of the Health and actual punishment cases were found to be in the survey by the Health Ministry of 2010. "" However, only about 10 cases are prosecuted each year, and the courts are threatening to delay the sentence or give fines. There were no cases of imprisonment even after the Constitutional Court's decision in 2012 to uphold the constitution. In 2015, the court lowered the penalty to 2 million won for a woman who was pregnant with an affair but aborted her sentence in June and her two-year stay of execution. Then, ' Worldwide, the trend is toward greater freedom of abortion and there are still pros and cons on whether to punish abortion crimes. Passing jail time is not profitable except to satisfy the husband's desire for revenge, ' explained Lee.A : In its 2012 decision, the court said, "" The fertilized egg has been granted the right to live from the time it was implanted into the womb. "" Afterwards, the view is that babies implanted in the womb can not be distinguished based on biological differentiation. It usually takes 14 days for fertilized eggs to be implanted into the womb. On the other hand, the four judges who argued against this said, ' A fetus prior to 24 weeks is not properly formed as an alveolI, so it is unlikely that it will survive the elimination of the uterus would allow it to have any ability to function independently, especially during weeks 1 to 12 ' The women's group says, ' The very view of the abortion issue as an unborn child is the sole blame for abortion '. On the other hand, Catholic and other religious groups insist that women's right to self-determination should not take precedence over the right to live. "" Q : The harm from illegal abortion operations has been. A : "" Incidents of death have occurred steadily. In November 2012, a female high school student died during an abortion. The Seoul Western District Court ruled in August this year that the bereaved family of a woman in her 30s who died of an overdose during an abortion procedure paid about 135 million won to her. The court said, "" Currently, the medications used for abortion at obstetricians are licensed only as digestive ulcer solvents such as gastric and duodenal ulcers, so it would lead to complications for men when used in the current application. ""A : The penal code is to be punished only by the "" women "" and by the medical doctor and doctor who performed the abortion operation, so men are excluded. There are cases in which some women have won by civil litigation. The Seoul Northern District Court ruled in July that the married man, who was forced to conceive and aborted a married woman, pay 15 million won in damages to her while socializing with the unmarried woman. Mr. D's deception of a marriage and continued intercourse was considered. "" Lee Yoo-jung, reporter uuu Joongang.co.krt, and Facebook [Central Sunday] [SS @3]"
