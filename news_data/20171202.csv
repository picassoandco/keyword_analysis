"Samsung Electronics unveiled its high-end folder phones, which are specialized in the Chinese market. According to foreign news agencies, Samsung Electronics unveiled ' W 2018, ' which is equipped with China Telecom, two touch screens and Samsung's artificial intelligent voice secretary, ' Bigsby, ' at Xiamen, Fujian Province on July 1 (local time). The event was held to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Samsung's W Series and its 25th anniversary in China.The phone is in the form of a folder phone and looks like a feature phone, but is a high-end version of Qualcomma`s latest application processor, snap-driven 835. It is equipped with two 4.2 inch full- HDD amoladed displays. RAM is 4GB, internal memory is 64GB and supports micr maikeuro SD seullot slots up to 252GB.The rear camera is equivalent to the premium smartphone Galaxy S8, which was released this year with a price tag of 12 million pixels and a iris. The front camera has a capacity of 5 million pixels and a battery of 23 mA.In particular, it attracts attention with the first folder phone that supports Samsung's voice secretary Vicksby. Samsung Electronics has been offering Chinese bigsby services since last month.Samsung is struggling from behind its local counterpart in the Chinese cellular phone market. Samsung Electronics ranked sixth in the Chinese smartphone market with a 3.0 percent share in the second quarter of this year, according to a market research firm Counterpoint Research. It is down by 4.0 % from the same period last year. It is interpreted that the company aims to revive the Chinese market with premium specs while satisfying both the functions of folder phones and smartphones through 2018. In particular, as the price of the items that ordinary people enjoy, such as Jajangmyeon, gimbap, and soju, the price of eating out is higher. According to the National Statistical Office yesterday, the price of meals in November rose 2.6 percent year-on-year. This is twice the overall consumer price increase rate in November (1.3 %). The monthly rate of inflation has continued to rise at the 2-percent level every month. Meanwhile, the overall consumer price increase rate remained at the 1-percent level for the second straight month following February (1.9 %), April (1.9 %), and June (1.9 %). When we looked at the food price hike rate by items in November, the food that ordinary people usually went to was on the rise.[Graphic] The price of gimbap, an item that can make a single meal cheaper than the previous year, jumped nearly seven percent year-on-year, and the price of jjambbong (5.0 percent) and Jajangmyeon (4.8 percent) also rose. Soju, the drink of ordinary people, rose 4.9 percent from a year ago, while beer rose by 3 percent.Pork slices such as sliced raw fish, beef stew (4.9 percent), fried rice (3.8 percent), instant noodles (3.3 percent), and Seolrangtang (3.0 percent) were also more expensive, and cold noodles (2.9 percent) were also increased by more than 3 percent. Among the 39 items out of the total, only 10 were bulgogi (1.2 percent), rice wine (1.2 percent), chicken (1.1 percent), and hamburgers (1.1 percent). "" Overall consumer prices rose at a low rate in October to November due to the base-effects effect, "" said an official at the National Statistical Office, "" while individual service costs, including gimbap, with high overall price contributions, were steadily rising.

"# 1 Hubby student Jang Ji-hun, 23, who graduated from humanities college, security expenses, job security, job security, job security, job security, job opportunities. But their jobs are mostly low-paid jobs, and although universities do not guarantee the future, the world is too tough and tough to deal with. Jang Ji-hun (alias), a high school worker, steps up the stairs to the exit of a subway station in Seoul yesterday. ' Is there really a place for me out there?"" The first job of journalist Jang Ji-hoon, a alias for Ryu Hyo-jin, was a department store in Seoul. She went in as soon as she graduated from high school and worked as a sales manager, earning 1.5 million won a month. After graduating from humanities high school, he passed local colleges, but never enrolled. The tuition for the semester is more than 3 million won, but I felt that the fee was too low to go around paying such a huge fee. ' Rather, I want to go and work fast."" My parents asked me if I should go to college even though I owed them money, "" she said. He was the one who made a living by working part-time as a quick service worker since he was in high school. Hope it's Not Mine Anymore when I entered the military, I quit my department store and found a job after being discharged from service. It was a small, unmanned security firm's sales pitch. It was a closed circuit (CC) TV set that went around the country and listened to set up alarms. It was Monday at 9 a.m. in Jeolla-do and Tuesday at 5pm in the east, and in the west, it was a flash in the east and a flash in the west. Many times, he had to run to work without sleeping or go down to work early the previous day to sleep nearby. I worked like crazy an average of 13 to 15 hours a day. As a result, the monthly salary was 1.1 million won before tax. After the four major insurance premiums were deducted, the amount of money was 960,000 to 9.7 million won. After paying 350,000 won per month and a mobile phone bill, nearly half of my salary disappeared. However, I paid two installment savings accounts that paid 300,000 won per month when I earned operating performance. I just woke up to add to my sister's wedding bill."" I've worked so long I don't even have time to spend, "" said Chang, who was embarrassed by the security company, "" but it was a future job. "" Though the company had to close its doors after eight months to sell its clothing line, the company said, "" If we steadily build a career in the field of security, we hope to make it a lifelong job. "" He had no complaints about working nearly 15 hours a day, and about his low pay. "" I thought I could learn. I wanted to learn all of the skills of the industry and communication. But he wouldn't teach me anything. We had 15 installation crew members, but they only gave us supplementary work like errands. They all say, "" I do. I feel so frustrated about going to a normal job for a long time and living a normal life with a normal salary. It is the dream of Jang Ji-hoon, a high school graduate. Ryu Hyo-jin, a reporter at Jarikyeong University, now charges a total of 9,000-1,000,000 won per month with the installation of road equipment such as utility ships, streetlights and traffic lights. It is to earn a vocational counselor's certificate of qualifications and make time to work in the personnel and work fields. Having to make an immediate living makes him the hardest job of studying these days. The Ministry of Employment and Labor also tried a package that would succeed in finding a job, but gave up because it took only four weeks to complete the first phase of the basic consultation process. The long course from 6 to 12 months to help finding work is complete without any occupation, and the maximum amount of support for job training is 400,000 won for those who can afford to get jobs is 150,000 won. The cost of meals and transportation alone is a tight budget.Recently, I earned 1.8 million won per month working over a year as a sales representative at a famous clothing store. The five-day workweek is set to be ten hours a day, and lunch and dinner was served. If you want to settle down right now, you won't be able to find a job like this. But when I saw my brothers and sisters working four or five years on the same pay as I did, I couldn't see the future. You can't go on like that without having any experience. I don't like service because there is no hierarchy. I'd like to look for a steady job that involves stepping up and getting a promotion, and getting a raise. "" He was asked what kind of monthly wage he felt was satisfactory with. It costs 1.5 million won. If my career builds up later, I will be satisfied with it for three or five years. ‘ Dreams? ’ he laughed and asked. "" I don't really want to be rich and rich. I want to live a normal life with a normal salary in a stable job even if I don't make much money. Not too hard, just plain, just normal…""It's hard to say that the nation's college entrance rate, which is ranked first only on top of the OECD's second-year ranking, has soared to 77.8 % since 2009. It began to shrink in the aftermath of the financial crisis and fell to 60 percent last year, followed by a 0.9 percent decline to 68.9 percent this year. Meanwhile, the employment rate of vocational high schools (specialized high schools + mixed-level high schools), which hit a low low of 16.7 percent in 2009, increased every year and was the first time that it was 50.6 percent this year.As the high cost of tuition, which costs nearly 10 million won a year, and the difficulty of getting a university degree, coupled with the chronic difficulty of finding a university as a reasonable investment point for the future has become increasingly prevalent, the nation's high school diploma crisis has become a source of financial.However, high school seniors, accounting for 20 to 30 percent of the total youth, are not really beneficiaries of the various youth support policies pursued by the central and local governments. Though the talk of youth has sparked an explosion in various youth policies, the ' young man ' is automatically translated as a ' college graduate student ' without being questioned. For example, Seoul Youth Benefit, which provides up to 500,000 won per month for job seeking activities, can only be applied to unemployed youths who are not in school (taking time off from school) or to young workers less than 30 hours per week. Unemployed youth will be eligible for support, but most high school graduates can not really benefit from working long hours and seeking better jobs. Most high school graduates earn money due to the living expenses they face, but they are underpaid and have to work long hours. The labor market is still subject to discrimination against high school graduates and instability in the employment of low-paid and unskilled graduates, as a result, frequent turnover into unrelated jobs and lack of systematic skill accumulation. Over time the low-wage economy will not improve. Undeclared with youth policies, high school working poor are suffering from double poverty : income and time poverty. According to a report by the Seoul Youth Center for Youth Activities, which has poor hope but has obtained on July 1, the "" policy alternatives through high school youth working poor "" has led to parents ' poor and young adults ' hard lives. As if they could not afford to make a costly investment at university or even if they did so, they could not expect sufficient results. They would rather be thrown into the labor market without giving a serious thought. Find a job that can solve economic problems right now with little thought of aptitude, hope, or long-term career development, but it is not easy to form a lasting career under these economic pressures. Furthermore, due to job and business discrimination, there is little opportunity for them to cultivate their skills.According to the report, young people who have graduated from humanities high schools have much harder times in the labor market than in vocational high schools such as Busan High School and Myster High School. Although the schools were preoccupied with raising the employment rate, they hired students as companies unrelated to their aptitude and made it difficult for them to work for a long time, the graduates of the humanities high school had no support whatsoever. A 25-year-old woman who works as a cafe barista with monthly pay of 1.5 million won after graduating from humanities high school, said in an interview with researchers that "" If you get a high school diploma like me, you don't get to work a few hundred thousand won but you get paid a little by half. """" It feels like she's always being kicked out. Stress on that balance. Where should I go for my money? I don't think I always have much choice. If you have a little more time, you have a choice of ' I can reduce this slightly and invest it. ' But I think when it comes to poverty, I can't do this, and I have to do this. So there's pressure, stress, sensitivity, and money chase. I guess so. "" (B, 26, Nam, Cafe Barista, graduating high school) It is hard for high school graduates to build skills through their careers when they move out of the company due to their work and their aptitude in Miss Match. Those who can not stop work due to their immediate livelihood do not have time to make a serious commitment. One store across the street has a sign that says ' Wanted Staff '. Ryu Hyo-jin, a reporter at a high school, said, "" I'm just a kid. "" When I was eight months old, I was starting college. But I didn't even know what kind of pictures or fonts to put in the banners. I accidentally heard from someone else that they're paying me two million won a month to hire a perfect new guy. It's just a college graduate."
"I felt like I had to go to college because I had no experience at all. I wouldn't go to college if I earned 1.5 million to 1.6 million won a month. "" However, this is most desirable, as there are many job changes due to work and pay discrimination. If you work in accounting, you need to organize the Excel file ; if you do the HR business, you are given the Korean file arrangement ; and then you go to college. Recurring simple tasks does not add up to a career, and wages do not go up. When I was working for a construction company, I made a mistake while working for a payroll company. So angry, the managing director says, "" Is it high school, or is it not fair yet? "" And he says, "" Well, you still have to give me a job that fits your age. She thought that if she had three months as an intern, she would have become a full-time job and decided to get a salary of less than 1.1 million won after taxes, but the internship period was extended to six months. Work that lasted until 9 p.m. was too heavy, but discrimination was most difficult because I was "" too young "". "" Since I'm young, I just got another team to work, too. Our department's quality control team called in from the manager to make him do the night work without having him work. "" It was not easy to deal with such discrimination when he was a senior in high school. Compared to college graduates, the young age group interacts with high school graduates in a society where the hierarchy of college graduates exerts absolute influence on their age, and exposes them to overlapping discrimination, neglect and abuse. Oh, who has changed to a dental equipment supplier for a year, is planning to go to a junior college to study Flower Design Technology next year. For high school seniors who are suffering from discrimination and have cut short their futures, it is also an inevitable choice for them to go on to college. Sun Hyung-jin (alias, 23), who worked at a web agency as an industrial function worker after graduating from specialized high school, is currently a senior at night. Having been interested in computer programming since he was a child, he won several tournaments and went to specialized high school despite his parents ' opposition. Even current companies that produce and manage official homepages have joined us with the intention of making a lifetime of high school education. But the decision was shaken to see the managing director make a public statement saying, "" What did you do when they were out of the four-year college? "" "" What I'm learning at university now is completely useless at work. I'm going there because of one diploma. If there is a way to get a single diploma from four years of tuition at once, I'd rather not pick one, "" and after three years, one month's salary, one month's end of project, no pay, no pay. "" A life of doing what I like to do in a job with an annual salary of 30 million won, being a substitute, an overstatement, and a manager. Can I have such a life? """" He mumbled the end of his words. "" I keep getting scared when I think about the future. I don't have confidence. I'm constantly frightened. "" "" The most important thing for high school seniors and the poor in poor families is to find the path to a career that fits right. Jinro Ballantines is vital to support young people who lack both time and income. We need time to find our dream, "" Ryu said. "" Now you can learn from a small salary and have a career that actually helps you. You can never get to know anyone. I've worked for 11 different jobs in five years, but I was able to get a small raise in salary only from the Photoshop involved that I studied. I used to sell factories at night. But that won't do any good later. "" (E, 25, graduating from specialized high school) career exploration and career formation, with two of the most sustainable lives of high school kids. In particular, graduates of humanities high schools frequently move from cafe baristas to department store sales jobs, call center counselors, and jobs that are unrelated to their work, continuing their work histories without looking for long-term career paths. Because of the weak social networks, they can not obtain proper information about their careers and have no time to discuss the issue even in difficult times. They are like islands outside the school.To address these issues, the report said, "" We have resolved the problem of finding the first way that high school workers and the poor would face entering the labor market. We have a policy that will support a certain general proficiency at the early stage. "" Programs to seek careers and opportunities for daily experience will be provided.The report especially stressed, "" As high school graduates should seek to free themselves from the economic and time constraints that would allow them to seek their own careers, it is urgent to seek out policies that would allow them to pursue their own careers, "" adding, "" Youth allowance in Seoul. The Seoul Youth Gap Project, which allows young people to explore the career path by traveling, volunteering, internships and starting businesses over a period of time, is currently under discussion this summer by the Seoul Youth Council."" Give me a time to work and get some income support, so I can see what you want to do. "" Unresignedly I think high school students give up a lot of their time. So I want you to help me through that. "" What would it be like to have less income than what it is like to ask young people to spend hours living and not to ask them what kind of work they do. "" Travel, traveling abroad. My friends tell me that you are always busy. "" When I worked with my ears to the point of bleeding, I took a trip to Japan with my youngest brother for a week. It was great. Oh, I can see why people are going abroad. "" "" I want to go backpacking for just three days without worrying about money. Living in Korea is so hard and exhausting.

"▽ Body Image field = It has been a week since the official release of the iPhone X (10) on July 24. It was not sure whether the company will succeed in the event due to high prices, technical flaws, or component yields, but it was estimated that 120,000 soft landing would have been achieved in the first four days.However, the opinions of users are still divided ; they have purchased an iPhone X and used it for a week. Is the iPhone X really a defective product, apart from the question of price?The operation was so simple and delicious that the iPhone X ordered as a reservation on July 24 was delivered. I could feel the heavy taste of hands. Before turning on the power, I looked around the terminal and looked at the design. Glass, feeling smooth and no superfluity. After turning on the power, the ' notch ' design in the front was reviewed. She didn't feel too good when held horizontally, but she felt irritated when she turned over. But now, a week later, the notch doesn't give us much sense of difference.The iPhone X was the first home button missing model. I thought it would be inconvenient to operate the device, but that was groundless speculation. The controls have become simpler and more intuitive than before. The bar up was used to send running apps to the background and provided easy access to the apps in the background. It was convenient to switch the app by turning the bar to the left and right, like ' Back ' or ' Forward ' on an Internet browser.At the top, the notch design was hard to get a lot of information. There was an inconvenience of stipping the right notch down to see how much battery remains. Rather, it was thought that it would be better to remove the carrier carrier on the left notch and display other information.Body image area The face ID setup screen that was first introduced in the iPhone X. Eye observation provides increased security. / Photo = Park Heung-soon's ID … The face ID which caused worries of many people who passed the test for security and speed was a series of surprises. The setup allowed the user to select the mode they wanted, between convenience and security, by allowing the viewing mode to be switched on and off. Faith correctly recognized the wearer's hats, yawns, and even drinks. The security was also good enough to pass the grade. Dozens of people tried to unlock their face ID during the week, but nobody could. Reporters sometimes had difficulty unlocking their smartphones after waking up in the morning.However, since the security review on the face ID of commercial financial institutions has not been completed, it will take some time before it can be used for financial services. Samsung Card users were able to log in with their face ID but blocked the function on July 28 because of a lack of security verification.The camera performance of the iPhone X in the body image area was quite satisfactory. / Photo = Park Heung-soon : Although rumors were aroused, it was not possible to find a problem, so what about other new features and components? The first OLED screen in the iPhone series was used for the first time in the world. The display was also able to express the difficult colors of black and purple without any problem, and there were no green gates with green lines on the screen. There was no cold gate where the screen was inoperative or turned off in an environment close to 0°C. The issue was not received at home as of late November.Dualcell's battery of 2716 mAh was also impressed with its abundance. I watched music, video, and news articles on my smartphone about two hours into the office, but the battery remained about 90 percent. However, the battery is likely to lose its ability as it is consumed.The camera's performance was also relatively good. The dual camera on the back gave a distinctive look to the iPhone. However, for the character mode, the results were incomplete, as in beta. In particular, the stage lighting and stage lighting mono mode produced effects that were completely incompatible with a background that was cleared by the correct placement of characters within a central circle.The iPhone X's use for a week was not entirely satisfactory. It is not encouraging or stopping the purchase of an iPhone X. However, they were written to verify rumors surrounding the products. Whoever says anything, the choice is the customer's. There are 161 private schools .... Isn't it the feeling of traffic jams abroad? '' "" Since the baby is shrinking every year, each of us has no choice but to go to Andong to spend our children's money. ""Last year, 74 babies were born in Yeongyang-gun (7,500 persons), the smallest number in the country besides Ulleung County (38 persons). He was born in 2000, but has dropped to less than 100 since the 2007 financial crisis. In the 10th year, the number of freshmen who were born under 100 dropped drastically to 279 in middle school and 539 in elementary school, while 423 in high school. High school students earn an average of 141 students per year, while elementary and middle school students earn an average of 90.The number of places where the baby can not be heard is increasing. According to the National Statistical Office on July 1, 52 counties in Korea did not have 300 babies last year. More than six out of ten babies (64.2 %) are born with less than 300 babies. In the urban areas, less than 300 people were born in two cities (Busan, Jung-gu, Busan, and Taebaek, Gangwon Province). 300 newborns per year are commonly used as a standard by which they can operate an maternity unit. It is the first time in 16 years since Korea's low birth rate of 1.3 children in 2001 that 64 percent of rural areas have been threatened with starvation.Only eight babies were born in 2000 (Uljin, Incheon, Ongjin, Gyeonggyang, GunwI, Cheongsong, Muju, Jinan, and Jangsu-gun in North Jeolla Province), but the number increased by 6.5 times in the 16th year. As the number of newborns is expected to decrease by about 50,000 from last year, the number of babies under 300 is expected to grow further.Last year, less than 100 people were born in Ulleung County, Yeongyang-gun, North Gyeongsang Province, 27 out of 100, and 23 out of 200. As North Gyeongsang Province has the most, it has 10 districts, 9 areas in South Jeolla Province, 8 in Gangwon Province, 7 in South and North Jeolla Province, 5 in North Chungcheong Province, 4 in South Chungcheong Province and 2 in Incheon.Jeonbuk was born in three of the 11 counties (Inseo-Cheongcheon-Cheolwon and Chilgok), and not three of the 13 regions were born in North Gyeongsang Province (Seongju, Uljin, and Chilgok).Namhae of South Gyeongsang Province had 140 newborns last year, with 722 deaths, resulting in five times more deaths than newborns. In Goesan, North Chungcheong Province, the number of deaths is 4.1 times higher than that of newborns (120). That means more people go to funerals than going to a rock feast. In reality, all 52 deaths were higher than those of newborns, except in Hwacheon and Yanggu, Gangwon Province, where among the 54 cities, counties and districts where less than 300 are born in reality, there are many young soldiers. As the total population is also decreasing compared to 2010, the region is on the brink of extinction.Most of these areas don't even have gynecologists to deliver. According to the National Health Insurance Corporation, 64 (79 percent) of 81 counties do not have maternity services nationwide. Mothers often have to go to the city for more than an hour to have their babies. Including the number of newborns and distance from nearby cities, the ministry is trying to attract gynecologists to eight counties in North Gyeongsang Province, seven in Gangwon Province and six in South Jeolla Province. The number of gynecologists who gave birth to children was 607 in 2016, nearly half of which was in 2006.The area adjacent to Gangwon-do called Cheorwon, Hwacheon, Yanggu, and Inje University are non-smoking areas. In order to have a baby, pregnant women must go to Chuncheon or Sokcho. Park (34), who gave birth to a baby two years ago, said, "" I went to Chuncheon once a month to have my baby checked out, and my husband and I had to take a day off to see if we could afford our vacation. ""There are no gynecologists in the cities of Uiryeong-Hamyang and Cheongsong in South Gyeongsang Province, so mothers should go to other regions to see the doctor before she leaves. Changnyeong, South Gyeongsang Province, has a gynecologist, but she never gives birth. Because birth can cause emergencies, and an anesthesiologist and nurse are also needed for delivery.Hongcheon County, where 400 new babies are born, has had to go to Chuncheon or Wonju to give up delivery to a gynecologist. If you give up delivery in Hongcheon, the nation`s capital city with a population of 70,000, the number of areas without gynecologists could grow in the future, said an official at the Korea Obstetrics & Gynecology Association.Correct : `` We have 52 residents and less than 300 newborns in addition to the maternity ward, '' published on the front page of ▲ and BonjI A on December 2, according to the article, 10,750 people live in Yeongyang-gun.

"Incheon Incheon~Seo-incheon IC public road is packed with traffic. In Incheon city, the Seoul-Incheon expressway [Yonhap news agency] called for abolition of toll fees [Yonhap news agency report] Kang Jong-koo said is on the highway toll. It is absurd to continue to collect the toll even when the Incheon area of the Gyeongin Expressway has been converted to a regular road. Incheon Metropolitan Council announced on July 2 that it has proposed a resolution urging the abolition of the toll fees on the Gyeongin Expressway. The city council strongly called for the abolition of the toll fees on the Gyeongin Expressway, which has long lost its motorway capability due to a steep traffic jam and has already been recouped in terms of investment costs. Gyeongin Expressway, the first Korean highway, has received more than twice the investment since it was opened in 1968 after collecting transportation fees. Since its opening, the toll has been imported at 688.3 billion won until the end of 2016, 2.4 times larger than the construction, maintenance, and maintenance costs. Drivers are complaining that paying 900 won per day for regular trips can cause severe traffic jams. It takes more than an hour to run the entire Donggyin Expressway from Incheon to the New Moon IC, but it is not uncommon for it to take longer than an hour to commute. Traffic is expected to get worse. As the 10.45 kilometer-long section from Incheon to western Incheon IC was switched to public roads on December 1, the speed limit was also lowered from 100 kilometers per hour to 60-80 kilometers per hour. If 10 more access roads are installed on the section during the first half of next year as planned, traffic jams will worsen as more vehicles are arriving. You must keep paying when things get worse. The Bupyung fare center is not located in an average roadway construction project, but on a highway managed by the Korea Highway Corporation. Public opinion had been in the past claiming to abolish pricing, but the Constitutional Court ruled that toll collection was constitutional. If the highway that has completed the payback of the investment is empty, the imbalance will worsen, the court said in its case of a petition in the 2014 petition.

In 2015, the total payment rate at the high-end bars decreased 3.1 percent from 2014, but the total payment amount at the entertainment outlets in the third quarter of this year decreased to 4.45 trillion won, compared with the same period in the third quarter of 2015.

"Special forces brigade … Location of special forces … Special forces forces U.S. Ranger, Delta Verez and the South Korean Navy, which have planned and crept into North Korea last year to assassinate hostile forces or rescue prisoners of war. The army created a Special Forces unit under the Special Forces (Special Forces) on July 1. This unit is designed to destroy the North Korean command and WMD such as nuclear and missile in case of emergency. It originally planned to create a secret nuclear weapons program in 2019, but after North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test last September, the military said it planned to launch a massive retaliation plan (KMPR), which would be necessary in case of an attack on the South. The special forces brigade that emerged as part of the KMPR, the so-called beheading force, was the day. Military officials said they have formed troops two years earlier than planned, and can not comment specifically on the role and role of such units, but played a much more important role in repressing North Korea`s provocations and counteracting their role. We will establish itself as a key force for self-reliant defense, along with the concept of a preemptive strike against the North, Kill Chain and the Korean Missile Defense system. Park Gyeong-min, a journalist at the North's ruling Workers ' Party, was quoted as saying that when the plan was unveiled at the end of last year, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un greatly increased the number of bodyguards. This means that the Special Forces are threatened. As the Special Forces will carry out secret operations, the military maintains strict security on that day. In addition to the venue for the opening ceremony, the two teams did not disclose the formation of a unit or location. However, considering the fact that the brigade is different, some say that the number of noncommissioned officers who were promoted by military officers or more was around 1000. It is also said that special forces brigade members chose soldiers close to human weapons. They plan to have fast mobility and advanced equipment. Military authorities have modified the C-130 carrier and its large helicopter, the CH-47s, to be used exclusively for special duty brigades. U.S. soldiers have dedicated aircraft, helicopters, vehicles and boats, but Korea will first renovate existing equipment, said a military official. As a small group of people perform operations together, they are also equipped with a counter-guided grenade launcher (a weapon shaped like a grenade), a heavy machine gun, and a small unmanned aerial vehicle. The Defense Ministry requested a budget to purchase a 40-millimeter, six-chamber revolver for its special operations. The crew also uses specially manufactured yashights and rifle drills, as well as underwater and ground. They will have remote communication and a transmitting device to and from headquarters. Military officials also wrote, "" Navy Special Forces (UDTSEAAL) that were sent to the rescue operation of Samho Jewelry that was hijacked by pirates in January 2011, "" adding, "" We can also send and receive information from remote units. "" The Air Force created an air intelligence unit yesterday to monitor the North's key military facilities. The number of students who have dropped to more than 2,000 in the first half of the year, and if the trend continues in the second half, it will be less than 90,000. The status of the financial institutions ' workforce on the Bank of Korea's economic statistics system on July 2 shows that as of the end of the second fiscal quarter, the average bank has 90,000 to 1028 employees. The figure decreased by 2402 from 93,430 in the fourth quarter of last year. In the first and second quarters, 2074 and 328 people left the banks. The Bank of Korea's general banking statistics differ from the Financial Supervisory Service's estimate of the statistics, including state-run banks. FSS estimates that at the end of June, the number of bank employees stood at 114,502.The number of bank employees has continued to decline in recent years. After hitting a record high of 106,633 in 2008, he tumbled. There were 4,477 massive retirements in 2010. It has increased for two consecutive years since 2011 and 2012, but has decreased for the fourth year in a row since 2013. Between 2013 and the second fiscal quarter of this year, 14,468 people participated.This is the result of multiple factors, such as the reduction of the number of credit card users and the replacement of human resources according to technological developments, in the wake of the financial crisis. This year, 101 stores were down in the first half. In 2015, 106 bank stores and 159 bank stores disappeared in 2016.If the number of employees who decreased in the second half of the year exceeds 1,000, the number of bank employees could fall below 90,000 for the first time. In the second half, Woori Bank reduced its work force by about 800 due to the request. The NHCF began accepting applications for voluntary retirement last month. The targets are all people who apply for the wage peak system and employees aged over 40 who have worked at the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation bank for more than 10 years.However, the fact that banks have expanded the size of their new jobs this year from last year is a factor that can offset the reduction in labor. The launch of Kakao Bank in July is also expected to have an impact. Lee Jin-kyung, reporter of the Korea Media Daily ljin@segye.com and Global Media Daily News, Seoul's mobile phone retailer, abolished the "" cap "" on July 11. However, the discount rate for mobile phone users was raised by two hundred thousand won per month One hand is set to provide nearly 330,000 won of aid to the nation. Consumers who had hoped to buy cheaper handsets by reviving competition by removing the cap on their products were also unhappy.Mobile phone companies reported on Dec. 2 that although the subsidy cap of the Mobile Distribution Structure Improvement Act expired as of Oct. 1, there were only three cases in which it surpassed the existing ceiling.KT allocated 345,000 won in support to the country`s mid-sized mobile phone Galaxy 7 on Oct. 1, the first day it lifted the cap. Samsung Electronics ' Galaxy S8+122GB product support was raised to 372,000 on November 17. This is the first time that a premium phone with a circulation of more than 900,000 won has been given an extra subsidy.SK Telecom also raised the subsidy for its Galaxy S8+122GB product by up to 340,000 won on Nov. 21.Two KT companies allocated more than 330,000 won in support after the cap was lifted, while one SK Telecom provided support. LG U-Plus has not given more than 330,000 won in support for its first 15-month-old handset.Instead, Iton-sab sharply increased the amount of money it would support mobile phones 6 and Galaxy Note 5 to 600,000 to 700,000 won. However, it was not illegal before the cap on aid was lifted. The reason is that the cap is not applied to terminals older than 15 months after their release.Meanwhile, the industry evaluates that the initial subsidy for premium phones with more than one million won in output is only around 200,000 won, which is no different from the previous plans to abolish the cap.Apple's iPhone X-Experience With MomentNews1 and News1, the mobile industry analyzed that the move was "" a step forward. "" Even if the cap is lifted, there is no reason for the agency to compete for support.Even in the early days of enforcing the law, it was common for mobile operators to face off in a number shift market, in which they stole customers from rival companies. However, recently, more and more "" device changes "" customers are changing their handsets without switching carriers.The average number of moves per month was 573,379 during the first 10 months of this year, according to the ministry. On the other hand, the average monthly change of device is 786,453, or more than 200,000.With more subscribers to the device changes, telcos have also not had to pay a lot of money for the so-called home rabbit, said an official of the mobile phone industry. Most of the money saved from the fund flows to distribution channels such as distributors and retailers.In other words, it raises the "" sales incentive "" by paying distribution networks instead of increasing the amount of support that the agencies and manufacturers pay directly to consumers. Distribution networks strategically use the money to support customers, leaving at least their margins intact, while the rebate turns into a so-called illegal subsidy, resulting in consumer discrimination and harm.Some analyze that the discount system on the option contract, which was adopted with the implementation of the law, is a factor that inhibits the increase in the amount of support provided by employers.Currently, the 25 percent rate of discount is calculated on a government basis. As the system itself is called the "" subsidy equivalent discount, "" the rate of discount is bound to rise as the amount of support the agency gives to consumers grows.Most of all, as the discount rate rose from 20 percent from September 15 to 25 percent, the gap between support and fee discounts widened, the number of customers who choose discount on alternative medicine has increased."" Customers often use the high rate system over 60,000 won for expensive premium phones, and most of them do not choose to pay a discount off, "" said an official of the mobile phone industry.The regulatory authorities plan to keep a watchful eye on the market to prevent overheated competition between the companies even after the cap is lifted. After the cap is lifted, we have been preparing for overheating of the market by operating a monitoring team to prepare for possible overheating of the market, said an official at the Korea Communications Commission.Sho 218 @. see news and photo on PyeongChang 2018.

It was confirmed that the six F-22s arrived at the first combat flight group of the Gwangju Air Force. The stealth fighter penetrates an enemy radar network and hits a key facility with a maximum speed of more than 2.5 per minute. The operational range is 2,177 kilometers.U.S. aircraft used for training in formation (Gwangju = Yonhap News Agency) Park Cheol-hong is an F-35A, F-35B early warning aircraft (F-3C) for the F-3C airborne combat aircraft. Some of the air power, including F-35A and EA-18G, was deployed at Osan and Gunsan bases to prepare for training. U.S. strategic arms are scheduled to be deployed on the Korean Peninsula sequentially until July 3. The F-35B, in which 12 teams will participate, will reportedly be sent to Japan from IwakunI base in order to return to Japan without landing. With an operational radius of about 800 kilometers, the F-35B has a maximum speed of 1.6 Mach. The F-22 and F-35B are equipped with various kinds of armor, and were able to enter the airspace above the Pacific Ocean within 10 minutes of takeoff from the Osan base and within 20 minutes from Gunsan.

Located at a diameter of 9.14m and a thickness of 1.83m, it contains surveillance radar antenna and fia - ate identifier (IFF) and TADIL-C antenna. Do 6 revolutions per minute. In particular, E-3 can function as a ground intercept control center, such as sending target data directly to an interceptor and controlling it, so it functions as an airborne command and control center. The electronics maker, EA-18G, has an anti-communication jamming device, an AIM-120 airborne missile for self-defense, and an AGM-88 (HARM) air-to-radar missile for enemy radar attacks. It is an aircraft capable of communication monitoring, communication interruption by enemy aircraft, and disruption of communication system.E-3 Air Force participating in non-selective ace training is F-15K, KF-16, F-5 fighter jets, FA-50 light aircraft, and KA-1 About 230 aircraft are scheduled to launch and train at eight bases in the two countries. North Korea plans to conduct intensive training such as hitting major targets, missile loaded fire vehicles (TEL), long-range artillery strikes against North Korea, and blocking special forces in the North, including nuclear weapons and missiles. The State and Night Drill is performed using the combined Operations Order (Pre-ATO), which assigns a mission to Korea-U.S. aircraft to strike down more than 700 North Korean core targets in the event. This is the first time that the Pre-ATO application policy has been revealed during the latest joint training. It is analyzed that although planned before North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile (ICP-15) launch, it is a strong response that reflects the situation of the missile. hapyry@yna.co.kr As the river flowed down the heron and the egrets came back. The Geumgang River did not change much when Gongjubo Bay opened its gates in June, but when Sejongbo and BocharajI of Baekje opened its gates on July 13, the river revealed its rotten face in the water. The water, which had been blocked off for five years, made the Geumgang River look terrible. Sejongbo lowered its water level by about 1.5 meters and the river bed was turned into a Pearl with foul smells of bad Toro. Pearl near Sejongbo was piled inexplicably thick. On Pearl, you could easily see the real thing, the four-water water grid designated by the Ministry of Environment. Pollution, such as sewers, is visible only in heavy water. The edge of Sejongbo River was so deep that even the Environment Ministry and water resources workers could not work on it because of the depth of the sand. A sand bank larger than a playground was formed at the center of the Geumgang River main stream and Yugucheon Stream downstream of Gongjubo on July 28. Daejeon Chungnam Province Green United, however, he said he saw hope in despair. For example, a sandbank revealed at the point of meeting between Yugucheon Stream and Geumgang Main Stream downstream of Gongjubo. As the river's water level dropped after opening the sluice gates, water from the well began to wash away the earth and clean sand began to accumulate. The sand dunes were also under Wangjingyo Bridge upstream of Baekjebo. The snail was also seen again. The scene that the flowing Geumgang River changed was the bird. Birds, which had disappeared due to the four-river restoration project, have been searching again. Kim Jong-sul, a daily reporter monitoring the Geumgang ecosystem, said, "" After the four-river restoration project, the number of birds come mostly from the deep waters, and the number of fresh cormorants looking for food such as egrets and from low water sources has increased. We also saw dozens of white-eye birds that disappeared when the sand dunes were submerged.The sand dune looks under Wangjingyo Bridge, upstream of Baekjebo. Private advisory groups for monitoring situations at the Ministry of Environment are excluded from those groups of activists and environmental groups that only participate in academics and monitor the site. Yang Heung-mo, head of the Green Community Office in South Chungcheong Province, said after the opening of the gate, monitoring is central to the administrative bodies, and sector monitoring conducted by related agencies is not shared with citizens at all. In order to revive the rivers, they must be different from the four-river project that has been led by officials and some experts. We should listen to the voices of the people and communicate with them before we can achieve the right thing. Choi Ye-rin, journalist, Please be my best friend in the Hankyoreh!

""" I have two children, but my boyfriend is only blaming me. "" "" Are you sure you want to have a baby? "" "" Social and human rights killer "" -- "" I'm afraid I'll get caught by a media outlets. "" A graduate who joined the Dupuli meeting belatedly showed an enthusiastic fondness for Lee, and the two soon became lovers. It was from the west that the two of them had a crack when they had an unexpected child. The 6-year-old had told Lee numerous times that "" Let's get married, "" but when he heard of Lee's pregnancy, he first mentioned abortion. That is why she is not ready to get married. On that day, Lee even had to face a complaint from Mr. A about how he failed to make a proper calculation on the date of ovulation. Lee said, "" After my boyfriend's argument, I had an abortion. "" After the surgery, I was asked to go on a trip to refresh myself, he said, My boyfriend tried to have sex with me that night when the fallout remained. Lee broke up with A the day she had an abortion. "" I don't think I have any emotion about having to spoil my baby because I was young, "" Lee said. He said, "" I have two children, but my boyfriend is only blaming me. "" The back room was mine, the woman. Yoo Ji-seon, alias, also lay alone on a maternity table four years ago. Already, the boyfriend had cut off and disappeared. Yoo had a baby soon after starting a relationship with his two-year-old boy whom he met at the club. Yoo said, "" If you make money, you can raise one child. "" However, B was indifferent to her. The last thing I heard was, "" Maybe that child is not mine. "" After that day, he lost touch without an apology, Yoo said. "" It was so hard to feel betrayed by love and to feel sorry for having to leave a life in the womb, "" he said. The government is set to investigate the pregnancy interruption, which was suspended for eight years, next year. They will question the necessity of revising abortion laws. The current legislation places all legal responsibilities on women and leaves the responsibility of the nation and the men entirely absent, the head of the Civil Affairs Department said on July 26. ▽ New Seoul = "" Abortion abolition for all "" = Members of the joint acts against abortion and members of the Women's civil society group call for an abortion in front of the steps of the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts in Seoul on July 9. Most of the women who experienced an termination of their pregnancy at the remarks made by the head of the national team on November 10, 2001, were sympathetic. The reality is that although women and men have made children together, the responsibility for abortion is that more women have to bear. Under the current law, women who have performed pregnancy termination due to unwanted pregnancies are punished for abortion. Only sexually transmitted or sexually transmitted diseases are allowed to terminate a pregnancy. Women who have performed pregnancy termination for other reasons are subject to jail term of less than one year or fines of up to two million won. Women who experience termination are also socially criticized as "" killers. "" On the other hand, men are morally criticized but rarely subject to legal sanctions. Women are also relatively more likely to live with feelings of guilt and fear of being seen by others. Having had her baby due to an artificial pregnancy, C said, I had a baby from my boss while dating. Since then, I have had to leave the company. D, who is also experienced, said, "" Whenever I talk about my plans with my boyfriend for a wedding, I feel sorry, "" adding, "" I would have told him to be honest, but around. "" I feel uneasy about my boyfriend knowing about his past several times a day, he added. Experts advise that the government needs to change the social atmosphere in which women are held responsible for the termination of the pregnancy, along with the discussion of the abolition or revision of relevant laws. They say that a social consensus should be reached to strengthen men's sense of responsibility and improve the human rights of women at the underprivileged. Kim Hye Jung Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center who said illegal abortion, contraception, pregnancies, abortions, job insecurity and responsibility that must be all concerns, such as internal disease who can't speak at home.Women turning to ""and"" illegal abortion is abolished, the man's sense of responsibility to actively strengthening social discussions, expected.

Collecting video news. Be friends with YTN [Master of Public News Agency (c) before you sign on to the Prosecution&Commissions ' Guide. Judge Oh Min-seok at the Seoul Central District Court dismissed the arrest warrant for former deputy chief Choi early that morning, explaining the progress of the investigation, family relations between the suspect and the reason of his alleged involvement in the arrest, and the degree of his need for explanation. Looking into the reasons for his dismissal, the court appears to have acknowledged that Choi's guilt was partially justified. Choi, a former deputy head of the culture and art and illegal surveillance of citizens and public officials, including the former president's special inspection iseokssu operating circumstances involved in the exclusive (blacklist) list supported the prosecution.Turned out to be much the result of an specific. The court raised questions on the extent to which former deputy chief Choi was involved in such crimes. It is questionable whether Choi, who was in charge of the NIS, played any role as Woo is at the center of the suspicion and former NIS director Choo Myung-ho, who was already detained, actually acted as an activist. In fact, former Deputy Director Choi acknowledged that the report on the investigation of the former special inspectors before the arrest of the arrest warrant and operation of the blacklist was partially accepted, but it was only to the general purpose of NIS. However, some legal circles point out that Choi has been at the center of the NIS ' domestic information and had a strong relationship with Woo, a law school colleague at Seoul National University based on personal connections. If the fact that former Deputy Chairman Choi was convicted of a crime is called for, the extent to which he participated will not be taken lightly either. Prosecutors, however, have raised several cases of arrest of high-ranking government officials for their operation of the blacklist, which was judged as an anti-Conspiratorial crime to suppress freedom of expression and thought. In addition to those above the ministerial level, including former presidential chief of staff Kim Ki-choon and former Culture and Sports Minister Cho Yoon-sun, vice ministerial secretaries including Shin Dong-cheol are also arrested on the blacklist. As the warrant of Choe, who is widely accused of overlap with Woo, was rejected, the prosecution is now adding a new set of charges against former special inspectors, Lee and other charges of conducting the blacklist and conducting illegal inspections. Woo said, "" There are growing suspicions of a new corruption, such as the operation of a blacklist of science and technology companies. Now that the arrest warrant for Choe`s aide was dismissed as a mere excuse to "" participate, "" and the explanation of the crime itself has not been acknowledged to a certain extent, it is only a dim prospect of Woo's future arrest. cha@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"

Overcoming the ashes of the Korean War, Korea is on the brink of breaking the $ 30,000 per capita income threshold. This is a staggering 447 times bigger than the 1953 ($ 67) truce agreement. Due to the decline in the won-dollar exchange rate and the rebound in the growth rate due to strong exports, the company is likely to reach more than $ 9000 this year and enter the $ 30,000 level next year. However, major seasonal industries other than semiconductors, such as shipbuilding, steel and petrochemicals, are increasingly narrowing their gap with emerging economies. The discovery of new growth engines in the fourth industrial revolution is also blocked by various regulations, making it hard to find a breakthrough. ○ According to the provisional national income of the Bank of Korea (BOK), the per capita income this year is estimated to be $ 29,561. The nominal GNI increased by 3.4 % in the third quarter (July to September) from the previous quarter ; when the current quarter sees the same level of growth as the previous quarter, the average rate for people will be 11.44 % (same month). If we succeed in achieving 3 percent growth next year and consumer price increases of around 2 percent, it will be okay to achieve $ 30,000 per capita income, a central bank official said. Having developed a high-growth myth, Korea went into a slump during the 1997 financial crisis. It plunged 33.8 percent to $ 7989 the following year from $ 12,059 in 1997. The main reason was a sudden rise in the foreign exchange rate due to the foreign exchange market confusion. It was not until 2003, six years after the foreign exchange crisis, that an export rebound helped the nation achieve per capita income of $ 10,411. In developed countries, ' $ 30,000 ' is perceived as the boundary line between consumption patterns and lifestyle. There is even a story to be said that "" If the national income exceeds $ 20,000, you can go golfing, go horseback riding, and if it is over $ 30,000, go by yacht. "" According to the World Bank, there are only 27 countries that earn more than $ 30,000 per capita last year. It took the leading countries an average of 8.2 years to make the transition from $ 20,000 to $ 30,000. It took Japan, Germany, and Australia five years and the United States nine years. Korea has not exceeded the $ 30,000 threshold this year, 11 years after it collected $ 795 in 2006. Because of this, concerns have been mounting over whether Korea may fall into the trap of the "" middle aged nations. "" ○ The key problem for future growth engines is the future So far, it has reached the bottom of the $ 30,000 mark with a "" catch up strategy "" to catch up with advanced countries. Experts point out that the Korean economy has weakened, however, to the point that its potential economic growth rate has dropped below 3 percent. China and Southeast Asia are already catching up with Korea in the traditional manufacturing industries that have led the Korean economy such as shipbuilding and steel. Thanks to the semiconductor boom, exports in November were at an all-time high of $ 49.07 billion, and continued to grow for the 13th straight month, but the weak structures depending on semiconductors showed little improvement. Some point out that instead of sticking to the $ 30,000 figure, one should focus more on the quality of life such as creating jobs and improving polarization. Koreans ` income is highly variable depending on the exchange rate situation, said Sung Tae-yoon, an economics professor at Yonsei University. We should not be carried away by the impending $ 30,000, but focus calmly on the economic situation and job creation policies in the future.

"[Donga Ilbo Cover Story on Toyopan] [Refugee Application for Refugee in Korea : 30,000 People in the Age of Refugee] (196.68 or less) ; Professional boxer, who won the gold medal in the March 25, was representing South Korea ; and received refugee status in the 2003 ; and won. Even now, he is fortunate in that 9,000 people from various countries are waiting for refugee status. However, the process of crossing the border in search of basic human rights was not smooth. Paul Biya, president (84) rule with an iron fist for three to five years, Africa and Cameroon's capital Yaounde. A 20-year-old man who lives here with his grandmother without her parents enlisted as a boxer in 2002. After leaving school at 16 and only doing so, his brothers told him, "" If you box in the army, you get home for your paycheck. "" However, the young man lived as a slave, not a boxer in the army. Rather than pay him a salary or a house, he was beaten habitually. When he tried to run away to feed his family, he could return to his harsh Mongolia. In October 2015, the opportunity for freedom was arrived. She participated in the World Military Sports Festival, which was held in Mungyeong, North Gyeongsang Province. It was thrilling to think that the Komeroonian`s military hand would not reach Korea. The coaches were preoccupied with the other games on the afternoon of the end. He quietly left the accommodation with a colleague and only a game allowance in his pocket. Running recklessly into town, the grandmother and the little daughter grew up, but gritted their teeth, ' We have to leave to save the family. ' He blindly asked the man on the road to Seoul in short English. It was a deep night when two young men reached Seoul by bus. He immediately applied for refugee status to the authorities, but was dismissed for lack of evidence of persecution when he was returned. To be recognized as a refugee, I had to explain sensitive contents in detail, but I lacked someone to help me interpret at the time, he said. My dream is to become a champion who represents not only Korea but also Asia with boxing, and live happily with my family, he said. The number of people who apply for refugee status reached 30,000 at the end of last month, just like that of Mount Lee. The Ministry of Justice estimates more than 100,000 people in five years. However, only 767 people have accumulated refugee status. The refugees are already on the brink of becoming refugees, but the domestic laws and the screening system to protect them are still the same. There are many voices saying that "" real refugees "" should be properly rescued and that "" fake refugees "" should be filtered out properly.▼ Non-Criticise Review - Processing Delay - Human Rights Ignore ... Depression and suicidal urges ▼ refugees received photographs of their home country of refuge. Independent activist Sadar, who shows Kashmiri independence protests, Firan Nur with photos of Syrian civil war, and anti-government activist Muhammad Karricher, who took pictures of Egyptian repression, protected the refugees.Sadar, a 30-something young man who works in a law office in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, was a Kashmiri independence activist. Kashmir, northwest of India, was split in two by India and Pakistan when the British, who conquered India, withdrew in 1947. It looks like the Korean Peninsula, which was divided into the U.S. and the Soviet Union after the liberation in 1945. Seeing the horror of the girls being raped and kidnapped by the occupying forces, Mr. Sadar decided to fight for independence. As a member of the party, he led an anti-government rally by posting a message to the media for freedom. Then in 2014, Pakistani police issued a warrant. As his colleagues were executed one after another, he decided to escape. I quickly picked up my fake passport and loaded myself into the plane. The place where I flew was Incheon. "" I'm glad to be here. It's similar to us in history. There are many friends who sympathize with my pain. "" Like Mr. Sadar, refugees are the immigrants who escape from their home countries, resist dictatorships and civil war. South Korea will grant refugee status to those who face clear threats when they are returned after screening in accordance with the refugee law of 2013.Refugees who entered the country to avoid the threat of missing out real refugees due to a lack of expert judges ` expertise or interpretation errors are not recognized as regular refugees due to loopholes. So was Mr. Sadar. For Mr. Sadar, Incheon was just a place to win. Ten minutes before flying to Australia, where his comrades were staying, immigration officials stopped him. It was because of the fake passport. `` I will file for refugee in Australia. Call a lawyer to apply for refugee status here, too. "" He shouted in English, but only rang in the air. Eventually, he was confined to a foreigner's shelter. The Geneva Convention on Refugees says it does not consider the use of fake passports to survive as a refugee as illegal. Is it possible for someone like me to question a fake passport? "" Getting a refugee application was a big deal. Each time I heard the harsh words of the shelter staff, "" If I receive an application, I will be kicked out. "" After making a fuss with the staff, he got hold of the refugee application. The application was accompanied by some 1,600 references. However, the answer was dismissed, further pointing out that the threat to him was not enough. When she was rejected by opposition and administrative litigation, she suffered depression and suicidal thoughts. After two difficult processes, namely refugee filing, protest and administrative litigation, he received refugee status last year. If the first screening had been carried out properly, I would not have missed nearly two years, Sadar said. According to the Ministry of Justice, the number of appeals and administrative litigation cases has increased 11-fold and 21-fold, respectively, over the past four years.○ Worrying being caught in a long refugee review period ' We will kill you and your son.Oksana Oksana, 40, a single mother living in St. Petersburg, Russia, was plagued by such threatening e-mails. It was written by two year olds who hate mixed blood. He had already moved to a small town in his hometown due to apartheid. In 2008, someone set fire to the house where the hat lived. The students on the road used the terms ' Negro (deprecating blacks) ' and ' Jan. ' She traveled to Finland and the U.K. and then to Korea at the end of 2014 to avoid discrimination. On the second day of the trip, the son suddenly said, "" Mom, let's live here. "" "" My son was surprised when he heard ' Pretty ' from a Korean grandmother on the subway. They called it fecal, monkey. So, I started to like Korea. "" Oksana applied for refugee status in July 2015, but the interview was not held until mid-December. After only four hours of interviews, I received a notice to "" dismiss "" next month. Although the court immediately raised an objection, the decision to approve was made only eight months later. I could not plan for the future while waiting for the results of the refugee review. It was frustrating to know when to move or when to get a job. "" The statement of ' Can't Go Back to Inter-racial Conflict ' had suddenly changed in the translation ' Can't go back due to their enemies. ' The vague statement that "" I would like to return next year if my country is stable at any time "" was interpreted with determination to say, "" I will return home next year. "" Unacknowledged as a refugee, he was finally deported from South Korea last year. Experts point out that the reason why the screening process for refugees is poor is because both manpower and expertise are vastly insufficient. The quality of the first screening is key, says lawyer Lee Chang-woo of the Center for Public Service Law, adding, `` The government should allow independent refugee referees to review the cases from the beginning and train their employees to improve their professionalism. '' Some also point out that more people should be asked to investigate information on refugees.○ In South Korea, non-refugement but non-refuger, humanitarian refugees do not get special refugee status, but there is a system called the "" humanitarian refugees "" that provides similar stay and work opportunities. Syrian civil war refugees receive this position. The problem is that they are not formally refugees and do not receive basic benefits such as health insurance. Nur, a 20-something Syrian man living in North Gyeongsang Province, wants to make some money when he thinks of his parents and siblings who move house every two months to avoid war in Aleppo, Syria. However, the presidents of companies do not give work to the temporary visa given to Indian residents. This is because they mistakenly believe that they can not get a job. "" It is really hard to find work because I am poor at both Korean and English. I don't want to be a regular refugee, but I would like some opportunities to learn Korean. "" Human rights groups insist that humanitarian immigrants specify basic benefits such as jobs and health insurance. Some say that the refugee law should be revised to solve the ambiguous status of the humanitarian immigrants. It is hard to give humanitarian immigrants undetermined benefits, said Professor Han Geon-soo of Kang-won University. We need to revise the refugee law after a social discussion.Cho Eun-ah, reporter for the magazine achim@donga.com"
"▽ Exports, semiconductor, and household income 〓 As the deterioration in employment of young people and polarization has not occurred, it is difficult to understand the GNI of $ 30,000 per capita (PG) [Manufacturing Cho Hae-in] as an illustration (Seoul). Unlike the economy, which is ranked as a disgrace, the household is still very dry. According to the Bank of Korea (BOK) on July 2, the Korean economy is forecast to approach $ 30,000 per capita GNI this year. Last year, Korea`s GNI per capita was $ 27,561. If the GNI per capita increase by 8.9 percent compared to last year, it could break the $ 30,000 barrier. The GNI rose to the mid-seventh level by the third quarter of this year, a central bank official said, It would be natural to achieve GNI of $ 30,000 per capita next year unless the exchange rate changes. By entering GNI of $ 30,000 per capita, it means that Korea has joined the ranks of advanced countries. As of October last year, the GNI of each person in 27 countries in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was more than $ 30,000 per capita. The Korean economy will soon face the $ 30,000 range in 12 years after slipping several times after entering the $ 20,000 range for the first time in 2006. It is considered a feat based on the rising exports of semiconductors. It is also significant because it is the result of the falling growth trend. However, the reaction is chilly. The economy is not doing so well. Recent developments in employment and income, closely linked to the economy, are not good, as shown by the number of employed people in October (United News Agency), up from a high of 2,855 million from the previous month. The rise in the number of employed fell to 212,000 in August after holding on to more than 300,000 for a while. In September, it seemed that the number of students went up to 314,000 again, but it dropped to 200,000. Unemployment among young people aged 15 to 29 was 8.6 percent, up 0.1 percentage point from a year earlier. It is the highest level since 1999 on a yearly basis. The employment support index for the young, a measure that shows the jobless rate as a whole, stood at 21.7 percent, up 0.6 percentage point from a year earlier. One out of five youth thinks they are unemployed. Household spending has also worsened. According to the National Statistical Office, the average real monthly income of households across the country in the third quarter (July and September) was 439,000 won, 0.2 percent less than the same period a year ago. Considering the price increase, it means that the income is down from last year. The average monthly real income of households remained negative for the seventh consecutive quarter of 2015. The increasing polarization is also why the index and the mood are different. The scale of households with more than two members in the fifth quarter of this year was 5.18 times higher than in the third quarter of last year. The income quintiles divide by the upper 20 percent average income by the lower 20 percent average income, meaning that the larger the figure, the more unequal the income was. The income quintiles, which were compared to the same period a year ago, increased in the seventh straight quarter from the first quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year (worsening income distribution). That is why the per capita GNI is set to enter the $ 30,000 level, but the cold reaction of "" It sounds like another country. "" The government is feeling a similar sense of problem. "" The growth rate is important, but the people have not felt the warmth and mistakes of growth, "" Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance Kim Dong-yeon told reporters last month. Lee Keun-tae, a senior researcher at LG Economic Research Institute, said, Exports and semiconductors have not significantly improved into household incomes. Still, we are seeing slower than other indicators, even though we don`t see improvement in employment and income, the government should watch whether or not it will produce results, he added. porque@yna.co.kr ▶ Report and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!) 2.5 earthquake measuring 2.5 degrees north to the North Korean border Hamgyeong-do = 4.31 a.m., May 2, 2008 ; North and South Korea's nuclear test started at 4.11 a.m., November 2.

"Lee Woo-hyun, a former candidate of the Free Korea Party who was nominated for nomination in the 2000 election, was dismissed as part of a nomination process for Sanu-ri, and was dismissed as a lawmaker. Lee insists that he did not receive the money that his aides brought, but gave it back the next day. Prosecutors, however, captured the context that not only did Rep. Lee not return 50 million won but also had the 500 million won during the nomination process. Prosecutors are expanding their investigation, thinking Rep. Lee received money from other contenders. According to the assessment authorities on July 1, former chairman of the Namyangju City Council in Gyeonggi Province Gong (56, and arrested) handed over a total of 550 million won to Rep. Kong ran as a reserve candidate for the Namyangju market ahead of the local elections in 2014, which was then a jury for the Saenuri Party's nomination process.Kong put 500 million won in a fruit box and delivered it to Lee by car. However, Kong complained to Lee when he failed to win the nomination, and returned 500 million won. Prosecutors believe that Lee received the money before the screening, but returned it after the results of the screening process to the National Assembly, thereby gaining recognition as a reward.Prosecutors also confirmed that Kong gave Rep. Lee 50 million won separately before and after screening for nomination. Prosecutors see the money that Kong delivered after he was excluded from the nomination as insurance for the next election. Kong ran for the Saenuri Party in the run-up to the April 13 general elections in 2016.The Seoul Central District Public Prosecutors ` Office secured statements from related suspects and witnesses, including Kong and Lee`s former aide, Kim. Kong was arrested on July 29 on suspicion of violating the Political Funds Law. Kim was arrested in October on suspicion of receiving tens of millions of won from a similar receiving company, IDS Holdings Co., to clean up its investigation. Prosecutors reportedly found clues to Lee`s acceptance of illicit funds during Kim`s investigation.Lee apologized on blogs and Facebook the day Kong was arrested, but denied allegations of nomination. `` I am sorry I failed to properly manage the illicit activities of my former aide (Kim), asking for forgiveness and will faithfully deal with the prosecutors ` investigation, '' Lee said. As to the suspicion of accepting the nomination for contributions, "" It's absolutely ridiculous. "" "" The former aide was arrested once on call and called in bribes in return, but why bother to shout at me? "" The next day, the candidate came with his wife and returned the money and gifts in her presence.Prosecutors, however, are known to have secured evidence and statements that not only did Rep. Lee receive the extra money but also did not return the 500 million won he received as a lump sum.Prosecutors are further confirming the illicit funds Lee received. On July 27, the office of vice chairman of the Bucheon City Council in Gyeonggi Province was confiscated. Prosecutors are also investigating whether some of the money Lee received might have gone to other pro-Park lawmakers or the Saenuri Party Party.< Daily News hulk@kyunghyang.com> [Twitter] ▶ [Popular free cartoons] Your Facebook page was last month when the seriously injured and wounded soldiers were saved at the seriously wounded medical center of (www.khan.co.kr), and non-redistributing and redistributional sites.

"○ Train Express from Busan to White and Brown-haired Backpacks = Arrest photo Excused…All Korean Barriers Live until dawn on Dec. 8, 2011 A victim is suspected to have been found hiding in a local bar office truck ... "" This is because they need to find a man among hundreds of passengers. All I had on him was a white shirt and a brown sideguard. He had to identify his face with a photo of identification on a resident registration card. The size of his key or size was unknown.When the train arrived, passengers poured out of the gates. A sharp detective snatched the arm of a man in a white shirt and a brown bag. Another detective hugged his other arm quickly so he wouldn't run away. Park (31), who was suspected of murder in the U.S. in 2011 and escaped from Korea, was arrested six years later.Park was living in Atlanta, southeast Georgia. It is a large city with about 100,000 Koreans living in it. Atlanta also has two Korean residents, one of whom is Dulus. It is not known when Park has lived in the United States since, but he was not a permanent resident or a citizen, according to local Koreans. Among Koreans, Park was known only as an ordinary student, but had a degree in studies to maintain her U.S. visa, rather than attending a proper school. One Korean resident remembers that Park lived quietly enough not to get involved in any drunk driving or fight against violence.The incident began around 4 a.m. on Dec. 8, 2011 at Dulus, a Korean-operated interior packaging wagon. This is the only place in Korea that runs until dawn, and was a regular home for Park, who used to work at a nearby bar. On the same day, Park also visited the carriage cart with Shin (36), her aunt (31), and Kang (26), who worked as employees. At the time, two women, a friend and an aunt (32), were drinking at a local host bar. The two groups had an argument after getting drunk, saying, I don't have any manners, but the bar owners and the women on Koh's part didn't make a big fight.By 6 a.m. when Goh and his suite had paid the bill and left the cart, the fight had reignited. All four of Park's men had been out in the parking lot outside the bar to smoke. They first cursed and laughed and exchanged fists. The fight, which had taken place for about half an hour, ended when Koh and her family got into the car.However, Park and her family tried to pull Koh out of the car, who was sitting in the passenger seat, out of the car by blocking the front and back of the car she was in. Meanwhile, a friend of Ko who was driving hit Park by pressing the accelerator and knocking him down. One of Park's angry team took Ko out of the car, stabbed her in the neck and sides several times before running away. Koh and her drinking party had left the scene in a car when the fighting intensified. Koh, who had collapsed in the parking lot with blood, was not found until 7 a.m. He was taken to the hospital but died.All of the suspects had their initial investigations into Park were shrouded in mystery. Since Dulus banned the business of bars after 1:30 a.m., witnesses were hard to find. The CCTVs in parking lots were also too far from the scene to identify suspects. Due to work at a host bar while traveling around the city every two to three months, no information about Ko was found. The only witness was a taxi driver who was about 20 meters away. Lee and Shin were captured while the taxi driver identified the faces of the physical marchers, and Kang turned himself in. But all of them said it was Park who took out the knife they owned and stabbed him, and they had no direct relationship to the murder. Park had hurried back to Korea two days after the incident.U.S. courts have once refused a bail request made by three people suspected of murder. However, the trial was suspended until the three men had been consistently declared and Park caught, releasing the three with bail of between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 each. Police also analyzed the CCTV at the large discount mart parking lot opposite to the one at the scene, and determined that Park was the one who took out the knife and stabbed it.The case was brought to Itaewon, the United States, as similar to the murder at a hamburger restaurant in Itaewon in 1997, when suspects all accused of claiming to be innocent and went home. Other than the incident, the fact that there are Korean bars operating until dawn in violation of the law and the victim's occupation as a host in the U.S. made headlines. The Korean Residents ' Association of Atlanta even launched a campaign to clean up the Korean community, saying, "" We will prevent the U.S. from losing its status. ""Six years after the case involving the owner of a phone number that has always been switched off, a U.S. court sent a request in June to the Korean Justice Ministry to detain Park. It was on September 18 when the case reached the International Crime Investigation Department. Interpol or Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency has only got information about Park : a photograph of her face, her registration number, her place of residence at the registration table, and her arrival at the airport when she entered South Korea. His first home, which police found, was on the second floor of a restaurant building. He registered as a fake address when he entered Korea.According to police polls, Park was hiding out completely six years later. The cell phone had to be replaced several times, and the mobile phone had to be replaced with another person's name before closing the account to avoid being tracked down. The company also moved frequently on a monthly basis. He had never used his resident registration number except for a few stops at an otorhinolaryngology clinic in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province in 2013. There was not even a trace of it in social media such as Facebook.Police tracked Park's older sister in Korea. Park has been out of touch with her father, so her sister was the only family she could contact in Korea. Police were in hiding for a few days at his older sister's house in Seodaemun District, Seoul, but Park did not appear. Police have secured 100,000 copies of Park's calls and analyzed them, and were able to pay attention to several numbers. Among the numbers, they found a line that shut off most of the time. During the 40-day tracking, the phone was turned on for only 10 hours. Park, who used to work at the call center of an insurance company in Jongno-gu, Seoul, lived a very closed life, traveling from home to work in Ilsan, police say.Catch a Suspect Getting Off Seoul Station The only time Park was caught was when the police turned on the cell phone 40 days after they tracked her. I turned off my cell phone and turned it on every hour. It was the day he left the company three days ago and went down from Seoul by express bus to meet his military friend who lives in Busan. She seemed to have turned on her phone to make an appointment, as if she had met her friend somewhere. Interpol or her team had no time to locate Park's cell phone in real time.He went to Busan from Gangnam Express Bus Terminal along the central inland highway and spent time in other areas such as GwangallI. Park was on the bus that day when police first identified the face of a possible suspect. Police, who expected Park to come to Seoul by express bus, moved to Seoul Station when her cell phone was located at Busan Station after waiting at the Gangnam Express Bus Terminal. I expected to take the KTX and that was right.Park is currently locked up and imprisoned in a Seoul jail. According to a U.S. local court, if Park is convicted of murder, he could face a life sentence without parole. The Justice Ministry said it will determine whether the Seoul High Court will hand over Park`s medical soldier to the United States in accordance with a extradition treaty with the United States.[reporter Kim Soo-kyung cat@chosun.com][ Direct to Dooson.com] - Compritations ilbo Chosun Ilbo & chosun.com, No reproduction or redistribution without permission"
"U.S. correspondent Kang Young-du is expected to complete the underwater launch test before the construction of the DongNam shipyard. U.S. media devoted to North Korea's issue of 38 North Korea photographed commercial satellite images of a shipyard in the North's west coast of Nampo, South Pyongan Province, three times between July 11 and 16 on July 24. North Korea estimated that the operation of the chairman of the barge was carried out at the dock, including pumps, electricity, and communication equipment. In other words, the final process of completion and deployment is under way. `` It is not clear exactly exactly exactly what kind of design he is doing and when the barge will be in operation, but it appears to be almost operational, '' said researcher Joseph Burgess. After the design work is completed, the barge can be operated to facilitate extensive SLBM testing and potentially establish SLBM capability of the West Sea fleet. The barge at the Dongnam shipyard is believed to be North Korea`s second SLBM : No. North Korea has operated SLBM barges at Shinpo since 2014. The two barges in Shinpo and Nampo are 9.5m wide and 22.5m long, and are very similar in size and arrangement to the Russian-made PSD-4 barge.38 North Korea maintains an underwater launch test for the launch of a submarine-launched ballistic missile at the naval shipyard in southern Pyeongan-do, North Korea's southeastern coast. The photo shows the North's Nampo naval shipyard photographed with satellite images in April (left) and September, and the barge is still under test for an underwater launch of a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). 2017.9.29 [Combined news = yn29 @a.co. kr. a. ▶........Support drivers ' tip and inquiry (click!) ▶ Supercritical trends in the shape of a can of safety downfallers, skeleton of a new trends (click!) [Hankyoreh cylinder How many cans did physicists at Harvard University in the U.S. crush, with a serious look on their faces in the lab? Physicals researchers at Harvard University and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne in the U.S. studied the complicated actions and conditions of the forces involved in crushing Coca-Cola cans and reported the results in a recent issue of the journal Physical Review. But it is not just about analyzing the crushing characteristics of the coke can. The researchers said the crushing experiment helped design for the stability of the cylindrical space rocket, as well as beer cans and other aluminum beverage cans with the cylindrical shell. Their experiment was to figure out which side of the can the can began to sink into the sides with a stick of metal balls, holding the can between two metal plates and pressing it with varying sizes of force. From the experiments, the researchers tried to see how the size of the axial force and the size of the dent began to affect the can. Researchers repeatedly made such achievements by crushing coke cans. The researchers identified the overall stability of a ' map of the stability of cylindrical metal cladding ' when combined with the magnitude of the axial force and the size of the depression. It is said to help them predict what combination of conditions a can is crushed or not crushed. The following is the summary of research by the online media of the American Physical Society (APS). ″ For example, cans do not get crushed when the axial load is below a certain value, no matter how big the depression is. But when you exceed that value, the can is all crushed if the puncture is sufficient. Because the abrupt distortion indicates normal behavior, known as "" nonlinear stability, "" all objects with cylindrical cans and hollow areas would have similar skin stability.″ (online media [on Physicality >) If this universality is valid, the researchers used ˝ If so, they could identify a weak space rocket or something like that as being able to react with a ' stability map ' in advance. Green of the paper (Translation) We measure the phenomenon of responses in cylindrical envelope when pressed and assess the stability coverage. It is characterized by the stability of both the complete and incomplete cladding, when it is the only dominant defect. We show that the overall distribution of stability is independent of the loading protocol or geometry of the object (e.g., a depression on the shell). Our findings suggest that the combined stability of the skin can eventually be explained as a low source. When tracking the projections and depressions from this overall distribution, natural phase-space coordinates are defined to describe skin stability.

"▽ Re-inspection of the Greate 〓 Police booked the first professor seven years ago. It is expected that the controversy over the authenticity of the book will grow as it was discovered that Professor A fabricated signatures of other professors in the process of examining the type of letter that he claimed was being raised. A, however, insists that the power to decriminalize the greater was framing me as fake.Professor A first claimed to have discovered an increaser in September 2010. Making public 12 types owned by a high-skilled tailor, he said, This is the world's first metal type made during the Goryeo Dynasty, called Jeungdogja. His argument immediately sparked a "" truth-ridden controversy. ""In 2014, Professor A argued that there was another increase in the price. He claimed that three of the seven metal types he handed over to the Museum of Fine Arts in Cheongju in late 2010 were due to the increase in prices. Professor A participated in the restoration of metal type blocks of the Joseon Dynasty from 2007 to 2010 at the Cheongju High-in-Print Museum. He purchased 260 ancient documents, metal type, and other artifacts with national budget and 7 billion won. At the time, Professor A submitted an audit that was signed and sealed by him and two others. Four years later, three of the type's claim is to be a greaser.The National Institute of Scientific Investigation concluded in October 2015 that seven of the type letters Professor A sent to the Museum of Fine Arts in Cheongju are likely to be fake. As the controversy over the price increase grew, the police conducted an investigation on the price increase for 17 months from December 2015 to May. According to police investigation results, Professor A forged signatures or seals of another professor when he handed over seven types to the Museum of Anchorments in 2010. The professors told police, I have never judged or signed seven letters.The police also investigated over 250 ancient books that Professor A bought during his research on the restoration of metal types in Joseon. The police believe that Professor A fabricated signatures of more than 10 other professors in the documents. It was also confirmed that Professor A purchased a considerable number of research books from a Daegu art and technology shop that claimed to have raised the price of the blocks. The art community suspects that Professor A raised the profits by weaving with a antique dealer and inflating the prices of cultural assets.Professor A also referred about 10,000 pieces of cultural assets to the Cheongju High-in-Print Museum in 2013, about 1000 of them stolen or stolen. Police say they confiscated nearly 10,000 pieces of the cultural assets, and hundreds of them actually found their owners. We suspect that he tried to temporarily store the gift and sell it later, said an official at the High-Print Museum.Professor A flatly denied the charges on the phone. Professor A said, "" My professors I used to know asked me to give them my feelings for type and to sign for them. "" "" Suddenly, the police don't want me to answer that, "" regarding forgery. As for the stolen and stolen assets left to the Cheongju High-in-Print Museum, I don`t know what to buy, and I don`t know how to buy them.Police booked Professor A without physical detention on charges of forgery, violations of the Cultural Properties Protection Law and the Store Cultural Properties Protection Law last May and sent him to the prosecution. Prosecutors have yet to decide whether to prosecute or report the case to the media. Experts say, "" We need to make the case public in order to find the owners of stolen cultural assets, but we have to ask whether the prosecution and the police are too passive in their support when compared to other cases of cultural assets crimes. "" After the investigation, I will file a lawsuit against those who hurt me, A said.Economic growth is improving, but the Korean economy is suffering from the soaring unemployment rate among youths due to the falling number of decent jobs.According to the Bank of Korea's provisional income for the third fiscal quarter of 2017, the real GDP in the third quarter rose 1.5 percent to 392.5157 trillion won (a seasonally adjusted unit) from the previous quarter. Growth was the highest in 29 quarters since the second quarter of 2010 (1.7 percent). Gross domestic product in the third quarter rose by 3.8 percent from the same period last year, the highest since the first quarter of 2014. The market sees the ' surprise ' growth rate.The real GNI for the third quarter was 414.4222 trillion won (based on a season-adjusted system), a 2.4 percent increase from the previous quarter. GNI refers to the nation's combined earnings from wages, interest, and dividends received at home and abroad over a certain period. The central bank forecast annual GNI would approach $ 30,000 this year.The OECD forecast for the Korean economy to grow 3 percent this year, three years after it returned to a rosy economic outlook for the world on July 28. Compared to last June's forecast, this year's growth forecast is 0.6 percent and next year's forecast is 0.2 percent. The OECD forecast that the Korean economy would grow by 3.0 percent in 2019 as well. The OECD diagnosed that the Korean economy is recovering thanks to robust semiconductor exports and growing corporate investment this year.Exports are also on a high rise. Exports amounted to $ 49.17 billion in November, up 9.6 percent from a year earlier, according to the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy. It is the highest level ever to date by November. The figure has increased for the 13th straight month since November last year. Cumulative exports from January to November also amounted to $ 524.8 billion, a 16.5 percent rise from the same period last year.Exports have turned around the Korean economy, but the Korean job market is slowing down.The employment trend at the National Statistical Office in October saw an increase in the number of employed people to 200,000 in Myeongmyeong University, and the unemployment rate among young people aged 15-29 continued to soar.The number of employed workers rose only by 279,000 (1.0 %) from a year ago to 268,500 in October, breaking the 300,000-strong mark again in a month. The number of employed people has decreased to 212,000 in August, but recovered to the 300,000 in September (314,000) a month.Unemployment among young people was 8.6 percent in October, up 0.1 percentage point from a year ago. It is the highest level in 18 years since the nation saw its youth unemployment soar in the wake of the foreign exchange crisis in October.The employment support index 3, which shows the jobless rate as a young adult, stood at 21.7 percent, up 0.6 percent from a year earlier. It is the highest level since 2015 when statistics concerned began to be aggregated. As a result, the proportion of employed young people aged 15 to 29 in October is the lowest ever.A bigger problem is that the outlook is not rosy as fewer young people prefer decent jobs. According to the National Statistical Office's ' Statistics on Job Administration 2016 ' last year, the number of jobs rose to 23.23 million, up 220,000 from the previous year. There were 36.1 million new jobs created by creating businesses or expanding businesses, and 33.6 million were lost. However, the figure decreased by 90,000 in the large conglomerates, which are considered relatively decent jobs due to their high wages, although 320,000 were increased by SMEs. "" I know the overall unemployment rate in Korea is currently low, but I know that the youth unemployment rate is rising by 10 percent, "" said Professor Anouf Singh at Georgetown University in an interview with The World Daily, "" growth is not just in the manufacturing sector, but in the private sector. The Korean government should revamp its system with education to foster talented individuals required for many future jobs, he said.Sejong : A reporter of Lee Cheon-jong skylee@segye.com ⓒ ilbo The Global Media Daily"
"- Amazon : "" Search for Expansion Opportunities in Various Markets "" - The possibility of advancing to the Korean market can not be ruled out - but the acquisition scenario with local players is mentioned as a first [Herald Business = Park Roo-moo] in the Korean market. Amazon introduced the Amazon Global Selling, which enables you to sell products abroad without the need for logistics and customer support. As Amazon, the world's No.1 e-commerce company, has launched a reverse-straight drive in Korea, observers say, the Korean market is about to enter.  There is a rumor that Amazon has launched a ` reverse ` fastball in Korea in September.Amazon Global Selling is a website that supports product registration and marketing, allowing online sellers to sell to datkeom It enables local sellers to sell products to more than 300 million customers in 185 countries around the world. Sellers can benefit from Amazon's One-Stop Order Processing Service (FBA). In addition, Amazon provides a representative of all processes that occur after a customer order, including customer enquiries, returns, or refunds.The entry into the field is putting more weight on Amazon's theories on Korea's development. Amazon operates as an open market platform that connects large numbers of buyers and retailers. It is advantageous to have a large number of sellers and buyers alike to start open market services here. The distribution industry expects Amazon to draw local sellers onto its platform in a way that will pave the way for a reverse. Once Amazon has had some seller pools, it would create a Korean site and naturally engage Korean customers who currently use the site. Another scenario of entering the Korean market is mergers and acquisitions (M&A) with local companies. Already, Amazon tried to enter the Chinese market by acquiring an e-commerce company, Joyo.com in 2004. If Amazon acquires a dominant presence in the local e-commerce market, it can more easily settle in. EBay had previously acquired Korea`s largest open market platform, including G-Market and Auction, and successfully entered the market. EBay acquired Auction and G-Market in 2001 and 2009, becoming the country`s largest e-commerce site by name. It is growing at 7 to 8 percent per year. Last year, it posted an operating profit of 863.4 billion won and 67 billion won, the only surplus among Korean e-commerce companies. Amazon is also likely to follow a similar strategy to utilize the infrastructure of Korean companies. Meanwhile, Amazon maintains its stance that it can not officially announce its plan to enter Korea yet. dodo@heraldcorp.com (Photo : Lee Seung-jin) [Asian business reporter Kim Bong-soo, Geum Bo-ryung, Lee Seung-jin] [Why are you hitting me so hard? Apologize right now! "" "" What are you doing with the little touch? You can't apologize! '' A fight took place between passengers on the subway line No. 1 in Seoul around 6:00 a.m. The argument began when two women in their 50s, wearing thick padding jumpers, collided over tight seats. The two women had a spell of scuffs about how old they were, then fell asleep when one arrived at the destination. The two of them and the passengers next door have ruined the time when they can plan their days off quietly on the morning commute. As the winter approaches, the number of "" shoulder hoodlums "" with thick padding jumpers continues to grow, followed by the summer's "" left-footed men "" and "" takami. "" Already suffering from larger sizes in the narrow seats that were introduced and designed in the 1970s, citizens wearing thick padding are engaged in fierce shoulder warfare with each other. More than 6 p.m. on November 30, half of the passengers wore heavy padding jumpers during the cold weather, when the lowest temperature dropped to - 5 degrees Celsius inside subway trains. Heavy clothing made some passengers in cramped seats look uneasy with their shoulders straight and their upper bodies bent forward. Because of the bulky volume of padding jumpers, the amount of space available for each person is narrower. According to a clothing industry official, winter clothes are actually two to three times larger than summer clothes and padding jumpers are five to six times thicker. Another reason is that the subway system first opened in 1974 had the same seat area, while Koreans had a much larger size. In 1979, Korean adult males stood at an average height of 166.1mm and hips of 90.2mm. However, 30 years later, the average height of the hips reached 172.4 cm and 94.8 cm. The distance between elbows, which has the biggest influence, was also increased to 49 cm. However, the size of seats in subway trains continues to apply this standard, with the exception of a few new vehicles, after it was only extended by 15 ㎜, from 375 ㎜ to 450 ㎜ per person. As things turned out like this, people often felt uncomfortable in subway cars. Kim Hee-young (29), an office worker I met on the subway line 2, said, I felt tired of moving my arm when someone next to me was reading a book or playing games on my cellphone. There was a situation in which the train had a seat free but nobody could sit down. Two men in padding were sitting on either side of the empty seat. On the naked eye, only half the empty seats were visible. There were about ten passengers standing near. Kim (26), a college student, said, "" Sometimes it's better to stand comfortably than to be too tight and not to go with your shoulders open. "" "" If you're sitting on a seat like that, you'd have to wear a neck. "" As his shoulders collided with the passenger next door, a male passenger sat down to ease his discomfort. Seoul Transportation Corporation, which operates subway lines one through eight, reduced the number of seats in new trains on subway lines one to one, which was introduced in July this year, and decreased the number of seats. Therefore, each seat was changed to 480 ㎜. It is an increase of 30 ㎜. Each seat on lines 1 through 8, including Line 2, is 450mm wide.Indeed, the new trains were built on that day and appeared to have wider seats, making it easier for passengers to bump into each other. "" I have never ridden in a new train today, and it feels more comfortable than usual to sit down, "" said one of the pregnant women, and as she sat down, she felt frustrated. The new trains have less of that, said Park.View of new subway line No. 2. The number of seats in the first row was reduced to 6, and the size of seats is 480 mm, 30 millimeters higher than before. But there is another problem. Due to the lack of money, it will take a long time to replace the old trains. The transportation authority is planning to bring in 200 cars by the second half of next year and 196 cars by 2020 on Line 2. By 2022, the goal is to introduce a total of 6.1 cars including 150 cars for Line 3 and 46 for Line 2. A total of 3571 cars are operating on the subway lines from 1 to 8 that day. Although the training period will be changed to an old order, more than 21 years of trains are also in the process of being 2018. As the budget has gone into astronomical waters, we need to get funding from the city and the government, an official at the transportation corporation said. Even with the introduction of new trains, citizens can not get on the trains immediately. It takes several more months to operate due to the approval process and the safety checks required. Thirty cars are still in the garage, but only ten are driven by road tests. Since safety is the top priority, it will take a little while before citizens get on the new trains themselves, said an official at the transit agency.

Chung Dong-young told reporters, If Ahn agrees with his counterparts that the elections should go as they are, he will be totally disappointed if they say they will be wiped out in the next elections.Goodday @.Report to the National University of Ewha's Pro-Japanese Project Planning Team members announced on July 13 that they were "" Anti-Japanese Activities Indicals of Kim Hwal-ran, the main building of Ewha Women's University in Seoul, "" and "" Welcome to Korea! Choi Hyun-kyu, a reporter at Ewha University, is suffering from internal confusion over the statue of the founder, Dr. Kim Hwal-ran. Schools have forcibly removed the "" Pro-Japanese Activities Notice "" sign set by students, and students are running into trouble on the campus with anti-Japanese posters condemning the school. The issue of the statue of collaborators has been repeated in universities, including Korea University and Yonsei University. Some point out that a consensus is needed on the merits of the ball. According to the project planning group, which consists of students from Ewha Womans University, a sign placed in front of Kim`s statue was pulled down in two weeks on July 13. The school asked students to voluntarily remove the signs, saying, It is a history of a statue being erected long ago and having been with Ewha campus for a long time. As the demolition itself was not carried out, the school drew its own sign on July 27. "" Intramural installations of permanent public structures need to follow established procedures and are forced to remove an installation that did not comply. "" Students of the planning group have been protesting the demolition of the school by posting giant posters all over it. Clearing the signs does not remove Kim`s pro-Japanese activities, they said, adding that they would put up a sign again. Statue of Kim Seong-su, Kim Heung-bae, and Baek Nak-jun of Yonsei University were also controversial because of their pro-Japanese activities during the past years. Students do not think it is appropriate to erect statues of such a figure at a university to commemorate it. Ewha Womans University students constantly called for the removal of the statue of Kim Hwal-ran, and protested against it and threw eggs. Korea University students also called for a balanced reassessment of the statue of Kim Seong-su in July. Experts suggested that the schools might consider accepting criticism from students to disclose both public and private lessons as an official memorial. Park Han-yong, a researcher at the Center for Korean Studies in Korean Minjok Leadership, said, In the case of Ewha Womans University, students tried to remove the statue at first, but rejected it because the school rejected it and correctly set up a sign saying, "" It's another true story. "" The school still looks perplexed. The single line of explanation, "" First President, Dr. Kim Hwal-ran, "" should allow each of us to reflect on the statue, "" the university said. I don`t think we will go ahead with writing down the mistakes together because the statue was built to honor the philosophy of SNU, said an official.Written = Im Ju-eon, journalist Lee Hyung-min, eon@kmib.co.kr,"

The figure was 437.1 billion won (5.4 percent) higher than last year`s third quarter (8.17 trillion won). As of the third quarter, when the holiday season is at its highest, spending on overseas consumption usually decreased to 6.17 trillion won in 2014, but has since grown for the third straight year. As the total spending during the third quarter of this year is cumulative, spending on overseas consumption is also record 23.67 trillion won. Compared to last year's amount of 21.89 trillion won, the figure rose by 1.739 trillion won (8.2 percent).Jeong Ha-jong (Yeongjong-do = Yonhap News Agency), a reporter of the Korea International Airport, said, "" People leave from Incheon Airport on the morning of July 8, when the number of Koreans who have left Korea this year has nearly doubled. 2017.10.8 chc@yna.co.kr also reported a record amount of credit, debit card overseas use in the third fiscal quarter of this year was $ 4.83 billion.

Meanwhile, foreigners spent 3.31 trillion won in Korea in the third quarter, a 13.4 percent decline from the same period last year. This is the result of the sharp decline in Chinese tourists due to the "" THAAD "" conflict.
