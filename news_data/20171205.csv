Rewhell, Finland's global business consulting firm, analyzed the rate plans of 187 mobile operators (58 resellers) and 41 countries in OECD and the European Union (EU). ▽ Pictures by mobile phone retailer in downtown Seoul on 5th. International Consulting Company analyzed report on hama@yna.co.kr[Yonhap news agency], (Seoul = Yonhap news agency) ; Choi Byung-kook : Korea's smartphone data rates are the most expensive among major countries in the world. Rewhell, Finland's global business consulting firm, analyzed the rate plans of 187 mobile operators (58 resellers) and 41 countries in OECD and the European Union (EU). Rewhell published the latest edition of the Digital Fourier Monitor (DFM) on July 1 (local time), investigating data rates and trends in the pricing of the telecommunications sector. Lithels has largely converted the price of data into two : a smartphone plan (SP) that provides at least one thousand minutes of free phone calls per month (mobile broadband MB only), and a fee scheme (November only). As a result, per gigabyte of 4G LTE data, or GB, cost 13.4 euros (about 17,000 ~ 300 won) per gigabyte of data was the most expensive system among 41 countries. Canada ranked second with 12.1 euros ; the U.S. with 9.6 euros (sixth) ; Japan with 5.7 euros (10th) ; and Germany with 5 euros (13th). Finland, on the other hand, was the cheapest at 0.3 euros (380 won), while the EU average was 2.4 euros and the OECD average was 3.3 euros (3.3 dollars). Korea is about 45 times more expensive than Finland. The price comparison per gigabyte of 4G LTE data is the most expensive among 41 countries (unit price, smartphone rate system) in Korea (leftmost), and Finland (right-most) is the cheapest. SP is charged for at least 1,000 minutes of free domestic phone calls. A price of € 38 per second LTE data use € 30 per rewheel DFM report], with the exception of unlimited slow-down services. It is the most expensive except for Malta. Eleven countries, including France and Denmark, were unlimited, and four countries, including Britain, were at least 100GB. Overall, 27 countries offered more than 10 GB for 30 euros. The amount of 4G data available for purchase in € 30 per unit (GB, 4 from left) is ranked in Korea, and eight countries including Finland, Lithuania, France, and Denmark (right) are unlimited. $ / GB of data in Korea's most expensive mobile phone (the most expensive of the world's major juyoB-only data rates were not unlimited, except for services slower than a certain amount.) Canada was the smallest with 2.3 gigabytes. The quota reached 11 countries, including Poland, Switzerland and Finland.Among the 41 countries with the lowest amount of 4G data available for 30Europes (GB per unit, special data (MB) charge), Canada was the smallest with 2GB (leftmost), and France ranked 33rd with 22GB. Service that speed would decrease if used over a certain amount was excluded from an unlimited number of services and was quoted at a cost of at least 3 Mbps of HD-class video (the most expensive of all time), [Rewheel's DFM Report in Finland] MB of highest price. The U.S. ranked third with 6.8 euros, Germany with 3.8 euros, and Japan with 3.3 euros. The OECD average was 1.2 euros ; the EU average was 1 euro. Canada (9.7 euros) on the far left, priced per gigabyte of 4G data (unit price, MB), and Finland (0.08 euros) on the far right. Among the top 10 mobile phone service providers in Korea, the most expensive rates were converted to the top 10 (Lighel's DFM Report) [among the top 10 mobile phone service providers], with the highest price of more than 3Gbps of HD video and 3Gbps of all services excluding unlimited speed. Citing Korea, Canada, the United States and Japan, the report pointed out that mobile operators in those countries over-price their data.Korea's three largest LTE data services providers, SKT, LGU +, and KT, are all included in the top 10 most expensive companies among 41 countries. Data pricing under the smartphone fee-based pricing of at least 1000 minutes free domestic call-based, while slow-down services (including slow-down service from unlimited) will always yield rates of > 3 Mbps in HD video, compared to the cost limit of [for Europe] Lightell explained that therefore, it is increasingly not possible to price discriminate by data usage. Righter said in the report that data prices in the second half of the year have been on the rise, with data costs falling by an average of 30 percent from the first half of this year. In the annual per capita mobile data usage (2016 basis) analyzed by Litheler, Korea ranked seventh with 4.0GB. Finland was overwhelming at 16.2GB ; Latvia (64GB) ; Austria (5.5GB) ; Denmark (5.2GB) ; Sweden (5.2GB) ; Poland (5.2GB) ; and Japan (5.2GB) (2.2GB). Righter Homepage ◇ How did you compare and analyze? = The report of the rewheeler is quite different from other international comparison results of communication charges known in Korea. Mobile phone service providers have a great deal of communication (voice and video), text and data at home and abroad, and are charged with various and complicated rates. The Korea Communications Price Index Development Council, which was created by the Korea Communications Commission and Korean companies, has announced that mobile communications fees in Korea are considerably lower than those of other major countries. Of course, it is because it is evaluated comprehensively with voice, SMS, and wireless Internet, compares with 3G mobile communication, and reflects the exchange rate of some OECD countries (PPP) based on exchange rate comparison. The DFM report from the International Consulting Company Lithal, which specializes in mobile data strategy, pricing, and network economics, focuses on data. That is, it analyzes the price and data limit of 4G wireless Internet access among mobile communication charges.() The mobile communication fee system (as of November 2017) for all available companies in the leading 41 countries of IT was collected on their homepages. Now, the price of the general fourth generation (4G LTE) data is divided by the so-called smart phone rate system (SP), which provides at least 1,000 minutes of free talk in Korea, and the two groups using only data are charged in MB. Prices were compared with median values within the country or per company. The value per GB of data was calculated by dividing the monthly flat rate by the amount of data allowed free. Products that always maintain HD video at a speed of 3 Mbps or higher, and those that do not have a certain amount of speed were excluded from the list of products that did not have any limits.() Despite the differences in comparison, the Rihill report shows that Korea is a very expensive country, at least for mobile data prices. In particular, the report suggests that data now account for a greater and more vital share of mobile broadband Internet usage than telephone calls or text messages, and that an unrestricted data delivery trend is on the rise. choibg@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"

Choi was put on trial on March 30 last year when he asked his aunt (48), who was not an election clerk, to campaign online for two million won during the campaign. Prosecutors said they posted their campaign pledges and promotional materials on social networking services from March 31, 2006 to April 12, right before the general elections.

"[Donga Ilbo] [Incheon Fishball Survivors : 160 Minutes a day.] We lost oxygen. "" Another one left over from the pier around 8:00 a.m. on July 3. As time went by, air pocket oxygen decreased. We could live, ' she said. They were the only three to survive being held in a boat. Lee told The Dong-A Ilbo on July 4, "" It makes me sick to go to a closed room or to a dark place, "" during a desperate fight to survive. After being rescued, the men were taken to different hospitals and were unable to muster up the courage to contact each other.Lee and her friends, who we learned about in society, often went fishing. Lee said, I was a member of the fishing expedition. We took out new equipment as usual. At 6 a.m. The Lee and his team climbed to the pier. The cabin next to the captain's room was already packed with other passengers. Headed for another cabin on the floor of the hull. The captain's room stepped down the steps less than one meter wide. Fish spear used to hold fish. It is used by fishermen. At 6:05 a.m. They were thrown to the wall with a ' bang ' sound. The boat upset and crashed into the cabin wall and floor. Lee said, "" My head and shoulders collided a lot. I am surprised I did not pass out. At 6:07 a.m. the boat was knocked over completely. The sea was soon up to the collar. It was like an ice rink. He raised his face to the ceiling. I could not even see my friend's face. Friend the Member for Simho (31) pulled out his cell phone and pushed the button, hoping it would be "" a surprise. "" The light is on. 112, 119, 122 ... I dialed all of the numbers that I remembered. Outside the cabin, I heard a cry of "" Help! "" Three passengers on deck shouted for help to the crew of the tanker which crashed into the fishing boat. Lee and his family also pounded the walls and ceiling with their fists. "" Please save me. There's someone here too. "" The water is getting cold. When no help came, he tried to escape. The only way out was to the captain's room. The only one who could swim was Sim, who would dive and try opening the door. But it was impossible to find a door under these feet, under the stairs, on a ship turned over in the pitch dark. It was so dark that I could not even tell which direction to turn, Lee said. We decided to give up the escape and wait to be rescued. As time went by, the fear of "" being unable to be saved "" increased. I called the Coast Guard again 50 minutes after the accident. But the phone went dead. Mr Shim said, "" It was my only hope ... but I was desperate. I never gave up and pressed the call button 60 or 70 times. I managed to reach 119 in 40 minutes. They talked to rescue workers for more than an hour because they thought they might never get back on the phone if they were disconnected. But I felt less oxygen in my air pocket. He was thrifty in talking. Lee said, I was breathing a little slowly. At one breath, the oxygen seemed to diminish. The life jacket I wore to live seemed to tighten my body further and I took it off. As the water reached the tip of their nose, they stepped on a shelf fixed to the wall. I thought, If this happens, I will die. We were out of breath and did not talk to each other. Cell phones were a hope for them. However, the battery decreased as fast as the oxygen it decreased. She turned off the lights that she turned on in the dark. I was thinking only of my family at home. I wanted to call. I wanted to talk to my wife, but I don`t know if my cell phone would be able to go out. My friends must have felt the same way. After 8 a.m., my friend, Chung, 32, shouted, "" The water is dripping. "" A battery bar lit up the cell phone with one remaining bar. An invisible drowning item was revealed. About half an hour later, I heard a "" Hello? "" sound from the captain's door. ‘ There are people, here they are, ’ they cried. A Coast Guard diver showed up at the door to water them with an oxygen respirator. Starting with Lee at 8:35, Jeong and Shim were rescued one by one. It was 8:48. Maritime police visited the houses around the same time. The Coast Guard asked Lee's wife, sticking out her baggage list for the No. 1 pier. "" Are you Mr. ○○ ’ s guardian? "" "" Yes, "" the Coast Guard said, announcing the accident and "" We are searching. "" Lee said, As the accident happened at dawn, my wife had not heard anything. We were shocked to hear that they were searching, not rescue. Jeong received psychological treatment due to the shock of the accident. Lee complained of a similar trauma. You can't be alone in a dark, close-enclosed space redolent of an upside-down cabin. `` It's even worse to think about the people who were in another cabin and who ended up dead. I survived but I was unable to free myself from the memory of an accident. It is really hard.Sin-ri : reporter Kim Dan-bi kubee08@donga.com A performing man suddenly cursed Lee. Lee and the man were strangers. When Lee is embarrassed, the man laughs and says, I am sorry. There is a tick that says "" × × .. "" Lee said, He made absurd excuses. He looked like he was mocking me. It was very unpleasant, but I just left because the people around me were laughing and talking. Busking was frequently held on the streets of Hongik University, Sinchon, and Daehangno in Seoul, and has become the "" culture of the streets. "" However, there are also a series of "" civil abuses "" and sexual harassment cases.On July 12, a performing man shook a woman by the hair in front of Hongik University's entrance station. The woman was waving her hands as she refused, but the man paid no attention to pulling the woman to the center of the stage and constantly shaking her hair. The figure was widely known through social networking services, sparking controversy. Lee (19. & 20), who experienced a similar situation in the same place this June, said, We don`t tolerate dizziness because we have anemia. "" But suddenly, without asking my doctor (male), I grabbed my hair, "" he said. `` I stumbled because I couldn't regain consciousness, and finally I crashed into the speaker next door. '' Other bossing reports say verbal abuse and sexual harassment were committed. At 7 p.m. on July 1, four or five performance teams were performing at the street where they wanted to walk. As one group began to dance, about 100 people suddenly gathered around and surrounded themselves. The passage has been narrowed down. Lee Jin-seong (28), an office worker living in Mapo-gu, Seoul, said, "" I always walk down this street on my way home, and many people are trampled on my foot or get hit. "" The merchants nearby are unhappy with the noise, trash, etc. The store clerk nearby complained, "" It's too noisy to open, "" and Chae Mo (62, female) who owns a karaoke booth, has already complained to the district office about the noise and no effect in July or August. As the age of the performing team falls, there are also a considerable number of teenagers who smoke in front of the store, said Lee (56), who runs the restaurant. According to Seoul City yesterday, there were 77 reports of complaints concerning Busking since 2013.

"Free Train on the Subway The Elderly Becomes a Footage in Seoul 4 Years Old Subway, Get a Silver Courtyard, and Get a Job. Ko Young-kwon, a reporter, said, "" Older people don't even pay, but younger people should sit down. "" Kim Ok-soon (70) who lives in Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul doesn't sit down when he takes the subway. He uses a senior pass (senior citizens ' transportation card) for free because he or she feels like riding off on a paying person. Kim said, I feel sorry for myself when I see the news that free transportation is increasing in the red because of the elderly who use the subway for free, since I have no driver's license, no car, and no road vision. When only 3.9 percent of the elderly (65 years old or older) were given preferential treatment in the subway when they were adopted in 1980, free rides for senior citizens were put on the road, which led to a huge increase in the number of elderly people (14.0 % this year). Older adults are frustrated by the ridicule of ' 士 空 居 gong ., ' or free subway riders, and some young people should "" raise their voices even when they are working. "" Local governments and the government are increasingly arguing over how to protect the deficit by free riding for the elderly. As the metropolitan subway has become more diverse, subway travel has become popular with the elderly. Sohn (72, Chungnam), who travels to and from Seoul by subway two or three times a week, said, "" I prefer to take the subway to my peers and the elderly to feel more relaxed by meeting their peers at home. "" There are also jobs for the elderly utilizing system benefits. Shin (67), who works as a silver courier for a delivery company in Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, found a job here in his mid-sixties as a gas station employee and district parking manager. The subway carries the goods to the busy areas of the office, such as Yeongdeungpo, Sadang and Songpa, and to the busy areas of Yeongdeungpo, Seoul, where they are delivered via the subway two to four deliveries per day. Shin said, "" The courier service was a good workout and the company's group of friends made me feel like a candy store. If I went to work, I wouldn't be lonely. "" "" Even a subway courier service would pay for free, "" and added, "" I wouldn't worry about paying for it. However, as the free use of elderly citizens increases, the voices of young people complaining about inconveniences are getting stronger. Park Sun-mi (32), an office worker, said, Sometimes when I ride subway line 1 from Anyang to Seoul, I find many elderly people who don't have enough rest on their seats, I feel pregnant. Yoon (37), a office worker who usually takes the subway line, said, I felt obligated to pay the elderly free fees every day, and I couldn't help but like the use of the new line. The trade-related tax breaks for free ride by the state-run Korea Urban Railroad soared to 544.3 billion won last year from 423.9 billion won in 2012. Last year, 16.8 percent of all subway passengers (424 million) were free, and more than a quarter of all subway passengers were "" free, "" as were Gwangju (31.6 percent) and Busan (26.4 percent). Sixty-six percent of the loss to operations at the state-run Korea Urban Railroad (excluding Korail) was free. If this continues, the loss will inevitably snowball. Given the aging trend, the amount of free losses is estimated at 788.1 billion won in 2020. Local governments insist that the government must pay to keep the system as it is a government policy based on the Free Riding Boy Act, Article 26. Seoul City officials said, It is not only about equity with Korail, but also because of the growing burden from free transportation, it is difficult to invest in aging facilities and safety. Korail's national railway system is free for the elderly, but the government will cover more than half of the losses. Rep. Hwang Hee-hee of the fishermen's Democratic Labor Party proposed a revision to the Urban Railroad Law last September to cover the losses stemming from free transportation by senior citizens, but the National Assembly's traffic committee passed a bill that is currently pending and passed it. The subway fare paid by all Koreans in metropolitan areas such as Seoul and Busan is not in proportion to their equity, according to the report. The Strategy and Finance Ministry also raised an objection on the same grounds. If the law is revised, the average amount of 800 billion won per year will become a burden on the government. However, some say that reducing the free demand of the elderly is not enough to solve the chronic deficit of subway trains. Korea Railroad Research Institute President Choi Jin-seok said, The main culprit behind the deficit is construction companies maintaining, improving, and paying a substantial amount of money to repair and improve facilities when the urban railways are public property. They say that the use of free products is mostly made by the elderly, and that the conversion to the payment system would significantly reduce the demand for the services and would not help improve earnings.

"- One person's voice limiting media content, such as African TV and YouTube, should make a structure that requires regulations but lacks provocative content profits. - Helpful content discovery and promotion efforts are just as popular as media content popularity./ Discountesy of people with Pixar Bay, murder threats with various disgust, top sexual harassment, name-calling, swearing, earthquake, and a host who wants more balloons. The popularity of one-man broadcasting is growing stronger. As African TV, YouTube, and popcorn TV platforms are inundated with provocative content, consumers are also becoming tired of their drives, prompting the government to demand that media be controlled by one person. However, experts point out that the government regulations are not effective because of the nature of one-man broadcasting, in which one can broadcast under sanctions when an account is created. ■ Government regulations. The single-member broadcasting market now has grounds to punish illegal acts, such as pornography, insults to the general public, sexual harassment and violations of the right of superficiality. Last month, the Daegu Northern Police Station booked 28 female hosts on charges of sexually broadcasting via the Internet without physical detention. A procurator who showed women in swimsuits on live TV without consent at Haeundae Beach in Busan in August was charged with violating a law on the use of cameras. However, it is realistically impossible to restrict all harmful content with the law. This is because there are many provocative but not illegal contents. Some users say, "" The Korea Communications Standards Commission (KCC) needs to be aggressive. "" A office worker in his thirties said the commission should draw up guidelines and take strong responsibility if the operators violate the rules, they said. We need to have aggressive regulations for teenagers and children, who are also state residents, the office worker in his 20s said. Currently, ‘ Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Information Protection ’ is applied to One-Internet broadcasting services. The Korea Communications Commission and the National Security Council supervise the policies, but only recommend them when they are reported. The National Assembly is preparing a bill to tighten the level of regulations, but it is not clear when it will be proposed or decided. Some say that regulations via the commission are ineffective. I wonder how much the committee members understand the nature of the one-person broadcast, said C, a man in his 20s who is preparing for the YouTube Company. Although immediate regulation is important, experts point out that guidelines should be fully understood by the committee about the nature of media contents and the nature of platforms that are different from those of previous broadcasting. CJ E&M ; Diabilisation and Stabilization manager said, I think the effects will be slight. The development of one-man media industry is the spread of freedom of expression and diversity, and it is hard to come up with a general law to regulate it, said the official. Seven domestic and international companies including the Communications Commission, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the National Police Agency, the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, Naver, Kakao, Africa TV, Google (YouTube) and Facebook have launched an official Internet conference on July 6. It is a large organization that encompasses government ministries, businesses and civic groups. It is necessary to see how the new government-led regulations will work. If the user recounts the account even after the account is suspended for a long time, it will be hard to avoid criticism that large platform operators such as Africa TV and YouTube helped protect harmful content. Especially, the sensativeness and face-off of African TV which introduced the star balloon in November 2007 is not what happened today. The same is true of similar platforms derived from African TV. The platform is a face-off content, while the stopper made money by carrying on his back a growing platform. The higher the number of queries, the better the maker and the platform will make money. Within this revenue structure, face-saving contents have been justified. That's why it can only be called "" black symbiosis. "" Each platform has its own monitoring staff, and has taken its own actions, such as permanently shutting down the controversial channel. African TV has increased the number of monitoring personnel for 24 hours a day, and Naver TV is also rapidly deleting the contents in question to stop the spread of the video. However, it seems late. Moyutuber, who is having a problem with his or her poor performance, is operating with a new channel open after the account is suspended permanently. It is already the 13th account. Other makers build nests across platforms. It is hard to avoid criticism that the platform operators lack the sense of duty and effort. A high school student who claims to broadcast a personal call for a permanent stop said, "" It would be better if we set up another account, "" adding, "" Viewers were so concerned about whether the video was displayed disappointingly. "" YouTube has several guidelines, including "" sexual content, "" "" harmful content, "" and "" violent content. ""/ Cho Jae-hyung : Rather than harmful content, beneficial contents should be better served by establishing a system to regulate the way that "" black symbiosis "" is stopped and to regulate inferior contents that can be built around large platform operators based on their freedom of expression. Officials agree, ' We need to change the structure of our profits. ' "" We need to pay attention to the recent changes in YouTube policies, "" said one YouTube chriater, "" who picked out provocative changes in titles, content, tags, thumbnails and other high-return ones. "" `` We have an advertising policy that prevents content that violates guidelines from generating revenue. We are canceling not only the user account that repeatedly violates the guidelines, but also when we find that the same user has created a new account, he said. It's time to stop the Black Symbiosis. Artists should be identified and promoted to create beneficial content and to weaken the revenue structure of provocative harmful content. The platform should provide clear guidance by disclosing internal policies and actively repressing harmful content to discourage provocative content creators, the dia-television executive advised. We need to create an environment that would give incentives to creators of useful content, he added. ocmcho@fnnews.com journalist Cho Jae-hyung : "" fnpas, "" the story of every goal in the world.Foreign news agencies such as Britain's Daily Telegraph reported late last month of a year on a man who has turned into a stout-heavy firefighter.

After the diet program, she continued to work hard and stay in shape, making her body stronger than it was ten years ago.As a result, Rouen, who now works as a firefighter in New South Wales, also had the opportunity to take a photo of a calendar photo made by a fire department.However, despite his great body, he also hates to take off his shirt at the beach because of the anxiety of his childhood when he was still fat.""

The world's 14th largest diamond is called the Peace Diamond. As the nickname suggests, half of the proceeds from the sale will be used to improve the infrastructure of the small town where diamonds were found. The Cieraion government said it would use the proceeds to finance the village's capital and electricity supply, road maintenance, health and medical support, and school and building repairs. The diamond was discovered in March by local minister Emanuel Momo and donated it to the government. `` The town lacks everything, '' he said, adding, `` Selling diamonds to middlemen won't improve the community. '' The diamond was previously sold at the Primatown auction in the capital for $ 7.8 million (about 8.4 billion won), but the Sierra Leone government refused to sell it because of its low price. Sierra Leone, which accounts for a quarter of the world`s diamond production, was once branded as a "" blood diamond "" after a fierce civil war involving foreign investors in smuggling diamonds. gogogo@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"▽ The presence of compromise = Whether to participate in the GNP is not satisfactory? 〓 The ruling on whether to participate in the vote or not was made today was made by the National Assembly during the National Assembly's revision of the constitution and the election system of next year, except for Kim Dong-cheol and Jung Woo-taek. Moon Jae-in surrounding the administration's first budget and per share fishermen deobul free Uidang-myeon, the third largest party is biggest issue of Korea is of a parallel civil servants scale and more.(job stability fund) a minimum wage hike to the actual results to come up with a compromise. It was a negotiation that highlighted the presence of the third largest political party in the ruling and opposition camp. The floor leaders of the ruling and opposition parties announced yesterday that the increase in the number of civil servants was 9475. The main opposition Democratic Party proposed an increase of 12,000 to the number of lawmakers, but proposed 1,500 to the ruling camp as the Maginot Line in response to strong opposition protests during negotiations on July 2. Moon Jae-in is more a public servant government's commitment. Park Kyung-min, a journalist at the Korea Party of Science and Technology, criticized, "" The Democratic Party refuses to compromise because it is so obsessed with the 10,000 people who are aware of Cheong Wa Dae. "" Kim Dong-cheol, floor leader of the People's Party Party, raised 8875 people. The final round of negotiations between the three parties ' floor leaders was finally set at 9475. It seemed as if they shared the proposals of the Democratic Party and the People's Party, but they were closer to the proposals of the People's Party than the Democratic Party. The minimum wage hikes on the budget for job security also helped Kim Dong-cheol's proposal for an explanation of the conditions of the extra needed to be resolved. Between the DP and the Korea Party, which says we can not afford to pay taxpayers ` money for businesses, the National Party has adopted a measure to provide more direct aid to businesses by 2018 by reducing the amount of tax benefits they would offer. Eventually, the government directly supports the fund after 2019 meaning that it will not exceed 2.97 trillion won, and the government will report plans to the National Assembly to provide tax benefits and other support. It is like the idea of the people's party was adopted. It is the result that the parties presented alternatives as the leading parties and led to a big compromise, said National Party spokesman Kim Kyung-jin. To make an agreement, the Democratic Party openly implemented a "" Green One-Dong "" strategy that focused on the people's party. Woo Won-sik, floor leader of the Democratic Party, raised the tension with the party by having a breakfast alone with floor leader Kim Dong-cheol, excluding floor leader of the party, Jeong Woo-taek. Right after breakfast, we agreed during the meeting that a constitutional amendment would have to be made as well as reform of the electoral system next year, Kim said. The people's party strongly believes that the current small and medium electoral districts should be changed to remain in the third party elections. The main opposition Democratic Party earlier gave gifts to the ruling party, agreeing to make a larger budget deployment, called via the Honam Express Railway, Muan Airport. Because of this, the budget war was fought by the Korea Party, but the party's national party took care of it. The main opposition Democratic Party is also set to take care of the people's party with the bills and amendments in mind, a National Assembly official said. We regret to have made a concession on the key issue, but we failed to make it, said a first-term DP lawmaker who declined to be named. The Korea Party, however, left a detonator. Regarding the increase in government employees and the rate of corporate taxes, the Korea Party has included the phrase Hold as a clue. The GNP lawmakers ` meeting immediately after the agreement was announced was also met with a backlash from them. Even in a meeting between the secretaries of the three main parties, Rep. Kim Do-eup, secretary general of the main opposition Grand National Party, said, It is also a big problem to have job security funds, saying, We can`t agree on committing crimes in future generations. The Korea Party will hold its general meeting again on July 5 to discuss whether or not it will participate in the voting. However, if the GNP (116 seats) disagrees or misses, the Democratic Party (121 seats) and the National Assembly (40 seats) join forces to pass the budget bill when voting in the National Assembly.

Unlike normal rainbows that float for a while and disappear, the rainbow that appears this time did not disappear for as long as nine hours.According to a local meteorologist, the record is three hours longer than the 6 hours recorded in Sheffield, England in 1994 as the world's longest living rainbow.The first time a rainbow that never disappears was on the ground was on the 27th. The rainbows that did not disappear from the sky for 6 hours at the time were in the same place again 3 hours later and they were in the same place for 3 more hours.We were surprised to see the rainbow for more than six hours, said a weather scientist at Taiwan's China Culture University. `` It would be a gift from heaven, '' he said.The expert also revealed videos of his own. At 6:57 a.m., a rainbow floating on China's University of Culture campus disappeared from view only at 3:55 p.m., exactly 8 hours and 58 minutes later.Experts analyzed that unlike regular rainbows that float for a while and disappear, the winter monsoon allowed the rainbow to be observed for as long as nine hours.It is part of a rainy season in Taiwan during this time, when it is said that the moist air in the air produces clouds and rain, and as the rain clouds continue to move, the world's longest recorded weather data shows us that the rainbow is constantly possible./ Photo : "" Nurse, bamboo forest, "" an annual event held on Facebook page, was held by the Hallim University Medical Center, which is suspected of having encouraged nurses to perform a suggestive dance. However, the reform package is receiving criticism as it contains the labor law's due diligence, such as commuting on time and vacation time. The Korea University Medical Center announced on July 4 an e-mail of its reorganization of five hospitals under the Medical Center in Seoul, Gangnam, Chuncheon, Dongtan and Han River, which boasted of the reform measures. As the allegations that the nurses at Seongsim Hospital were forced to dance in provocative clothing were raised at an athletic event on July 10, the controversy erupted and the hospital explained that it was not forced to. In addition, the video conference, in which nurses allegedly had to suffer from exploitation and overwork after preparing for two to three months, has been scrapped. In addition, it also provides improvement of working conditions, such as performing a quick fill, filling, commuting, and guaranteeing automatic annual vacation use, to maintain proper workforce at each source. In addition, it stated that it would improve irrational practices such as prohibition of business instructions outside of the work hours and mobilization of meetings and events by using violent language, assault and sexual harassment, and harsher punishment by actors. Lee Hye-ran, director of the University of Hanlim's medical department, said with sincere apologies for causing great anxiety to faculty members for criticizing the medical center and raising distrust in the organization. However, controversy is growing over what the Korean University Medical Center has proposed as reform measures, as most labor laws require that they be followed. Office worker Jeong Young-ho (33) said, "" The regular work hours and annual vacation should be observed, but it is more ridiculous to suggest a great solution. "" A 30-year-old office worker also said, I can see how poor the nurses have been in working conditions since the improvement measures at Seongsim Hospital were implemented.

Incheon, Incheon, and Yeongheungdo were found dead on two boats in the sea near Yeongheungdo Island on July 5.According to Incheon Maritime Police, the body of a first-way fisherman who boarded the first dock at 12:05 p.m. was found on the south coast of Yeongheung Island.Lee`s body was found in an ocean that was 2.6 kilometers southwest of the accident site, and wore a red jacket and a black bottoms when it was discovered.Upon hearing of the body's discovery, Lee's wife visually identified her at 12:29 p.m. Lee`s body will be placed in the Incheon Serim Hospital. At 9:37 a.m. the body of Oh (70), captain of the first pier was found on the mudflat of Yongheung-do's Yongdam beach.As a result, the number of deaths from the accident has increased to 15.▽ New Sis=Poon Hyun-Choon, Incheon Metropolitan Police Station (Incheon) = Maritime Police and other concerned parties screen fishing boats ' docks at Incheon Sea Police Station Monday. The first pier collided with a tanker near Yeongheung Bridge in the morning of the day before and was overturned. Thirteen out of the 22 crew members died and two were missing in the accident. The first dock at photo@newsis.com was overturned at 6:09 a.m. on July 3 when it collided with Myeongjin 15, a tanker called Myeongjin, one mile from the southwest of Yeongheung Island. At the time, 22 fishermen including 20 fishermen and two crew members were on board the pier. hsh3355@newsis.com> A farmer has found up to 700 million won of gallstones in the slaughter of a sow.Foreign media in Britain and Metro reported on a man who received a large gift from his pet for eight years.Mr. Bochunlou, 51, who lives in San Diego, China, found a lump in a gallbladder while slaughtering a 250-kilogram pig in August.And he didn't really know what this big rock was, which was 10 centimeters long and 7 centimeters wide, so he decided to throw it away.But the neighbor who found out about this said, "" The lump was a gallstone, "" a super-effective piece of rock, and it was very rarely found in fur or in any non-digested animal.In particular, this cholelithiasis is regarded as a "" treasure of pigs "" by traditional Chinese medicine and has been known to help remove toxins from the body.▲ The photo above is not directly related to the article.At first, he was suspicious, but he ended up visiting Shanghai, a major city, to try to impress an expert.Experts say Bo's market price of pig gallstones is up to 4 million yuan, or about 660 million won in Korean money.In addition, gallstones are only recognized when found in gallbladder, explaining that bottle of barley is valuable because it meets these conditions.After receiving an official certificate of approval from an expert, Bo said he was delighted to announce, "" We plan to sell the pig's treasures from at least one million yuan (about 160 million won).

Maritime police, whose organization was revived in July after the Sewol accident, are pointing out that the disaster is still far from happening. The reason is that the oil tanker's failure to respond to the accident on a fishing boat off Yeongheung Island in Incheon was clearly revealed. The Korea Coast Guard said Monday that the high-speed boat that was ordered to leave did not arrive until 37 minutes after the accident. But the rescue team was not really needed. We had to wait for the Incheon rescue team responsible for the disaster. The Coast Guard's Incheon rescue team arrived on the scene about an hour and 20 minutes after the request. Maritime police said they told the Coast Guard and Incheon Rescue Force to mobilize available forces at 6:13 a.m. shortly after the accident, according to the officials. The navy and fire fighters also asked for help. According to the rules out receiving the report, high-speed boat to the scene using a rescue team, Incheon, Korea should be moved. However, there was no boat to go to Incheon rescue team. Both of the rescue teams ' fast boats were not ready to move. The new boat, equipped with radar, could navigate even at night, and was being repaired due to malfunction. The other was an old type who could not get out at night because of lack of radar. The accident happened just before sunrise, when a new boat was about to go out in the rain. In the end, he had no ship to ride when he heard of the accident. Typically, rescue teams can get to the scene in about an hour when they ride on a high-speed boat and drive at a speed of 15-20 knots. The Incheon rescue team had to run 52 kilometers to Yeongheung Police Box near the area. After arriving at Yeongheung Police Box, he took a private fishing boat and set out from the dock because there were no Coast Guard vessels. The arrival time in the affected areas was one hour and 23 minutes after the dispatch. It was about 20 minutes later than when I went by express boat. Members of the National Guard and National Guard are conducting a shipboard examination on Seongseong No. 1 at a pier near Incheon Coast Guard building on July 4. Oh Jong-taek : They rescued three survivors from an air pocket more than seven minutes after arrival. Eleven out of 14 people on board were reportedly killed in the ship after they lost consciousness. If Incheon rescue teams checked the equipment in advance and quickly moved there, they could have reduced their sacrifice even slightly. A Coast Guard official said, We could not explain to Incheon rescue team because the new boat had its own engine oil color discolored on July 24, and the engine was placed in the facility on July 1. The first high-speed finish to arrive at the scene was also problematic. The high-speed boat had no night navigation, so it took 16 minutes to get there. As special agents were not on board, they roamed around for over an hour until Incheon rescue team arrived. The Pyeongtaek rescue team arrived 19 minutes earlier than Incheon rescue team, but the Incheon rescue team rescued three people from the air pocket. Another controversial fact is that the Coast Guard tried to conceal its tardy response to the accident. The accident, which was first made public by the Korea Coast Guard at 6:09 a.m., was confirmed to have occurred during 6:05 p.m. Incheon Coast Guard Chief Hwang Joon-hyun told VTS, "" At around 6:30 p.m., the two were crashed due to the rescue. "" Still, Hwang stressed that it was just 6:09 a.m. when the report was officially received. When the problem occurred, the Coast Guard announced that it would report the first time from 6:09 p.m. to 6:05 p.m. on July 4 at its 4th briefing. The order to move to the Yeongheung Police Box, which was reportedly made at 6:13 a.m., was also confirmed at 6:06 a.m., seven minutes earlier than the previous order. It was 20 minutes before the high-speed boat departed from its dock. From the first report, it will take the time for the high-speed boat to arrive in the affected areas from 33 minutes to 37 minutes. The Korea Coast Guard confirmed that VTS reported the accident at 6:05 a.m., but failed to explain why it concealed the incident. Such actions are Moon Jae-in, maritime police response which runs contrary to the president's instructions. The president ordered “field commander's direction to the Korea Coast Guard and Navy maritime police, who arrived at the scene worked side-by-side for boat rescue operation to do my best.” 1 minute 7 a.m., three days high. The president also the rescue site at crisis management center said, "" people since budged an inch in doubts, with regard to active public about matters necessary to avoid confusion.Try not to have, had to give instructions. Regarding the Coast Guard's handling of the crisis, Huh Ho-rae, a professor of marine science at Kunshan University, said, "" Four minutes per second is an important time for survivors in the water, "" adding, "" We're at sea. "" Meanwhile, the Coast Guard revealed the track, speed and direction of the boats Myeongjin 15 and Hangang-1 at a briefing on the day. At the time of the accident, Myeongjin 15 was traveling at 12 knots in the direction of 216 degrees southwest of the road. The pier was going at a speed of 10 knots at 198 degrees.

I listened to it vividly when I connected one of my students. It's not just the universities. Now, workers, housewives, and even the elderly are investing in these virtual currencies. Under these circumstances, it is the government's concern whether or not to regulate it. If you regulate virtual currency, you will see that it is more problematic to give out signals such as "" institutional currency. "" But as we don't regulate it, the side effects continue to appear, so we're worried about what to do. Connect experts. She is the director of Research Center for Block Chain, Dongguk University.

I was watching four to five times a year. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung ; By the way, how much is it now? Park Seong-jun : This year alone, it has increased by 8 to 10 times. The point is, when you start last year, I think it's going to be two, 30 times higher. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > 2 to 30 times more than usual. What worries me is the fact that it is like running a diversion board just like spending money? Mr Park : Is it not known that the encrypted lung has a high return on revenue? So the average person is just looking at the return. And the reality is that people are seeing things like that. So what is encrypted money for these people? So it's more necessary to teach people the dangers of investing, not of speculation, and then build a system for the healthy development of encrypted currency. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Now, experts are saying that it is encrypted money, and that's another word for virtual money, ladies and gentlemen. But I don't have any virtual money."" There used to be things like an acorn in the cyber world, so experts call them encrypted currency, encrypted currency. I think you can listen to it with reference. Eventually, I'll tell you, the Director of the Center now says that although the idea is good in itself, it's distorted in our market, and it's flowing like a displacing board, and you're concerned about this? Mr Park : The most important thing is the distortion. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Does the government's agony regulate? I'm in a very worrying position whether I should intervene or not. If they intervene, it will be perceived as a currency of control, just like a legal currency, and the money will be raised more. We can not afford to overheat the diverter. I'm worried about this, and I don't want to get involved in any kind of scam or hacking, and I'm concerned about this. What do you think we should do? I think there is a side to activating the cipher currency in a sound manner. And I think we should find a balanced solution to catch the two rabbits that need consumer protection. And I was originally told by the government to regulate as a solution. ◇ Do you think it is time for the government to intervene? Park Seong-jun : I am late. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung, are you late? But the government has no reason to intervene now, this virtual currency. You can't get in with any kind of evidence. So if it is a new technology and a new industry, new policies are needed. So first, a new policy needs to come out on how we can develop our country with encrypted money, or with a block chain, and then the regulations come out linked together. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > This is worldwide"
"And you think it's going to end up like this, like, when the bubble bursts, it's going to produce victims. ^ Park Seong-jun > Yes. You are saying it correctly. Now, usually, cipher experts are constantly saying that this is a guideline, in a way, from governments. They are constantly insisting on regulation. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Government must intervene. So I thought, well, I don't know about the other side. The moment we step in and say, ' It's going to be more activated, it's going to be a recognition. ' The victim continues to turn around and this market is distorted. ^ Park Seong-jun > Yes. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Professor, what are you concerned about? What would you say about it if the government stepped in and gave you the wrong signal, such as the institutional currency? Bakseongjun > wrong signal already many people have wrong signal now. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Already got the wrong signal, even if the government didn't give you one? Park Seong-jun : To me, the general public is not interested in whether it is money, or whether it is in a legal position. I'm just investing to make money. That's the reality. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Yes, I put one million won in it, but it is said that there are one hundred million years old. I just jumped in with these rumors. ◆ Park Seong-jun > Already people have the wrong signal. And I'm very sorry to hear that that's not the purpose of the encrypted currency.

The Wall Street Journal reported on July 4 (local time) that Ireland will impose 13 billion euros (about 16.75 trillion won) in taxes on Apple from early next year.Apple and Ireland have reportedly agreed to manage Ascorot funds related to tax collection. Ascouro fund means to hold the funds in a third party until the transaction ends.Apple has paid taxes to Ascorot, but has not decided to reverse its decision of the European Commission through lawsuits filed with the European Court.Irish Finance Minister Fastchai Donoho said yesterday, We expect taxes from Apple when the process of who runs escrow fund accounts and who will manage the new collection is over. Donoho added that the time will be around in the first quarter of next year.Tim Cook, Apple Chief Executive Officer. (Photo : Cinet) Apple's year-long tax war has virtually ended in a victory for the EU.■ Low corporate tax rate plus actual tax evasion via the head office began when the European Union raised questions about what the Irish government has given Apple a tax break. In the process, the EU sued both the Irish government and Apple, and made a supercontinent.The first pressure came last August. The Irish government issued an order to Apple to pay off the taxes it received, two things that the EU raised at the time.The first is that Ireland has helped to reduce the legal tax by imposing a steep tax on Apple.First of all, Ireland's corporate tax rate is 12.5 %, which is lower than other European regions. Germany (29.27 percent) and France (3.1.3 percent) are only one third of countries.Ireland, without any special industrial facilities, is luring multinational companies with low corporate tax rates.But the Irish government is one step further.European Commission data on how Ireland favored Apple. (Photo : EC) Ireland has approved the relocation of a substantial portion of its reported earnings to the head office. The Head Office is not in any country. In other words, they are not subject to taxation.The EC argues that Apple virtually evaded paying a large proportion of its profits earned in Europe in this manner. The Irish government, too, has condoned the procedures, although it knew it.The European Commission (EC), also known as the European Union administration, released figures during its investigation last year. The Irish government only applied an annual tax rate of 0.005 % to 1 % to Apple's European gains from 1991 to 2007.Apple earned 16 billion euros in 2011 in Europe. However, the double tax amount was only 50 million euros. The rest of the money was transferred to the head office.The EC then ordered Ireland to receive full fair tax return from Apple by January 3, 2017.The EC has not relaxed its controls this year. European Commission Commissioner Margrete Westager filed a suit with a European court last October against the Irish government. It is interpreted that they succumbed to the pressure and agreed to additional tax collection by Ireland and Apple.Irish Finance Minister Donoho said, "" I met with Executive Director Margrethe Westager before the news conference. ""Apple, according to UPI officials, immediately after the tax payment announcement, said, We still expect to reverse the EC decision in the European Court.Kim Ik-hyeon, a reporter for Naver (sini@zdnet.co.kr) and [Weather] on October 10, is very cold in the early winter because it is cold everywhere.I had a strong chill all night.It was very cold this morning.The mercury in Daegwallyeong enjoyed its first morning in Busan at minus 15 degrees Celsius and Seoul at minus 8.1 degrees Celsius.I think the cold wind will blow and keep me in a flutter all day long.

"An orange can fill a day's requirement with vitamin C by eating only two. A tangerine, a winter seasonal fruit from health Chosun, DB, is a lump of vitamin that needs to be peeled. As oranges harvested when it is cold are high in vitamin C, they are more healthy when eaten these days. 89 percent of oranges are composed of water, and contain not only vitamins but also sugars, organic acids, amino acids and minerals. Vitamin C per 100g of oranges has 55-60 milligrams. As vitamin C recommended for daily nutrition is 60-100 mg for adults as determined by the Korean Society for Effects, people who consume two medium oranges each day can get sufficient daily intake.Vitamin C makes metabolism and builds immunity for cold weather. In addition, citric acid, which handles the effects of acidity, releases fatigue and cleans the blood. There are also many components in oranges that help bone health. According to a 2011 study by Minouraskiura Dr. at the Japanese Fruit Research Institute, consuming high doses of betacryptosanthine and vitamin C reduces the frequency of osteoporosis. Betacryptoxanthine is a kind of carotinoid, a component of the color of oranges. The beta cryptosanthine content of oranges is 3.22 times higher than that of oranges and 161 times more than lemons. In his study, Dr. Sugiura said that betacryptosanthine is the most absorbent of carotenoid and stays in the body for a long time. Also, the white stream-like part of tangerine and its skin is rich in phytochemical, or hesperidin. Hesperidine keeps the blood vessels healthy. Vitamin C and fiber are abundant, which lowers cholesterol in blood. Therefore, it is better to eat together the white part of the tangerine.They are less shiny, have a few flaws, and are more delicious than the shiny, shiny, golden oranges. The shiny one can be artificially coated, picking the underdone citrus. It is better to choose oranges with a dark pink belly button, which is appropriate rather than too big, and whose ears stick blue while the tip is tight. If you keep a box of oranges on hand, you can keep them fresh for 10 to 15 days by eating them within a few days and rinsing the rest in salt water. After washing in salt water, wash the water well and eat it on a cool veranda or in the refrigerator./ Lee Bo-ram, Chosun Ilbo reporter, Who are 590 of the nation's top names?The representative Health Site Health.com, a shortcut to datkeom and an 80 year old woman, express their warmth by building friendships beyond age, race, and gender through mobile games. Foreign media reported yesterday (Tuesday) on a 20-something man who flew 1,600 kilometers into his 80s to meet his grandmother.Spencer Slein, 22, of New York City, frequently enjoyed playing the famous American mobile game Words With Friends, which was similar to a crossword puzzle.And I accidentally played a game with 81-year-old Rosalin Guttman from Palm Beach in Florida last summer.The two friends, talking with each other and becoming friends, have built friendships by playing games together over 300 times since.Sleigh told Mrs. Gurtman the secret that he had not told anyone.However, when he moved to New York a few months ago, he decided to stop playing games because of the circumstances and naturally cut off conversation with Mrs. Guttman.Their relationship, which seemed to end with mobile games, has been repeated by chance. Hearing about their special friendship, Ms. Jane Butler, the mother of Slayan's friend, offered to let them actually meet.Butler, also a pastor, says "" Slayon and Gertman's friendship is deeply touching these days of fear and division. ""Butler decapitated the contact information of Mrs. Guttman and flew with Mr. Slayan to Florida.And the two friends I finally met on the first day had a hot hug and released a series of receptions."" Mrs. Guttman offered me a nice lunch, "" Slayen said. "" We shared not only game stories, but also government policies with my family. ""Their stories were revealed through the Twitter accounts of Slein and Butler. As the news spread through social media, Zynga, the U.S. social networking game developer who created the game, said, "" Slayan and Gutman are very impressed to share their stories with you. "" "" Thank you for saying that this is a good example of game development. ""  Kim was shaken between hope and reality. Although the ministry wanted to be the headquarters before the birth, Kim knew that the department could not be an option.Considering that he could go to the branch office as a chiak, Kim wished for a branch and was transferred to the branch. Since he had worked at a branch office during the first few years of his employment, he did not think it would be too much of a problem if he worked hard at the head office or branch.However, the feeling of deprivation that Kim felt on her first day at the office was beyond imagination. The branch manager told Kim who returned from maternity leave that since he had a long leave of absence and was new here, let's give his colleagues a pat on the back on the back on the back. Kim, who had to endure a low performance rating for promotion by another colleague for about five years during her six-year career before giving birth, was no better than giving up promotion."" I got a good review for the last year and a half, but when I went into maternity and childcare leave, I was naturally excluded from the promotion, "" Kim said. "" I was forced to give birth and take care of my baby. "" She felt ashamed of herself for the cries of her seniors who had left the company one after another when they had dreamed of becoming a successful cockerman.According to the National Statistical Office's Economic Activities Population Survey, the participation rate of women aged between 30-39 years old was 60-39 %. Of course, it was 20-29 (65.6 %) and 40 years old (65.6 %). In other words, the persecution and disadvantages have made the economic activities of women in their thirties most vulnerable to work.Even if they choose to work hard to solve their will to continue their careers and financial difficulties, one out of four people can not live through the year. According to the Ministry of Employment and Labor, the annual employment rate of childcare leave last year was 76.6 percent.Social devices to protect childcare leave are being supplemented, but they are often ignored by employees using vertical relationships with each other, even when defined. If you throw caution to the wind and start a legal battle, you will find an individual who is dealing with a gigantic organization. Song (38), who quit after a year of family leave, said, "" As it was difficult to get a job as a deputy director or manager, the employees ' promotion was delayed by more than two years was not an act of selfish importance. ""Big business is better than big businesses. Some small and medium businesses have assigned administrative office women to work as childcare leave and then to work as production jobs, while others have recommended to resign after seeking alternative workers. They even demand that the workers leave the company before the time of childcare allowance is paid, and they openly exclude those who take paternity leave from the job.Disbenefits and persecution are carried out outside the company. Park, who recently visited a commercial bank for a loan, was shocked by an extremely low loan ceiling. The bank has set a loan ceiling based on income of less than one million won per month. When we discussed the annual income trend, which is based on the year of paternity leave, Park said, "" It was difficult to answer that childcare leave holders were not able to return to work. ""Experts point out that the blind perception of childcare on the surface of the water has only shifted to the surface.Yang Hyun-ah, a law school professor at Seoul National University, said, "" The bigger the problem is that the number of childcare women who take paternity leave and return to work is to go by the first and second stages. "" The ratio of childcare leave for the past year rose from 4,472 in 2014 to 7,616 last year. It is predicted that the proportion of the total number of childcare leave holders, which stood at only 2.0 percent in 2010, will exceed 6 percent this year.[Use of a reporter / Yunjiwon trainee] : Unrestricted premium reading beyond news.

""North Korea launched a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICP-15) in Korea early Monday morning via a "" Hwasung-15, "" which could reach the entire United States. AFP : News 1 Woo Dong-myeong (Seoul = News 1), a reporter at the Korea Press Center, is expected to pay a visit to the Korean Peninsula one week after North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICP-15) attack.Stephen J. Dujarik, United Nations spokesman for the United Nations, said Thursday (local time) that United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Jeffrey Peltman will visit North Korea. The visit will last from July 5 to 10, and will be met with Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Ryan and Vice Foreign Minister Bahk Myong-kook. However, the spokesman did not mention whether the meeting was scheduled to take place with the new leader. The visit was made after North Korea invited Peltman to the North at the U.N. General Assembly last September, according to U.N. spokesman Dujarik. However, it is particularly unusual since it is the highest level of visits by the United Nations immediately after North Korea's armed provocation. National Diplomat Professor Kim Hyun-wook said, As North Korea and the United States are not willing to budge from their stance, they are moving toward a strong steel framework and China is not likely to intervene at all.In particular, Kim said, I heard some comments on how it would be possible to intervene on the peninsula from a distance, but I think it would be a timely visit. But it is questionable how actively the U.N. chief of staff can visit North Korea so that he can adjust the stance of North Korea and the United States, he said.Some predict that U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Gutechs ' visit to North Korea will be discussed during Peltman's visit. In fact, Dujarik's spokesperson asked if Feltman was ready for Mr. Antonio Gutechs ' visit to North Korea, "" He is ready to mediate whenever necessary. "" In this case, it is noteworthy whether the heightened tension surrounding the Korean Peninsula can be eased and the situation changed. However, it is forecast that the visit by high-ranking U.N. officials will not lead to a change in the situation soon. Accordingly, the situation on the Korean Peninsula is likely to remain the same. Woo Jung-yup, a researcher at the Sejong Institute, played a special role in mediating between the United Nations, saying North Korea is more likely to say that it suffers only from ordinary people due to hostile sanctions against its own country. Woo added, It is because the United Nations won`t have any special proposals for the missile development, and North Korea will also tell the meeting that their missile development is justifiable. South Korean media outlets reported earlier that the United Nations World Food Programme has stopped providing food to North Korean kindergarteners since last month.flyhighrom@news1.kr"

Captain Oh and crew member Lee boarded the boat with 20 to 60 fishermen who arrived at the dock early. The Coast Guard officials had checked the list of crew members and issued cautions such as wearing life jackets. However, the impact was so great that the boat capsized at 6:05 a.m., just five minutes after leaving the dock. The oil tanker Myeongjin 15 (336 tons), which was headed south to Pyeongtaek from GS quay in Incheon, hit the lower left corner of the pier.

Three of the crew members were ordered to go to the boat's moorings at 6:13 a.m., but there were seven private vessels around, so they set sail at 6:26 a.m. to carry them around.A tanker and a fishing boat collided with each other two miles south of Yeongheung Bridge in Ongjeong-gun, Incheon on the morning of July 3, and a rescue crew from the sea crashed in an accident. Incheon and Pyeongtaek, both capable of underwater search, did not arrive until one hour after the accident. The Pyeongtaek rescue team from Jebudo Island arrived at 7:17 a.m. and Incheon rescue team arrived at the scene at 7:36 a.m. respectively. Three survivors were managed to rescue the "" air pocket "" built in an underground cabin under the fishing boat's steering room. Shim (31), who was rescued with two of his friends, testified, I saw the sunlight outside, saw what it was like, shouted ' Here's a man ' at the Coast Guard. It was two hours and 43 minutes after the accident.◇ Eleven deaths on board … Until the last two were found missing on board ... `` According to the tide, "" [CG] [Yonhap News Agency TV Supply] arrived at the scene at 8 a.m. and died. Then, they searched the ship for about an hour until 9:06 a.m. and then found nine dead. Eleven people were rescued from the ship. The Korea Coast Guard estimated the accident to have caused heavy casualties as fishermen in the cabins were unable to escape due to the impact. Some say passengers in the cabin fainted from shock and suddenly drank water, leaving many people dead. The other two were killed while drifting at sea. The Coast Guard is focusing its search on the captain Oh and her fifty-seven-year-old aunt, who were never found on board. The two areas were divided into nine areas, and a patrol boat, navy vessel, air force ship, and aircraft were sent to night search. As a result, the bodies of Oh and Lee were recovered one after another near the sea on July 5, the third day of the search.▽ Oil tanker Myeongjin No.15 (Incheon = Yonhap News Agency) = Oil tanker Myung-jin (Incheon Regional Police Agency) is anchored at the pier of the North Korea Coast Guard and confirmed that the vessel is in the middle of Incheon. Captain Myeongjin No.15 (37) and a deck crew member Kim (46) were shot at 6:05 a.m. on July 3 and killed 9.77 tons of fishing boats one mile southwest of Yeongheung Island. As search for missing persons is finished, the cause of the accident is also being investigated more quickly. The Coast Guard arrested Captain Myeongjin 15 and a member of the deck crew, Kim (46), on charges of crashing into the pier and killing 13 fishermen (overturning their professional negligence by default, death, and accident). Captain Jun told Coast Guard officials that I saw (before the collision) a fishing boat but knew I could get away. He was holding the steering machine at the steering room of the tanker during the accident, but another on-call worker was confirmed to have left the steering room. The interrogation of the suspect before the arrest of the arrest warrant is scheduled for July 6 at the Incheon District Court. chamse@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"[1] Where the power of the Chinese economy and political conflicts can be retaliated as the economy and the great risks of the free trade system are : "" Nobody can overcome such a crisis by opening up a new market in Norway or China. To invest in China, a bastion of free trade. "" In Davos Forum in January, President Xi Jinping, China, accusing Trump the protectionism of the United States president said. Xi has also stressed "" pro- chin "" as a major pillar of neighboring countries ` diplomacy. They are being friendly, being truthful, sharing benefits, and accepting.However, what China actually did in international trade was the exact opposite. When Taiwan's People's Democratic Party's Government of Taiwan was inaugurated in May 2016, Chinese tourists to Taiwan plummeted. After President Qie Yingwen refused to recognize China's Communist Party's ' one-China ' principle, the Chinese government banned travel to Taiwan's collective groups. When Mongolia last November allowed Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama to visit the country, China immediately imposed customs fees on Mongolian cars crossing its border, and stopped providing loans to railway construction and mine development. When the territorial dispute broke out between the Philippines and Scarborough Island in 2012, China banned banana imports from the Philippines and limited bids for Vietnamese companies during territorial disputes in 2014.◇ China's announcement of the placement of the THAAD system by the Korean government in July last year and China's blatant economic retaliation in March this year, which has emerged as a global economic risk, were normalized in late October by Korea and China. However, China's blatant "" trade disarmament, "" such as Saad's retaliation, has emerged as a huge danger to the global free trade system. As a means of punishing the nations that do not stand up to them, they wield the strongest "" economic muscle "" of the world. Even inside China, criticism is raised on the country as being "" a great country to live in, "" but China's economic retaliation is not surprising to neighboring countries or remote countries. Sarkozy met the Dalai Lama is president of France in 2008, China has 150 procurement or cancel the Airbus and, 2012, Cameron have a meeting with the Dalai Lama.It was to scrap the 8 billion pounds (about 11 trillion won) worth of investment.The Financial Times in Britain said, "" China's economic retaliation does not consist in boycotting goods or purchasing products from countries or banning the export of resources or raw materials, overseas trips, or fishing, "" adding, "" It just goes to the domestic industry. ""◇ China's economic retaliation was not easy after a short period of time. China's economic retaliation was not so great, either. Norway faced a six-year ban on salmon imports after awarding Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo the Peace Prize in 2010. Norwegian salmon saw their market share decline from 90 percent to 30 percent since 2011. Norway, however, turned to new markets such as the European Union and Korea, and decided to solve the problem by exporting Chinese markets to Hong Kong and Vietnam.Launch a relentless offensive in and around China, which is the chancellor of Germany and the United States president met the Dalai Lama for direct economic but is strongly opposed.It did not take retaliatory measures. If there is a trade war with the United States and Germany, China suffers a great loss.◇ Korean Wave : The Korean wave only hit back China's THAAD retaliation did not have a fatal effect on Korea's economy, but some industries were seriously affected. Sales of Chinese cars at Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. fell more than 40 percent this year. As the Chinese car industry is sluggish, exports of auto parts have decreased by nearly 40 percent. Sales of home appliances, computers and displays also tumbled 10-23 percent from the same period last year. As China's technological prowess grows to a similar level with Korea, these items are not different from Korean products in terms of price and quality competitiveness. `` China is a market where you can sell everything if you're in the top spot and you can't sell anything else, '' said Jeon Byung-seo, director of the China Economic Research Institute. Ahn Deok-keun, a professor at Seoul National University's Graduate School of International Studies, said, As we can not ignore the growing Chinese market from Korea's point of view, we need to upgrade our technology competitiveness to reach the Chinese market and diversify our exports so that we can depend on China. The government accepted the residents ' demand in Seongsan-eup, Seogwipo City, to oppose the construction of the airport, and is drawing keen attention to the result. The government is set to review the plan itself from the ground up when major and scientific errors are found in the previous feasibility study, but officials say it is unlikely.Former Air Policy Director Koo Bon-hwan of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport told a press room at the ministry Friday that he planned to review the feasibility of the controversial Jeju airport. Some residents are demanding a feasibility study in advance on possible violations and possible damage to the area, Gu said, explaining the need for procedural justification and transparent management of residents. The ministry will order a feasibility study at Jeju Island 2 airport by the end of this month and start reviewing it next February or March. 50 million won out of the 3.9 billion won earmarked for establishing basic plans for Jeju Island 2 airport will be invested in the feasibility study. Reassessments are carried out by reviewing the results of previous feasibility studies on paper to determine if there are any major flaws in the process, such as location selection or environmental impact assessment. As the existing pre-validation feasibility study results are reviewed on paper once more, it is analyzed that it is less likely that they will vary significantly from the results of the first survey. When the results of a feasibility study are announced between May and June 2018, a basic plan for constructing the two airports is set up and carried out. The airport is scheduled to be completed in 2025 after a design period of 2-3 years. The ministry has set up a review committee, comprised of experts recommended by local residents and the government, to ensure transparency in reviewing controversial issues and holding public explanation sessions.People who protest against the occupation of Jeju Island's main opposition Democratic Party (JEN=Confederence News) are shouting ` Anti-Seongsan-eup `, the site of Jeju Airport, at the headquarters of the Jeju Island's Dubul Minjoo Island, starting a sit-in protest. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Maritime Affairs announced its plan on November 2, 2015, citing congestion and safety risks at the current airport. The ministry estimates that Jeju Airport currently has an annual capacity of 26 million, with its passenger demand expected to reach 29.7 million last year, and that by 2025, it will have about 33.4 million passengers. The ministry plans to build Jeju Airport with a capacity of 3.30m and 25million people per year by 2025 on a site covering about 5 million ㎡ in Seogwipo City. Residents of Seongsan-eup, Seogwipo City, continued their campaign to oppose the construction of Jeju Island 2 by closing their sit-in protest at the Jeju Island office and continuing the protest in Gwanghwamun, central Seoul, yesterday. Koo decided to conduct a feasibility study before resolving some of the doubts about the Jeju airport construction, said an investigation to ensure its participation in the process is as transparent as possible. As to the possibility of the reinvestigation of the feasibility study to other national infrastructure projects, he said, "" It is almost the first time that the expansion of SOC projects has been carried out in a government project, and this is the first time that the case is known in Jeju.

"[Hankyoreh] Summary-hole scientists who believe that black holes of different origin from stellar origin may exist, also known as ' Mediumable Black Hole Validation ' as possible ' Medium-Sphere Blackhole Wave '. It is known that black holes provided by NASA are caused by the decay of stars due to their massive mass. Stephen Hawking and his fellow researchers have suggested that black holes may have existed in the early 1970s before stars appeared in the universe. Pre-star black hole However, since there was no way to confirm the existence of the primitive black hole, Hawking remained a difficult hypothesis to verify. If you can detect the recent gravity wave coming from space and see the black hole crashes and coalescing events that occurred so far away, you might be able to track them down and you won't know what's next. In a recent paper published in Physical Review Letters (PRL) >, physicists such as Brown University in the United States have shown how far away they would go from what they claim is a so-called "" black hole "" in the ground detected gravity. According to researchers ' calculations, the space time equivalent of ' Red Side ' is 65 million years after the Big Bang. That is, the red wing value of 40 or more indicates the pre-star period of 65 million years immediately after the Big Bang, which is still the period before the stars were born. Therefore, if the red side value is a graver than 40, it is a signal for the merge of the primitive black holes from the pre-substantial era. (Red side value greater than 0 indicates that the wavelength was longer than it was originally, which means that the object is moving away.) This expectation is increasing as the detection of gravitational waves is becoming more frequent. It has been announced that although it has not received much media attention recently, the 6th anti-gravity faction was detected. A group of researchers from Rigo, the United States, the largest ground-ground-wave detector, recently discovered the smallest signal ever detected, GW170608. An analysis of the wave characteristics of this gravity wave captured last summer showed that the signal shows the collision and merge of two small black holes. The following is a diagram of the gravitational wave signals that have been observed so far. The gravitational waves that have so far been detected on earth. Two black holes from distant past space or two neutron stars collide, and a huge gravitational surge occurs to create them. GW170608 is the latest in the development of the Gravity.LIGO provided on June 8, 2017. It is currently scheduled to shut down due to the improvement in the performance of its detection equipment, and it will again increase detection performance in the fall of next year. The researchers who wrote this paper in Physical Review Letters > pointed out that the subtle detection of weak gravity waves in the future is possible, and that the hypothesis of the early black hole could have been validated, and that the hypothesis was explained to them. Is it really possible to observe the original black hole in space right after the Big Bang? When will it be possible? The following are some of Brown's press releases that summarize their hypothesis of the primitive black hole they want to verify. The hypothesis is this. Shortly after the Big Bang, quantum mechanical fluctuations created the distribution of density of objects that we observe in the expanding universe today. However, some of the fluctuations in density are so great that it could have turned into remaining black holes strewn around in space. It is what we call a primitive black hole. The primitive black hole was first proposed by Stephen Hawking and a group of fellow researchers in the early 1970s. But so far, no detection has been made. The existence of raw black holes is still to be determined. "" (Brown University news report) shows that the presence of such raw black holes in its proposed method of detection of black holes may soon be greater than that of red holes, improving the detection technology of future gravity waves. "" Using red flight values, cosmologists measure how far back a cosmic event happened in the past. Red Side is the stretching of light waves that occur as the universe expands. The longer the time past that the event occurred, the larger the value of the red side. In this paper, the researchers accepted the theory that black holes were created by stellar collapses, and they showed us that the time before the day before the day before which black holes were to be merged could no longer be detected (i.e., before the time before the red holes existed). Researchers say that if black holes are considered to be created only in stars, less than one black hole can be detected per year in the red part of the team 40, which is equivalent to 65 million years after the Big Bang. (If so called) a red flight value of 40 or higher, such an event shall not appear at all. The researchers said, ' Red Cross values around 40 are absolutely clear boundaries or cutoff points. ' "" (Brown University news release) Therefore, if the findings point to a detection spectrum of 40, When such a gravitational wave is detected, it means ' one of two, ' the researchers say. One is that we can say that the existence of the primitive black hole has been documented, or else the universe was in a very different state than currently described by the Space Science standard model. When such a grave-wave detection is not sure when it will be possible or may be detected in practice, but when it is detected, it suggests that various scientific explanations of the proto-space and black hole might change. Furthermore, the fact that the primitive black hole is not yet known is considered an important clue to explaining the dark matter that makes up a large part of the universe.

[Daily Subscriptions] People and Animals [KakaoTalk] [Hangyeong-Hangyeong-ile-Newspaper : Rules for Uncontrolled and Redistributing] (Tokyo-Japanese-Japan missile launches by North Korea) Choi Yi-Rak, who will face North Korea's missile launches threats JASHE has the ability to calculate the ballistic and drop points of a launched missile, including ground-positioned radar that detects and tracks missiles, and U.S. military communications satellite information. If the missile is expected to fall into the Japanese territory, it will instruct the Aegis destroyer or the Fartriot, a ground-guided missile, to intercept it. It is equivalent to the brain of Japan's missile defense system. However, the system has been criticized for its limitations in responding to North Korea`s ballistic missiles, according to Nippon Gaizai. For example, if North Korea wants to intercept its high angle intercontinental ballistic missile (ICPs) on July 29, it may have to calculate its missile speed and angle in a flash, but it may not be sufficient to do so. There is a possibility that the current system will not be able to intercept as it delays the calculation of the trajectory and the point of drop for high-angle missiles, a Defense Ministry official said.As a result, the Department of Defense has agreed to drastically improve the performance of JASHE (approximately 3.5 billion won) and budget for the next year's yen (with a photo of a PAC-3 pageant missile deployed at Tokyo Defense Site). The ministry also plans to increase the speed of the missile and forecast location of the drop by increasing the ability of the system to intercept the rapidly falling missile following a high angle launch. In addition, the U.S. plans to increase its ability to detect ballistic missiles and their location in case several missiles are launched simultaneously. The ministry aims to complete the improvement by 2022. Meanwhile, the Japanese government is not clear on what U.S. officials said about North Korea's possible failure to reentry into the atmosphere on July 29. A security official told the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, It is possible that the warheads were intentionally separated the parts by boosters in order to accurately lead the missiles.North Korea's ruling Workers ' Party Chairman Kim Jong Un successfully launched the intercontinental ballistic missile, called "" Hwasung-15, "" the first time a missile was launched, North Korea's Central News Agency reported yesterday.

As a result, Apple, the maker of the final product, and Samsung Electronics, which provides core technology to the iPhone X, are expected to benefit from this plan. The iPhone X is the most expensive phone in the history of smart phone and has the latest technology. In particular, the iPhone X is known as the ' MADE IN KOREA ' product as it adopts the core parts of many Korean companies. In fact, many of the parts of the iPhone X are supplied by Korean makers. Local companies supplying parts for the iPhone X are Samsung Electronics Co., Samsung Display Co., Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co., LG Chem Ltd., LG Innotek Co., and SK Hynix Co. Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix will supply NAND flash and DRAM memory, and Samsung Display will provide a notch display that extends the screen to the top of each other. LG Chem also supplies a ' o ' shaped battery for the iPhone X.Some Korean companies failed to meet their parts yield on time, but they have no technology to make replacement parts, so they are running out of parts to Apple. It is noteworthy that many of them include Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics ' affiliates that make the Galaxy Note 8 and ,0. It looks as if they are reaping the benefits of providing their own technologies to their competitors ' products. That is why Samsung and LG are watching the success of rival iPhone X. Although sales of the iPhone X will increase as it sells, there is a risk that it will negatively affect the sales of its products. They can not afford to hope that their rival movies will make it big.But the loss that iPhone X brings is so great that it asks for risks. A recent counter-point study revealed that Samsung Electronics makes about $ 110 (120,000) in sales of each iPhone X.Considering that the local price of the iPhone X is 999 dollars, more than 10 percent of the shares of Samsung Electronics are to be returned to the market. This is possible because Samsung Electronics provides various sensors, including OLEDs (Organic Light Emitting Diode), a key component of the iPhone X. Apple CEO Tim Cook says more than 15 million units of iPhone X have been sold worldwide since its release on July 3. The average output of this month is estimated to be 4 million units, about a million more than last month. It is highly likely to reach 30 million by the end of the year. Apple expects to sell approximately 130 million units of the iPhone X by the summer of 2018. Samsung Electronics makes about $ 143 billion with iPhone X. It is worth more than 15 trillion won. Of course, it is different from the amount of money Samsung will receive, but it is certain that it is a huge amount. In other words, they are earning annual sales of large companies that can only be found with an iPhone X. Apple is also known to have planned to divide its iPhone X into three models in the second half of next year. In addition to the gadget following the 5.8 inch OLED model previously launched, the iPhone X will have a supply 6.1 inch LCD model and an advanced 6.5 inch OLED model. In this case, Samsung Electronics ` sales volume will grow. Industry watchers say the iPhone X will inevitably play a bigger role as sales and production increases worldwide. A company official said, Apple is a strong competitor for Samsung but also a profitable customer in terms of parts, adding, "" Apple sells the latest technology we bought from Samsung to our customers.

The sluggish automobile and shipbuilding industries have significantly increased the insolvency of related industries. The Financial Supervisory Service announced on July 5 that 174 companies will be restructuring as of small and mid-sized companies as a result of its annual credit risk assessment in 2017. ▽ Work out (creditors ' joint management) = C ranks 10 less than last year, but D class, which is subject to legal management (corporate recovery procedures), increased by 8 companies to 113. However, as the total number of companies surveyed increased to 2275, the proportion of companies subject to restructuring dropped from 8.6 percent to 7.6 percent.Creditors had originally chosen 175 companies to restructure the company. Four companies complained about the results of the evaluation, but only one of them was accepted, so the grade went up from C to B. A FSS official explained, The major creditor bank accepted the objection because the companies involved had a self-determined self-rescue plan, including the sale of factories. By industry, machinery manufacturing was the largest at 26, followed by metal manufacturing (23), automotive parts manufacturing (16), wholesale, commodity brokerage (14) and real estate (11). As the slump of the automobile parts and machinery industries around the front has spread, the number of affected companies has increased to the biggest extent. Meanwhile, businesses such as electronics, electrical equipment, rubber and plastic saw their number of affected by the global economic recovery significantly fall. In the shipbuilding, shipping and construction industries, a total of seven companies were subject to restructuring, a decline of nine from last year. It is the result of intensive restructuring over the past few years, a FSS official said. The amount of new credit at companies subject to restructuring stood at 1.60 trillion won as of the end of September. Dual banks accounted for 85.5 percent of the total, accounting for 1.3704 trillion won. The evaluation shows that the combined amount of additional provisions against bad debts by banks is estimated to reach around 310 billion won. When adding more funds, the ratio of net worth of capital by BIS (International Bank for Settlements) is forecast to fall by 15.7 % from 15.38 % as of the end of June. FSS plans to induce companies subject to restructuring to speed normalization of management and adjustment of their mismanagement. We will also strengthen follow-up measures for companies that creditors do not request work out or revive operations when they report to be rescued from restructuring, said Kim Young-joo, head of the FSS ` credit supervision bureau. If the company delays the restructuring without justification, major creditor banks should take steps to suspend new loans and collect the loans when they expire.

Prosecutors will seek a warrant for Woo's arrest upon completion of investigations into the superintendent's office and the scientific and technical divisions.The Hankook Ilbo confirmed on March 5 that Woo told the NIS at the end of March last year, `` Be sure to thoroughly investigate what is actually possible to check against the superintendent who is critical of the government measures. '' The ministry knew that it could directly pressure the education office by identifying suspicions on personal disgust rather than audit of the education office to criticize conservative groups. Wu is known to have instructed him to give 10 days to look into the matter and make a thorough investigation.The NIS identified teachers from the Korean Teachers and Education Workers ' Union (KTU) as preferential offenders, internal promotions of people with intimate instincts, and private contracts of groups and education offices in question. Prime Minister Nuri Park Geun-hye is illegal surveillance orders of the U, a former senior government budget formulation process of educators who protest against estimated to be designed to suppress.

"○ Medical Executives Complain About Increasing Moderation With Tatts She was alone and had no I.D. He had respiratory problems and was coming down with septic shock. As medical staff took off his shirt, a tattoo of English was found along the clavicle. ' Do not perform resuscitation."" Resuscitation denial "" tattoo on a man's chest (DO NOT RESUSCITATE·NNR). Recent local anti-diatlantic capture A recent American medical journal had the DNR mark tattooed on its body and The sign is intended to stop doctors from CPR or professional cardiac resuscitation when the heart or breathing is stopped. DNR, the patient's ' right to go untreated ', began to make public in the United States in the 1970s and passed in 1991 when a bill regulated by the medical institution to respect the patient's right to self-determination was passed by Congress. Those in favor of DNR note that the survival rate of patients is surprisingly low, since the survival rate after cardiopulmonary resuscitation is only 5-15 %. Nevertheless, due to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, it is hard to ensure the dignity of a human being, such as immersing oneself in the body and hanging various medical instruments. That is why they choose to refuse resuscitation at the last minute and die peacefully. Even though you have made a DNR pledge, you can continue to receive appropriate treatment, such as intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and antibiotics and dialysis.In the United States, intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation are prohibited. The problem is that patients have not been aware of the disease and had only their tattoos on their bodies without any documents. This is because it is not possible to directly question the patient's true intention. In fact, at the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco in 2012, a DNR tattoo was placed on the breast of a patient who needed to have his or her leg amputated. Fortunately, the patient was conscious and he said, "" I want to get resuscitation. "" The tattoo on her chest was put off years ago when she lost a poker game and wasn't removed because she didn't think anyone would really think about it.According to an ethicist, Loresta Kazian Iwa, an anthropologist professor, it would not be respected to give up resuscitation in a tattoo that is not official. `` The DNR pledge is a tool for patients to decide how they want their lives to end. You have to make a wise decision after talking to your doctor.On the other hand, Nancy Bellinger of the Medical Ethics Research Center said, "" Patients may have felt that tattoos were the most reliable way to express their opinions, "" adding, "" They were seriously approached. "" It is a sad indictment of our health system that one must rely on tattoos to be honored, "" said Juan Tenno of the University of Washington in Seattle, where patients have respect for their doctor. Bonus payment is included in the minimum wage and application by industry is considered. Other ways to ensure that minimum wage is kept well, punitive additional charges will be considered. The minimum wage committee will hold a public hearing on July 6 to make such changes public. The alternatives are the result of a research by a Task Force (TF) designed to improve the minimum wage system established in early October. The public hearing presents alternatives to four categories : adjustment of minimum wage ranges ; application of differences by industry and region ; improvement in minimum wage compliance ; and improvement of the cost of living. It is composed of a current maintenance plan and improvement of the system. Lee Jeong-gwon, the reporter`s minimum wage official, said when the TFT`s launch began, We will prepare a public opinion collection plan based on expert research and public opinion, and the ministry will assign a welfare plan to the Minister of Employment and Labor in December. In other words, it is up to the government to follow the reform package proposed by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (TF) and keep the current minimum wage system. If the system changes, it will become effective from 2019. First of all, the range of the entrance will be adjusted. The 40 to 50 million won a year is needed to correct the structure of the lowest wage earners. Experts say the company should consider including bonuses as a substitute for current maintenance. Regular bonuses are usually paid by the day. As the average wage has already been extended due to lawsuits by labor unions and the basis for calculating benefits is that of ordinary wages, it is reasonable to include regular bonuses as the minimum wage. To that end, TF requested to revise laws and regulations that limit the payment and calculation period to one month. Regular bonuses are not paid monthly. However, the company said, "" Considering that regular bonuses are usually paid every three months, the calculation period should be limited to three months. "" There are two alternatives to the current proposed minimum wage package that includes welfare benefits such as food and lodging. The most likely alternative is to include the minimum wage for cash payments and exclude the amount in kind, such as direct feeding. A change in the wage system by companies would make the existing items included in the minimum wage purchase range, the TF said. Another option would be to pay all of the wages, allowances and valuables in the minimum wage. But it is not in line with the purpose of minimum wage laws because it could inflict disadvantages on irregular workers, such as short-term workers, according to TF. The view is that the application of the classification by industry can be made under several conditions. The alternatives were to apply a differential system to those industries with a higher minimum wage rate than the national average, or those with lower per capita value and operating profit. In fact, restaurants sell profits and add value per employee less than 50 percent of the total industry average. Still, it is unreasonable to apply the uniform minimum wage. However, it also provided a complementary view to select the affected businesses only when an interested party requests it, such as labor groups. The method of applying the minimum wage difference by regions was negative. Considering the reality of daily living, the report warned that the gap between regions could worsen and disrupt the unity of the people. In fact, he recommended the maintenance of the current system. Experts also said it was necessary to consider introducing a punitive payment system to improve the minimum wage compliance rate. A system that requires employers who do not pay the minimum wage to pay one or two times more of the minimum wage to their employees. The United States imposes an amount of additional payment equivalent to the minimum wage not paid. Japan charges 500,000 yen. However, the additional payment was imposed with the approval of the Labor Relations Commission. No clear conclusion has been reached regarding the size of the cost of living that is reflected in determining minimum wage. It currently sets the standard of living for the single employee who does not marry. The labor world is demanding that the cost of living for the household be reflected.

""" Check the Principality of Beong-Dong Guang-A Non-Cheong Myeong-Hyun, a bronze seal from the Silla warehouse where food is kept, and from Heungjeon-ri, Samcheok's Heung-ri Temple Site Service, Jong-dong, Jong-dong, Jong-dong (Yonhap news agency, Seoul), last year The Cultural Heritage Administration announced on August 2 that it found a square bronze statue 5.1 cm long at the site of a Buddhist Cultural Properties Research Center in Samcheok, Gangwon Province, and the Buddhist Cultural Properties Research Center in the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. The two seals were buried side by side on the site of building No. 4, and a seal had been kept in a bronze enclosure. The bronze seal was excavated from the site of Heungjeon-ri and revealed that the temple was very famous.Bronze swords from the Unified Silla Dynasty, dating from the foot of Heungjeon-ri, Samcheok, are the seals of Bunwoong Guannan Temple on the left. Bronze swords were equipped with perforated handles and engraved with raised letters to enable the hanging of the ropes. The Buddhist Cultural Properties Research Institute identified the inscription on one of the bronze seals as "" Beonung-Gung Gwana-a-san. "" Beomung means ' Buddha ' and ' Buddha. ' Thus, the term Beonung-Guan-a-in means the seal of the Sakyamung-guan government, or Seung-gwan. The calligraphy piece of the seal was considered an early form of the signification of a signet with a long curved stroke of letters, commonly used in the official seals of the Tang Dynasty of China. An official at the institute said, "" Compared to today, the seal of the Beonung-Gun Guang-ah is the seal of the minister or the chief of the bureau. "" The inscription on the book and the inscription on the paper explained in the book explained that the document and the inscription of the document was important. He added that the seals are very similar in overall shape, handle shapes and fonts to those unearthed from Hwangnyongsa Temple Site in Gyeongju, adding that if additional facts are discovered, they will be found to be from the original paper. Another seal bore Gihamun, an abstract design with several bent strokes, as if it were a "" Buddhist cross. "" Bronze swords were very important for the research at the time of King Sungjinsa, according to Samguksagi and Goryeo. During the Unified Silla Period, the government cast its own officiants, and the national administration of the education office of the dean of the education office of the school's army, Seung-koo Dynasty.In addition, this investigation confirmed that the warehouse containing large jars containing soy sauce, soybean paste, and temple food materials was also stored for the first time in Gangwon-do. It was estimated that 12 jars had been buried in the building's three square feet in front and two square on the side. The unified Silla building sites came from Namwon Silsangsa, Hwangnyongsa Temple Site in Gyeongju and the ruins of Seonggun-dong. Heungjeon-ri Temple Site, under investigation since 2014, is located at the foot of Maebongsan Mountain, which divides the mountain ranges from the water, and is presumed to have died during the Goryeo Dynasty. Until now, an inscription with the word "" national treasure, "" referring to a monk who served as the king's advisor, and a luxurious gilt-bronze crown, were unearthed. Samcheok City Hall is planning to hold an academic conference to prepare for the preservation and utilization of Heungjeon-ri Temple Site in February next year and review the application for the designation of nationally designated cultural assets based on this achievement. psh59@yna.co.kr and Incheon Metropolitan Police Agency's Chief of Staff tipped off and enquiries (Click!) ; [Money TudeI Seung=Sunghoon and Coast Guard Captain Min Dong-hun] [Oil ship captain and deck crew member arrest warrant] ; and GPS Planter.Hwang held a fifth briefing this afternoon on the trip to Youngheungdo and requested the National Institute of Scientific Investigation for evidence of the seizure, including plotter, automatic marine equipment, and CCTVs.The Coast Guard earlier arrested a South Korean captain Jeon (37) and a member of the deck crew, identified as Kim (46), on charges of requesting the accident at 7 p.m. the same day. Prosecutors requested an arrest warrant for the two men at 9:40 a.m. yesterday. The process of refereeing the warrant is expected to be carried out tomorrow.The Coast Guard collected the bodies of Captain Oh (70) and fisherman Lee (57) in their search for the missing person. Oh was discovered at 9:37 a.m. by a fire department on a tidal flat, 1.9 nautical miles from Jindu Port in the southwestern part of Yeongheungdo Island. A passenger named Lee was found at 12:05 p.m. by a Coast Guard helicopter, Flight 507, in the southwest of Jindu Harbor, at 2.1 nautical miles.The captain and passengers alike had their faces checked by family members and the final identification was confirmed via a cross.Although we have tried to improve the rescue system since the Sewol`s issue, it was still not enough, Hwang said, adding, I will thoroughly agree on the public's concerns and comments and make improvements as soon as possible.What you see next door is a free comic strip and a gift batter!

It is not appropriate for me to comment on each individual case that is released on the basis of the enemy, the statement said. In general, limiting the freedom of the body is the public's pressing concern, Moon said, adding, A person who performs this kind of activity may be limiting his or her physical freedom. But it is inappropriate in terms of democracy and constitutional standards, unless it is clear whether even experts will be limited or restored, he stressed. Moon also tries to be strict when filing an arrest warrant, the prosecutor said, We can`t complain about the dismissal of the warrant itself. In the first trial, the guilty verdict can be acquitted in the second trial and vice versa, and we have to acknowledge that part. Still, he reiterated, It is a very important issue as far as body freedom is concerned, and that part needs to have some standards that our community can understand. Chief Justice Kim Myung-soo said earlier that the outcome of the examination on the warrant prosecutions (as a result of the trial) was inappropriate for the prosecution to protest.
