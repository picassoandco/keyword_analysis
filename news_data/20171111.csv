"The government lowered the water level by 1m, but the maximum level of water quality still remains at 14 out of 16 households planning to open up the ground water to the ground, creating worries that the nation might once again face a major crisis due to the "" natural crisis in the river "" project Seven of the programs are expected to open sluice gates every two to three centimeters per hour starting July 13 to reduce the water level from next month to next February. This would lower the water level of the seven columns by 2-8 meters and prevent the water from being trapped.◇ Environment Ministry of Environment, Agriculture, and Land Ministry held a joint briefing at the Sejong Building on July 10 and said, "" Three steps are needed to open three to the Han River (Sejong, Baekje, Gongju) and two steps to the Yeongsan River (Minimum). ""This is the second time that the four pillars have opened their beams partially to the public since June when the first six pillars - Geumgang, Gongjubo - were partially opened. The first phase of the project was to open six of the gate to the river, but when the exact cause and effect of the water pollution did not become clear, the nation will increase the number of the water gates to open up its doors and open the ecosystem to the public.In fact, government research into the first six pieces of water opened in June revealed that although the water level of the beams decreased to one meter, the relationship between the opening of the beams and the growth of algae was not clear.According to the Environment Ministry, the number of "" Namjo Open Flow "" increased even lower when the weir was opened in the Nakdonggang River after comparing the opening and non-opening sections of the river in the past five months.Because of this, the five gates including the three Geumgang beams, the Hapcheon Changnyeongbo and the Yeongsangang Seungchonbo will be fully opened to improve the water quality. Yeongsangang Juksan-bo is planning to lower its water level to a level that will not interfere with the intake facilities, and to a level limited by the nearby residential water supply area of the Changnyeong- Haman-gun River. We need the data to determine what to do with the four rivers, which are scheduled for the end of next year, said an environment ministry official.◇ Ground water levels decreased, and if the level of loss of fishing is significantly reduced, side effects are also worrisome. If the level of the river is artificially lowered, the level of underground water will inevitably fall as underground water flows out to the stream, such as agricultural land outside the river. This will affect the growth of crops such as vinyl houses near the stream. As the fishing road installed on the beam has lost its function, such as due to the loss of fish fishing, small power plants in the beam will not function properly.The cost of expanding the opening of the beam and follow-up measures is also high. Agriculture Minister Kim Jong-eun told a briefing, We will not make up for the problem by spending 12 billion won on the equipment, saying, There are 25 pumping stations that can suffer problems if we open the seven bags to the lowest level. They say that they will install underwater pumps and temporary water tanks to raise agricultural water from the bottom of rivers that have reached their lowest levels.The government plans to respond by temporarily closing the sluice gates in case of any side effects resulting from the opening of the beam. We can open the beam slowly and gradually, but we can stop it if negative effects occur or raise the water level again, said Environment Minister Ahn Byung-ok.[Seunghyuk reporter] [Downship.8] - Cooprights ilbo Chosun Ilbo & Chosun.com, No unauthorised reproduction and redistribution - job protection is fastest by 2005.....5 for senior citizens by extension of retirement barriers ...Lee Yoo-eul, a reporter at Yonhap News Agency, reported that the relative poverty rate of the nation's seniors over the age of 66 is the highest among OECD members. Korea is the fastest aging country in the OECD, the OECD pointed out.According to the OECD's recent report on the prevention of unequal aging, the relative poverty rate among the elderly aged 66 to 38 was 46.7 percent on July 11.[Capture the Relative Poverty Rate] The relative poverty rate is the proportion of the population to which the middle income is less than 50 %. Median income refers to the income of the person in the middle of the Korean population when they are ranked in order of income. The relative poverty rate of the nation`s 66 to 75-year-olds was 4 times higher than the OECD average of 10.6 percent and those aged 76 were 4.2 percent than the OECD average of 14.4 percent. Compared to the nation's total population of 14.4 percent, a person aged 66 to 75 was three times more poor and a person aged 76 or older had 4.2 times more poor. "" The rate of senior citizens in OECD countries is closely linked to the overall population rate, but in Australia and Switzerland, the rate of elderly people is much higher and Korea is the highest, "" the OECD report said. Among OECD members, Japan was the country with the most improvement in aging. However, South Korea had the fastest aging country. Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain are also aging quickly, the report said. Korea saw the biggest increase in the cost of supporting the elderly, or the proportion of people aged 65 years or older, to the productible population aged 15-64.Between 1998 and 2015, the only countries with more than a 2-percent annual increase in their old age support were Japan (3.3 percent) and Korea (2.8 percent). Korea is forecast to face the burden of the fastest aging OECD country by 3.8 percentage points each year by 2050, the OECD estimates. Senescene support costs were forecast to rise by 2.0 to 2.1 percent each year in Greece, Iceland, the Czech Republic and Portugal, 2.4 to 2.7 percent in Ireland, Slovenia, Spain, Poland and Slovakia, and by 2.9 to 3.0 percent in Chile, Turkey and Mexico. The OECD report explained why Korea's child support is rising dramatically and the poverty rate for the elderly is so high in 1950 : "" In a traditional Confucian society, it was the duty of the children to support their parents, so it was the young people who flocked to the city in 1988.OECD's general trend toward the top-gol park in Jongno-gu, Seoul, is to increase the gap in health between socio-economic groups due to aging, and to increase the income inequality as the next generation moves forward, the report said. To ease the rigid inequalities, the pension system must be better protected against the jobless and long-term unemployment of the elderly, and the expanded scope of the pension system to eliminate job barriers for the elderly, while strengthening the scope of redistributing of non-regular workers and businesses. yulsid@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"

Lim, who was sentenced to a warrant with Kim, is accused of engaging in political activities by serving as the head of the Defense Policy Bureau, which led the cyber headquarters from 2011 to 2013. He allegedly received about 30 million won per month from former cyber commander Yeon Je-wook for two years. Prosecutors believe the fund originated from a special NIS activity fee. banghd@yna.co.kr It is often said that the idea of helping the needy is too much to forgive a debt that has to be paid or that the delinquent payment is not charged at all. Anyone who has paid off the debt regularly has a relative sense of deprivation, and most importantly, the principle of "" debt payment "" is contradictory. Disapprobation with the new government's policies is not always grounded. But when you look at the other side of the policy, it's hard to say it is absolutely provocative. Most of all, the government is not designed to pay off long-term debt owed by taxpayers. The Government announces its debt write-off policy this month. Next month, we are going to present a plan to support the delinquent. Though it is beyond criticism for its policy objectives, it is also criticized as a populist policy, which reduces debt and interest payments that must be made. The target debt write-off package, which stipulates that the amount of tax payment has not been credited to the debt relief policy, is 40 people who have failed to repay debts worth 10 million won or less out of 2.8 million outstanding debt held by the National Happiness fund. If the statute of limitations is still in place and you don't pay your debts in more than 10 years, you're actually going to be in the poorest, and you're going to get out of debt in two. If so, the Happiness fund may question whether it suffers a substantial loss, or whether taxpayers ' money is spent on this process. The answer is no. National Fund funds created to Park Geun-hye, former president of the presidential election pledge of happiness. The candidate pledged to reduce debt owed by 3.22 million delinquent borrowers by setting up an 18-trillion-won national happiness fund to help the debt-laden poor. But in reality, the fund's business has shrunk to 1.5 trillion won. The government has not spent a penny on that. Lee Myung-bak, the former president of the jeosinyongja as state-initiated credit recovery fund was created by promising to the debt funds move on to national happiness. Simply put, I just replaced the nameplate. The credit recovery fund was also funded by the contributions of banks, so the government's finances were free of any charges. That is why many say the government has not spent a penny on the ' debt-loss debt write-off ' project but has only prided itself with money donated by banks. Happiness fund hardly loses collection agencies? return of 50 %. The Fund made debt adjustments by purchasing overdue bonds at a cheap price from banks, lenders and other financial institutions. For the debtor, the debt to the financial institution went to the happiness fund. When a debtor asked the Happiness fund to make a debt adjustment, they would give me about 50 percent off the original amount, and then I would split the rest in 10 years to repay it. The Fund will allocate future collection gains to encourage financial institutions to sell overdue bonds at a cheap price. It's not a losing proposition even for financial institutions. We can pass on overdue bills that are hard to collect to the fund, and we can expect more in the future. According to the National Happiness Fund, the amount of overdue loans that the Happy Fund collected from more than 2.5 million people who were delinquent was estimated at 1.3.197 trillion won from May 2013 to July of this year. The purchase of 16.45 trillion won worth of overdue bonds at 5.2 percent of its principal, resulted in an additional 409.4 billion won withdrawn from the purchase price. When you look at the return, it's 50 percent. So, it has been pointed out that the Happiness fund is more dependent on collecting bonds. In fact, only 582,000, or 20 percent, of the 2.8 million people who have been repackaged by the happiness fund have ever received debt. Eventually, the government said it would completely forgive the debt of a debtor whose principal amount is less than 10 million won, but the actual debt is much less than 10 million won, and the fund loses face value. And the government has decided not to make 400,000 people eligible for benefits, but to actually sort out the poorest based on strict evaluations. In the context of this, it is hard to think of as a reckless debt relief policy. Still, it is quite incontrovertible that all the previous Government's drastic policies of "" anticlimax "" have not been met before. In particular, the government's latest measure is intended to be a one-time measure, such as the special amnesty for the Aug. 15 Independence Day. In this case, the criteria for cancellation can be highly contentious for fairness. It is not convenient, but the default period is less than 10 years, which makes it unlikely that they will be exempt from payment. Lee Myung-bak, the former president and Park Geun-hye, former president a candidate, funky jeosinyong rescue pledge was unveiled. The former president is 3.2 million people's pledge, the origin and a large scale, before the president is 7.2 million credit defaulters of the rhetoric that he would reduce the debt burden. But it was all just a compliment. They all pushed forward with a strong will, but the moral hazard debate caused them to lose their promise. The success of the new government's policies depends in fact on how it copes with these controversies.

It has been silent for nearly two months since North Korea's last provocations last September.North Korea's president to breath and keep an eye on his Asian tour cards and that scenes between the United States and North Korea in the middle of the prevailing opinion is to provide the possibility of contact.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has not scheduled to make a military disclosure in nearly two months since he attended the May 15 launch exercise. Considering that he focused mostly on military action since 2012, it is surprising that he has recently made such moves.In particular, Kim Jong-un has been out of action in the economy for 93 days from June 21 to September 20. During that time, North Korea tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICT-14) with a middle-range ballistic missile (IRBM) and then conducted its sixth nuclear test.But the North's provocations have since subsided, completely changing the Kim Jong-un's momentum. The latest public demonstration by the North Korean media was a visit to the factory on March 16.Last month, he visited Pyongyang cosmetic factories and Ryowon shoe factories, visited farms under the military base in September and fruit farms in South Hwanghae-do, and worked as an island school building and a mountain farm teacher on Sept. 12.Most analysts say the North is ready to take a breather from its nuclear and economic construction projects. It is interpreted that with the U.S. openly talking about military options, it intends to concentrate on internal unity rather than on military provocations.In particular, recent president is going on his Asian tour cards and U.S. aircraft carrier three sequential approach as North Korea has pre-emptively in the East Sea on July 11, the South Korean operations area.Likely to see how the overall flow than to act.They say they focus on the people's livelihood because they fear that the people's defection could worsen as a result of tougher international sanctions on North Korea.

When I opened the door, the heat was really hot. About 300 mining machines were operating steadily in a space of 132 ㎡ (40 pyeong). The Mining Machine is a computer that is modified to allow you to pick up only virtual bills. The buzz was deafening. One employee called it "" a dig. "" About 10 fans and a large air conditioner were cooling off the computers ' temperatures. Five ventilation vents poured out the window. In the summer, the indoor temperature is up to 40 ℃, but nowadays it gets chilly and stays at 30 ℃. One mining machine generates heat at 55 ℃.Each mine had a name tag on it : ' This ○○ 1, this ○○ 2, this ○○ 3 … ' followed by a number, which means one person has as many machines. The computer is paid by the virtual currency investor, who charges 100,000 won per computer to manage the currency. We are coming to the scene to see authors, housewives, office workers and college students alike, the guide said, Some of us are in our thirties. In the other room, an engineer was fixing a broken machine. Three people are working the shift 24 hours. This is because the machines should not stop for even a moment at the virtual currency mining site, where time is money.There are also known as mining areas where the bit coins, mud flats, dash's, ripple, shiacoin coins, cyakin …. Various virtual money investment boom produces them on its own. To obtain virtual money, one must either buy it from the exchange or uncompose one's own programs to obtain virtual currency. In the latter way, the word "" canda "" is used. A company that sells and manages computers that have exposed CPUs and mainboards without a case, and a large quantity of mining or procurement of mining equipment to people is called a mining area.The key to virtual currency extraction is reducing electricity bills. As a result of the use of high performance graphics cards, one mining unit can use hundreds of ㎾h of electricity per month. Most Korean households spend less than 400 ㎾h a month. Including the cost of running the cooling equipment, the industry explains that when an individual rolls on the machine, they are ' bigger than double belly '.The vast majority of mining areas are concentrated in the industrial park or Gangwon Province because of electricity charges. Using industrial electricity or initially building a mining site in an area with low annual average temperatures. These days, people visit Korean mining sites for their home town's high electricity bills. Some businesses even illegally buy land and build diggings in rural areas to benefit from agricultural electricity. When asked if they could see the site, many of them answered, "" There is a mine in cheap China or cold Iceland.Less than one virtual currency a month can be extracted from high-performance computers. The amount of land that can be extracted is different for each occasion. The bag is currently available to pick out about 0.9 pieces a month. Each unit costs 345,000 won (467,000 U.S. dollars) per unit. Since the machines can be built locally, graphics cards at Yongsan Electronic Shopping Center once were in short supply. The machines cost 3.5 to 4.8 million won per unit.The general trend of virtual money is still the bit coin. This year alone, the price has jumped more than seven-fold, selling at 8 million won per unit on July 7. "" We import all of the machines so we can install the machines in December even if we sign up now, "" said an official at the mine.

The Earth unconsciously applies the body to resist gravity, but in space with little or no gravity, it does not need to do so, and the musculoskeletal system is weakened. In the past, during their one-year stay on the space station, Russian astronauts saw their muscle proteins drop by about 20 percent.Recent studies have shown that when you are weightless for a long time, it is not only muscle and bone density that changes. According to a team of scientists at South Carolina University in the United States, "" when they analyzed images of astronauts ' brains, the longer they stayed in the universe, the higher the brain position in the brain, the higher the pressure they found. ""Brain imaging before and after Space Travel ...

"U.S. P-3C maritime surveillance aircraft, widely used in Western Navy. The Korean navy also runs 16 P-3C enhancements in the P-3C.  A North Korean submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM) that will attack U.S. troops stationed in South Korea and Japan under the deep sea is expected to be launched in the event of an emergency at the U.S. Pacific Command.The Navy has operated 16 P-3 CKs that have upgraded from the U.S. P-3C since the 1990s. P-3C Korean F-3C aircraft shipped in Korea to replace the used P-3C aircraft stored in the U.S. Navy's reserve, improving its detection capabilities for submarines. P-3C can detect only wide ocean targets, but P-3 CKD is equipped with multipurpose radar that can identify the vessels anchored in the port and also the moving targets on the ground. It also has electronic warfare equipment (ESM) that can trace back radar transmissions to locate them, and magnetic detection equipment (MAD) that can detect magnetism from steel that consists of submarine hull.However, it has been continuously criticized that the topography of the three-sided Korean Peninsula is not sufficient to match the patrol aircraft eight at sea. In addition, North Korea has about 70 submarines, including its old Romio-class, and has decided to strengthen its anti-submarine submarine, including the construction of six new anti-polar SLBM units in the early 2020s, to counter North Korea's threat. The next project to introduce the patrol aircraft for P-V8, the U.S., P-1 (Japan), and C-295 (Europe), which will cost approximately 2 trillion won for each of the two sides of the race. The government also strongly considered the possibility of remodeling the once used S-3C. However, many say it is appropriate to introduce a new patrol aircraft in terms of its use in the front line for more than 20 years, so the use of used gas has been canceled. As the performance requirements for the next generation patrol aircraft operation (ROC) are known to be rapidly flying long distances (P-SAH) and strong armed capabilities such as four torpedoes are known to be the focus of U.S. Boeing's strong force - Saab launched their first challenge to the patrol aircraft market with Soph fish.P-82A maritime patrol aircraft landing on a runway at a Boeing factory in Seattle, Washington. The U.S. Navy Provider P-V8 is scheduled to make modifications to Boeing B-737 jets and use the Canada Scott Bull-Doer business. Both types are equipped with two jet engines that are needed to patrol large areas at high speed. It can fly up to 11-12 kilometers in the air, allowing reconnaissance not only by sea but also by inland areas. The basic performance required by the military is to satisfy both models. First flown in April 2009, the P-8A will use high-tech equipment to provide powerful submarine detection capability. The AN-10 radar onboard the P-V8 is assessed to provide good detection of small targets above the surface and the coast with complex terrain. Use a device to detect the exhaust fumes of conventional submarines instead of magnetic detectors (MADs) that detect the buzz emitted from steel submarines. This is a step considering the growing trend of making submarines to avoid magnetic detectors. Eleven antisubmarine weapons, including torpedoes, can be installed inside and outside the fuselage. Once loaded, one can fly 8300 kilometers for up to 10 hours with nine crew members on board. The U.S. Navy, which introduced about 50 planes by the beginning of this year, is planning to replace its P-3C maritime patrol aircraft with another 50 aircraft. The Indian Navy plans to introduce a total of 12 P-8-A units and has currently taken over eight. The Australian navy also took over four out of 12 ships. The British and Norwegian naval purchased nine to five ships each. It is a fantasy that Saab's Soph patrol aircraft is on patrol at sea. Saab is the first company to make a patrol aircraft at sea. Airline experts estimate the P-8`s provisional price to be 350 billion won and that of Sorfish to be 200 billion won. Sophish plans to make it possible for seven crew members to fly for up to 6,600 kilometers on board once it is fueled. It is said to be allowed to carry up to six torpedoes or anti-ship missiles outside the aircraft. As it plans to have an AESA radar equipped with a 360 degree surveillance capability, it can be used for naval combat, reconnaissance, special forces support, and long-range search and rescue operations. Saab is targeting the Korean market at low prices and under the exceptional condition of co-production with Korea. "" If the Korean government selects the patrol aircraft from Saab, more than half of the imported units can be co-produced in Korea, "" said Saab, adding, "" If we meet the demand for the patrol aircraft in Korea, we will meet the demand of 6 marine patrol aircraft in Korea. "" It is evaluated that the strategy was designed to take into consideration the needs of the sea police, who were involved in accidents due to the fact that the threat from North Korea's submarines continues and the geography surrounding the three sides of the sea.For Boeing and Saab, the next patrol aircraft project is a significant undertaking that can not be withdrawn.Kim Dae-jung, Roh Moo-hyun administration, f e - 737 early warning and control aircraft and F-15 fighter jets k, who dominated the Korean weapons market and sell the Boeing defense industry by the torrent of major United States and Europe.Saw a bitter taste in weapons programs. In September 2013, the F-15SE was selected for the next fighter jet (F-X) project, but was changed to the U.S. Lockheed Martin's F-35A by then Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin's ' political judgment '. In June 2015, he was also eliminated by European Airbus's A330 MRTT, reversing military expectations. All it did was to supply 36 AH-64E units, winning the Army's attack helicopter project in 2013.Under these circumstances, the next patrol aircraft project is a good opportunity for Boeing to recover its former status in the Korean arms market. Performance has been validated to some extent by the United States, India, Australia and Norway operating or deciding to introduce it. If Korea succeeds in winning a contract, it could affect U.S. allies who are considering introducing a patrol aircraft at sea.  P-82A Marine patrol aircraft cockpit is composed of digital instruments, which enhances pilot convenience and safety. U.S. Navy archivers are loading P-8`s patrol aircraft with torpedoes. Provide U.S. Navy Donald Trump at Cheong Wa Dae on August 7 last American president and Moon Jae-in attended by president of the Korea-U.S. summit meeting p of Eight in adopting the a positive results, too.Affect that, too. At the summit, the two leaders agreed to purchase multibillion-dollar U.S.-made weapons, including reconnaissance assets. The P-V8 A is not yet decided to be adopted as Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and is not the weapon that the United States is reluctant to sell, such as Joint Stars (JSTARS). Regarding the acquisition of Korea`s advanced strategic assets, U.S. Ambassador to Korea Mark Naffer said on July 9, "" What will be talked about is P-8 aircraft (P-8`s sea-shore patrol aircraft) and what can be said about is significant. "" Even for Saab, the next patrol aircraft project is considered to be the one that must be ordered. Korea is considered a market that uses a lot of U.S.-made weapons and is difficult for European defense contractors to penetrate. However, it has better access to the market than Southeast Asian countries with poor financial conditions, and even Japan and Taiwan, which insist on U.S.-made arms alone. The premium, which has been adopted as the main weapon on the Korean Peninsula, where high military tensions persist, would make it easier to sell weapons to other countries. A case in point is the selection of the same aircraft as the Korean Navy, which introduced the European AW-159 Marine Operation Helicopter. If the plane is sold to South Korea, it can expect to be sold further to Southeast Asian countries in conflict over the sovereignty of the South China Sea.It is also a good idea to imagine Saab's Swordfish Sea patrol aircraft detecting and chasing enemy submarines. Critics say the introduction of the Saab weapons is biased toward the United States, which is also a positive factor for Saab. Although the Korean military spent tens of thousands of won on expensive U.S. arms, it could not increase its military strength by developing its own weapons because core technology is not transferred properly. Meanwhile, European defense contractors were aggressive in transferring technology to the Korean market because they entered the market late. European weapons are also highly interoperable with U.S. soldiers because they are designed to meet NATO military standards, so they do not interfere in operational operations. That is why some point out that it is time to consider the development of defense science and technology and promotion of the domestic defense industry while maintaining the combined operational efficiency of the Korea-U.S. alliance.The Defense Acquisition Program Administration, which will lead the implementation of the next patrol aircraft on the sea, has set up a basic strategy by this month to finalize the specific project from the start of the defense project committee presided over by Defense Minister Song Young-moo at the beginning of the year. If the project is launched in earnest, the competition between Boeing and Saab over the next patrol aircraft project that will stop North Korean submarines from moving out of the sea is also expected to intensify.Park Soo-chan, reporter of the press at psc@segye.com"

[Untrusted reproduction and redistribution of news 1 Korea (news1.kr), Japanese researchers, stag beetles, and horned cicadas ' external bones were also covered in veils, which included an estimated principle (Seoul = Yonhap news agency). Nagoya University researchers reported recently that the folded pouched tissues in the head of a beetle were enlarged like a pupa, and the results of an online study conducted by researchers at the University of Nagoya announced in a Japanese newspaper. When a longicorn beetle passes into the pupa from the larva, it suddenly develops a large horn after only two hours of separation. It was discovered that the fluid at the head end of the larva flowed into the future horn, "" angular momentum, "" and was more than tripled at a time. It is known that this type of change is not possible to divide cells or move cells in a short time, so the process of creating the horns of a beetle has been a mystery to academics. The research team believes that external skeletons of insects such as deer, beetles, and horns could be created by the same pattern. A research team at Nagoya University's Kotō Hiroki team found that the shape of horns simply appeared when they injected fluid from the larvae of long insects. It was confirmed that when each muscle was inflated for a short period of time artificially, it would form horns. The team of scientists simulated wrinkles on each muscle group of insects measuring 5.4 ㎜, 8.2 ㎜, and 3.8 ㎜, from the long-established live beetle larvae before peeling. The triangular shape, which is 0.4 ㎜, was placed side by side to create the pocket-shaped "" virtual angular momentum "". The wrinkles on each of these energies were shaped like horns of a beetle. Goto says, "" I was surprised to see a complicated thing happening at the head end of a larva, "" and that with the simple physical process, the horns appeared to have been made up of other organisms with hard bones outside. "" Because the tissue, which is the source of the tissue, is folded in other parts of the body such as legs, it is estimated that these parts expand like airbags as the horns. lhy5018@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"On July 2, 1954, 230,000 people's petition against abortion was made public.A birth contrary to our mother ` s wishes will have the same unfortunate consequences for our mothers and their children. The mother's right to self-determination should be respected. State intervention also impairs their dignity and right to pursue happiness. "" It may sound like an essay written by a social-political progressive person, but in fact, it is Kim Ki-choon, a former presidential secretary of state. The book was written in a 1984 doctoral dissertation by former Seoul National University professor Kim, on criminal law revisions. We should be careful with the extended interpretation, but what is clear is that the pros and cons of artificial abortion (abortion) do not depend on progressive or conservative methods. So far, individual opinions on abortion differ depending on the circumstances, and the nation has also been divided on the social situation. The reason why former minister Kim supported abortion is because of the trend that the nation had implicitly allowed abortion while pursuing a birth control policy.Only when the official opinion is submitted as a petition by the people can the controversy be heated over whether abortion should be repealed. That is why 233,5327 people signed a petition to abolish abortion on July 30. The presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae has decided to make an official response to the petition if more than 200,000 people join it within a month. A senior presidential aide or justice minister in charge is expected to make an official comment on the abolition of abortion in at least three weeks. The abortion issue was discussed at a seminar titled Why Life Education Is Required by the National Assembly Life respect Forum on July 10. Cardinal Yeom Soo-jung, head of the Catholic Church in Seoul, harshly criticized the claim to legitimize abortion by some in society, saying abortion is a terrible violence and a form of murder.Immortalism is defined in Article 239 of the Criminal Code. Women who have aborted their pregnancy receive less than one year in jail or a fine of less than two million won, and health care workers who have illegally performed abortion receive less than two years in jail. The Act was established in 1953 and was opposed to the improvement of the social and economic status of women and the regulation of the population growth, but could not overcome the claims of sexual morality and the right to life of unborn children. Since the 1960s, the government has been working on birth control measures to create the Hat Health Act. The Act 1973 stipulated why abortion was allowed for eugenics, ethical, criminal, and medical reasons. In addition, the government tried to enact a revision to add social and economic reasons in 1976, to legitimize abortion by unmarried women in 1983, and to legitimize abortion by abortion by two children in 1985. Not all three attempts were made against public opinion. It is limited to the extent to which partial abortion allowances and attempts to expand the reasons for permit were not the result of women's calls for liberalisation, as in the West, but rather the byproduct of the ' population control policy ' of developed-led dictatorships.The Korea Women's Association for Abortion and Abortion of Abortion : "" The Battle Ground 269 "" was unveiled at the gallery on the first floor of Seoul's Women's Plaza on July 19.The Korea Women's Association for Abortion and Abortion of Abortion : "" The Battle Ground 269 "" was unveiled at the gallery on the first floor of Seoul's Women's Plaza on July 19.● About 100,000 abortions per year and 10 people punished for their abortions are found to be illegal, and the phenomenon of abortion crimes is clear. Abortions are carried out without knowing in reality, but few punishments. According to the 2011 National Research on Abortion of Abortion from Abortion by the Health and Welfare Ministry (targeted 4000 women aged between 15 and 44), the number of abortions in 2010 was estimated to be around 167,388. The number of cases decreased to 344,453 in 2005, 241,111 in 2008, and 187,798 in 2009, but the number of women who were pregnant decreased significantly. Based on the results, the number of abortions is estimated at 100,000.There are only a small fraction of abortions that are conducted legally. Last year, National Assembly Health and Welfare Committee Rep. Sung Il-jong received only 4,452 reports on the status of artificial abortions from the Korea Health Insurance Corp.. The official and legally defined abortion means five percent more than all abortions. The number of cases has decreased to 6020 in 2014 and 5485 in 2015. Only about 10 people are known to be punished for abortion."" It's not as easy as it is to assume that abortions are unknown to the outside world, but it does seem certain that they are decreasing, "" a ministry official said, adding that there are fewer women who are able to spread and have less recognition. The ministry plans to conduct a survey next year on the status of abortions.Those who insist on ending abortion, whether to become mothers or criminals, stress that the ban on abortion and the reduction of abortion rates (abortion rates per 1000 women who are pregnant) are irrelevant. In fact, the Netherlands has no legal limitations on abortion. However, after 13 weeks, it is only acceptable to authorized institutions. Netherlands had 10.1 abortion rates in 2008, far lower than Korea's 15.8 in 2010. Austria, Germany, and the United Nations have wide limits on abortion rates, but abortion rates are 1.2, 7.2 and 7.0, respectively. "" It is statistically proven that abortion prevents abortion, "" said the Korean Women's Health Team. "" To reduce abortion, it is important to strengthen the practice of contraception "".Some argue that women should be allowed to have abortions in order to respect their right to make decisions. The life of the unborn child is important, but so is the life and life of a female. Presidential Secretary for Civil Affairs, the Presidential Secretary for National Security, wrote in September 2013 in his paper, "" The religious, ethical, and philosophical principles of respect for unborn children are important, but the principles of respect for women are also important. "" "" The reasons for eugenic acceptance and criminal reasons should be re-configured to reality, and new reasons for socio-economic ones should be added, "" said the abortion proposal in the 12th week of pregnancy. "" I believe it is the woman's right to health that is important to have an abortion, "" said Jeong Hyun-bak, Minister of Gender Equality and Family, in a parliamentary audit on July 6. "" I believe that women are guaranteed to have health when they give birth to their children. ""Obstetrics and gynecologist are also generally in favor of abolishing abortion laws. Most of all, it is because of the rules on punishment for abortion. In reality, 100,000 abortions are performed in the shade, and if caught, the punishment structure does not match reality. An anonymia doctor, who requested anonymity, said, termination of an abortion does not pay. Rather, it is in the hospitals ` interest to let them give birth, said the patient, If only an unfortunate doctor is punished, all doctors would be reluctant to operate and have another side effect.● DO N'T FOLLOW LIFELOW THE BISES … Men should take legal responsibility for maintaining abortion, so no one can violate the right of the unborn child. In particular, it is not a confrontation between the right of women to make decisions and the right of the unborn child. Furthermore, he stresses that there is a contradiction in opening the doors themselves when abortion itself is not mentally or physically beneficial. Kim Hyun-chul, president of the Anti-abortion Movement, said, "" No one can say that women have to have their fingernails or have cosmetic surgery, but it's not because we are the only ones who can say that unborn children should have independent self-determination. ""In addition, they argued, "" We should not violate the principle of the balloon effect caused by the ban on abortion because of its side effects. "" He also raised questions about the fact that the man who caused the abortion to be punished is not included in the punishment. Cha Hee-je, chairman of the Pro-Life Association, said, "" I understand that this is a country that is immune from abortion now. I don't think it's clear that abortions are being carried out arbitrarily, and it's not yet to mention balloon effects at this stage.

"The extremist Islamic nation, which shocked the world with its dreadful politics and terror, was finally driven out of its occupation. On the 9th, in Al-Bukhamal, eastern Syria, the last outpost city, the black flag was dropped. Earlier in June, IS was forced out of Mosul, its largest base, and lost its ' capital ' Laksa last month. There is no place on the map that can be represented as IS territory anymore. But did you know that IS, who had posed as a nation for three years and five months, had its own currency? What happens to the money that's gone to the ruins of IS now. [New World News, Come to Know, More] is the story behind IS ' currency. The coins were distributed to the occupied territories by the Islamic nation of Dinar, whose gold unit was Dirham, whose silver coin was Dirham, and their fairy tales were Phil. The day of founding for the Nationally-owned Islamic nation (IS), which has taken control of the best oil fields, is June 29, 2014. As IS's host, Abu Bakhr al-BaddadI, declared setting up a caliphate in Iraq. IS originally set out to become the headquarters of radical Sunni armed groups al Qaeda, which carried out the September 11, 2001 attacks. After the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime, he began to grow in power in the sectarian northern part of the country, and expanded to the war-ravaged northern part of Syria. It's been three years and five months since the official death sentence was passed on November 9, 2017. And during that time, IS accomplished something that al Qaeda didn't. It wasn't just a terrorist identity ; it was a real territorial status. IS has set up its own administrative structure, schools, police stations and even courts. The Iraqi and Syrian border's "" best "" oil fields have been taken over, with disputes and civil wars causing a vacuum in governance. Changes in occupation areas of the Islamic country (IS), which declared itself a caliphate ; the areas identified in light color are as of January 5, 2015 and the country's dark color is as of October 30, 2015. The last base of IS Syria d'Arles Al-Beu Kamal fell on July 9, and now the IS territory is almost gone. [BBC Graphics Capture] And then IS issued its own currency. Control of money means control of the flow of the economy. IS forced residents to use coins they'd been using instead of its previous currency, the Syrian and Iraqi currency. This gives IS control of its wealth and economic activities. Think about the Japanese era. Shortly after the annexation, Japan accepted the former Bank of Korea and turned it into the Bank of Korea, making it the official currency of the land. Chosun Bank was manufactured by a factory run by the Chosun Governor's Office or a printing office of Jangseong General. The coins were of their own currency distributed by the Islamic nation (IS) to the occupied territories : the dinar, the silver dollar the dirham, and the fairy tales the Phil. Strangely, IS issued coins instead of paper money. It is made of pure gold, pure silver and pure copper unlike our usual coins. According to video clip released by IS in August 2015 via its own advertising medium, there are seven types of currency. The gold unit is Dinar, the silver coin is Dirham, and the fairy tale is Phil. The gold coins are divided into 1, 2, and 5 di na reu. IS claim that di reu na is 21 carats pure gold and weighs 4.25 g. At the time, when returned to the gold price, di reu is 139 dollars and approximately 160,000 won. The gold coin has a rather elaborate design that includes seven wheat ears and a world map from the Islamic holy book, the Koran. You must have gold to make gold coins. Local evidence suggests that when IS took control of Iraq's financial hub of Mosul in 2014, Mosul's central bank had a substantial amount of hard cash and bullion worth 450 million dollars. IS also raised imports by selling crude oil from the Alomar and Altanak oil fields, the "" black lifeline. "" We could produce 25,000 barrels a day and get a million dollars a day. "" The dollar is a paper fraud, "" Abu Bakhr Dubois, IS ' top leadership. Why gold? IS declares in a promotional video that the currency would destroy the U.S. dollar, which is just a piece of paper. The actual U.S. $ 100 is just a piece of paper with the value of a dollar. By comparison, IS gold coins were worth 160,000 won. IS insists in the video that the gold coin system will end fraud in the U.S. dollar and restore films from the Middle Ages Arab empire. Public relations video is loud, but it does not seem like this gold, silver or fairy tale was widely used in real life. The escaped IS soldiers testified they were paid in U.S. dollars. Experts estimate that if residents received the gold, they would rather keep it hidden than trade it. There must have been limits to how IS could create things that could be used in a daily life. Perhaps the Western corrupt currency system was designed to emphasize the days of pre-Contamination Arabic gold and attract followers. U.S. dollar image Last August, the Financial Times said, IS forced residents to use the money when the market was in its deep decline. They paid their own tax, their own telephone bill, their own registration fee. If you didn't have your own currency, you would have to pay a Syrian pound or a U.S. dollar for it, even if you didn't have it with you. All other daily transactions were ordered to be made in their own currency. Hey`s come in dark red, so I wonder why he took the dollar instead of his own currency. First, IS has profited from casting money by doing this. They made a profit by placing the value of their gold or silver coins above the international price of gold. The actual value of 1 di reu is 160,000 won but if I distribute it as the value of 200,000 won, the extra 40,000 won will be for IS. Local estimates indicate that IS earned several hundred thousand dollars by selling more than 100,000 gold coins. And IS got around to distributing its own currency, which is about to go down the drain, sucking in exchangeable U.S. dollars outside. The residents had to sell their dollar reserves to pay their taxes and buy IS currency. Even though IS called a piece of paper "" useless "" a "" corrupted deception, "" they also preferred the U.S. dollar as a safe asset. A image of the American dollar in heaps It is not clear how much money IS has stolen in this way. But you can imagine the full scale in the case of IS ' money operator Samer Idalis, who died in a military strike last June. The men reportedly had filled eight bags to the Syrian northwestern city of Sardhar in the 25-day period and embezzled as much as 10 million dollars. There is evidence that the money has continued to be transferred for several months. The money transfer and money laundering used mostly in the Middle East with Hawala, a traditional money exchange and remittance system. Hawala is a cash-trading network based on relationships with relatives, and it is said to use not only in the Middle East but also in Muslim communities in Europe. That means money flowed into Europe through hawalas. The report warns that such stolen funds could be used to support IS linkage mechanisms and to fund terrorism. Money goes around like this. - Hey IS funds, worries of European terrorism. - Alnuri, a mosque representative of Mosul's destroyed in an air raid last June. [Yonhap news agency] Oh, but what a ruined country's IS now? In fact, even when IS was in existence, the currency was only recognized inside the occupied territory, not outside of the country. In the future, I think we will most likely meet on auction markets such as eBay, which sells rare currency. And I started to think that according to a posting from August 2016, a Hungarian dealer said he was selling IS coins. Prices at the time were $ 20 per unit (about 23,000 won), a far cry from IS ’ s nominal value. The response to the posting is ' It doesn't seem to be real IS coins, ' ' One of them is that a lot of fake coins were made in Turkey. ' There's a distrust of IS ' currency management, and the money isn't worth it. What distinguishes money from paper is the belief in the issuing body, the state that manages it. The currency of the ruined country is therefore sad. The coins were distributed to the occupied territories by the Islamic nation of Dinar, whose gold unit was Dirham, whose silver coin was Dirham, and their fairy tales were Phil.

A family tree of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, who had to move from Queen Victoria's days when they were lonely boys. In the end, the two are descended from Queen Victoria. Prince Philip was born on June 10, 1921 in Gorfu, Greece. He was born to Andreas, who was the Prince of Greece and Prince of Denmark, and Princess Alice of the Battenberg family. No. 6. Prince Andreas, who was the fourth son of Georgios I of Greece, was succeeded to the throne by Constantinos, Prince Philip's uncle, after the assassination of George. Prince Philip's grandmother comes from the Romanov family, who was executed by the army during the Russian Revolution. And grandfather is king christian IX of Denmark. Like his wife Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip was also from the European royal family, but the start of their lives was quite opposite. "" Queen Elizabeth's family was all happy and happy together. "" The 1936 Abolishment of the late Prince Edward VIII by the Royal Family King Elizabeth was a failure in Britain (Except for the divorced American woman, Mrs. In Greece, a coup broke out in 1922 and Constantinos, the uncle of Prince Philip, was taken from the throne. Philip's father, who was in the army at the time, was also forced to defect for treason. The family lived in Paris for 10 years, but life was very difficult. Parents loved their son, but could not escape his anxious surroundings, and Prince Philip grew up with little or no sight of his parents ' faces as a child. Because of long years in exile, the mother had a nervous breakdown, and the brothers were often left at the door of friends and relatives. Alice had a nervous breakdown in 1931 and moved to Sanatrium, Switzerland, when the children came home in the evening, and the mother was in a miserable condition already gone. All four sisters had married German dignitaries and had settled down earlier, and my father had left for southern France. Prince Philip was already left out when he was 10. Prince Philip, in his mid-teens, was so roughly asked in an interview with The Independent, "" What language did the family speak in? What is it? "" in British newspaper. Hey...a cute picture of Prince Philip's childhood familiarist, with his father, mother and four mature older sisters who had to leave their loved ones behind. Far from seeing his mother from the summer of 32 to the spring of 37, Philip is said to have never received a letter. Later on, Prince Philip said, In short, Assumptions had collapsed. Mother was sick, older sisters were married and father went to southern France. I had to survive anyway by myself. We had no other choice. The only people who filled in for their parents and took care of Prince Philip are his mother's relatives, the Milford-Havens and Mountbattens. They were related to many European royal houses, including the British Royal Family. Prince Philip attended British school, attended German schools for about a year, and then returned to England to attend Scottish boarding school and prestigious Gordon Stown. And tragedy happens again. When Prince Philip was 16, his older sister Cecilia and her husband and two nephews were killed in an airplane accident. A few months later, her younger father, Sir George Moundtabatn, the guardian of Prince Philip, died of cancer at the young age of 46. Gordon Stoun, principal of the school's headquarters, told Philip then, "" (Philip) accepted his sorrow like a man. "" But one classmate repressed his feelings in The Independent. It was not until after her meeting with Queen Heile that she found the happiness of life at Westminster Abbey in London, 1947, that Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip were wedding pictures. After graduation, her father entered the Royal Navy as an enrollment to the British naval academy, Sir Louis Mount. There, the 18-year-old Army cadet, Prince Philip, met his cousin (both Prince Philip of Wales and Princess Elizabeth), the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth. Then seven years later, in 47, the two announced their engagement. It was a happy time to be in life, but lost many. Prince Philip's father died 44 years ago, and his mother was not sent back to Greece during the war when she met him in a dark refuge ; no one was married to Philip's wife at the Cathedral of the Jewish people during the Nazi occupation. The two will celebrate platinum wedding on November 20, the 70th anniversary of their marriage. Prince Philip did not find happiness until after his wedding. Some say she was out of step with Queen Elizabeth, but she was fascinated by Philip's "" honesty and independence. "" During his courtship, Prince Philip wrote his future fiance, Elizabeth, in the summer of 46. "" Winning the war, getting the opportunity to relax the body, and feeling love from the deepest part of the heart offset anything. The personal suffering, the global suffering, that I have experienced so far, is considered to be trivial. "" Last August, Prince Philip officially retired from all royal jobs. His 70 years of loyal service to the Queen and unwavering support for the British royal family was his belief in his country, his consideration for his country, and his success in overcoming all the hardships and hardship he experienced during his upbringing.

"The prosecution failed to deal with the case after 12 years of jail sentence. Unlike the public sentiment that the criminal offenders face uneasy about the dangers of retaking their crimes before their crimes, Cho Doo-soon's early release is scheduled because of loose application of the law, abandonment of the appeal, and the court's decision to take care of him. According to legal circles on July 11, the prosecution did not impose a criminal law on victims of sexual violence (rape, rape, and rape) in 2009 when it indicted Cho. The special law on sexual violence is supposed to penalize students with weapons or jail terms of more than seven years in jail, but the prosecution chose a criminal law that punishes offenders with weapons or with more than five years in jail. The reason why prosecutors applied the law was not easily understood was revealed in their audit of the national affairs in 2009. The Special Law on Sexual Violence was revised in June 2008 and added to the sentence for rape and rape of minors under 13 years old. As the prosecution indicted Cho, it failed to recognize this and committed a previous criminal offence. Even though the prosecution made a wrong application of the law, it could have been corrected by changing the indictment during the trial. However, the prosecution did not even try. When Cho actively denied the charges, it is possible he focused on proving his guilt and overlooked changing the indictment. The court sentenced Cho Doo-soon to 12 years in jail. The indicted prosecutor had an opinion on life imprisonment, but the judge's trial gave up the appeal in accordance with the criteria for appeal within the prosecution. Though the sentence of 12 years in jail is considered to be unusual for rape offenders, many say the prosecution should have engaged in more arguments in an appeal. The court judged that Cho committed the crime while he was drunk and weak in mind and body, but added to the sentence, Cho would face a lesser sentence. Prosecutors say they have ample room to argue the case in the second trial. As the prosecution gave up its appeal, however, the court and the Supreme Court were unable to issue a sentence that was higher than the sentence of 12 years in jail, which was handed down by the first trial. It is also regrettable that the court ordered the attachment of an electronic anklet along with 12 years of jail time and the disclosure of personal information that would isolate Cho from society. Prosecutors and the court failed to seriously consider taking care of the treatment and custody of the victims, even though it is very possible for them to commit the crime again after they were released from prison, including rape and rape. The prosecution was passive in requesting treatment and custody as the criminal code pointed out that the protection agencies were the ones who ordered double punishments, and the courts apparently were in the same position. We are applying the special law on child sex crimes after the incident of Cho Doo-soon, and actively seeking an appeal to allow offenders to take legal action, prosecution officials said. More than 430,000 people have agreed to the petition, which was posted on the presidential office`s public petition board, called Cho Doo-soon's re-examination as a life sentence. ▶ hyun@yna.co.kr driver information and contact (Click!) the latest fashion trend area, all (Click!) questioning Park Geun-hye, former president of the public prosecutor's office, the 13th, former director ibyeonggi seems compressed.Ibyeongho (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) former NIS chiefs Im Heon-Jung recorded special activity costs for Park Geun-hye, former president of the Journalist : the National Intelligence Service allegedly routinely pays patrolmen to the former director of Korea's NIS was ibyeongho.To show up as a suspect in 10 days in Seocho-gu, Seoul, Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office.The former top-ranking intelligence officials when Gen.

At a giddy moment, Inspector Roh took the opposite road. `` It was the most difficult decision I've ever made throughout my career, '' he said. Among the five Cyka drivers in charge of security, the three who went to cover their tracks were completely exposed to water bottles and light bars. The quick judgment of the scene prevented "" disgrace to the nation. "" It was confirmed that the Presidential Security Service issued the same order at the time.Whose son “Let me take care of it is close security.” Trump the president cheerfully after a schedule could leave the country, with every fiber of his body through the front of the ‘a hidden hero of the site’.Police motorcycle unit was. Their official name is the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's Traffic Patrol.

Even these people are inspected and searched thoroughly by using metal detectors. Nevertheless, eruptive conditions may occur at any time during transport. About 30 Cyka, a member of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency's traffic patrol team, was in charge of guarding and responding to the vehicles. They also start their way on the front line and throw themselves to block protesters when suspicious vehicles or demonstrators appear. More than half of the members of the team are veterans who have been on the cycar for more than 10 years, but this is why they often see people who died on the job.Large cycas with an displacement of 1200 to 1700 cc serve as the protocol themselves for getting bigger and moving. The ' seagull ' line is a symbol of the group. Severe training is needed to carry out tasks such as traffic control while maintaining a large size. We need to be able to skate freely to use ice hockey, said Chang Jung-jin, director of traffic patrol at Cicar 2. The license is very difficult to operate because you need to master the job well.Their role becomes more important when they visit remote areas by land. It is because the government should control traffic in the right place at the right time to avoid having to stop the vehicles even for a moment. Hundreds of possible paths should be memorized in advance. Although failure is not an acceptable task, I worked with pride to end the event and keep the nation safe, Chang said.As a result, the government should provide more effective measures to protect the people's livelihood. Even though reports of violent crimes are received, it is not easy for regular police vehicles to arrive at the scene in time, breaking through the identity of the police. It is time for Siika to be able to travel between the lane and the car freely. Namdaemun station traffic patrol 10 a month by decree, the police threatened to engulf at the request of the first to arrive at the scene.When they see emergency patients on the job, they can even control the road ahead of them. In March, a 120-day old baby suffering from fever and vomiting saved her life because of Sika, a citizen who complained of breathing problems and heart pain in June. Even when transferring the heart to the hospital from Gimpo Airport to use for heart transplant operations, doctors often ask for support from the cycar, which is faster than an ambulance. At this time, they run with a ' life given ' mentality. Although I feel accomplished when I finish the national guard safely, I feel more satisfaction when saving a human life, Chang laughed.I run for my life ... 60000 won a day's work allowance, and the durability of a police motorcycle, is set at 7 years ' risk. However, traffic patrols are lined with cars that are more than 10 years old. If there is any problem with old machine parts while working at high speed, the lives of police officers are at risk.One policeman at the Pikah Unit said, "" Unlike the police station we keep on when the motorcycle breaks down, you should not ride daily to do your work. "" "" It's a dead end when you put the budget on hold. ""Poor safety equipment is a big problem. Cyka troops must stop running on the highway and take directions, but their survival helmets are the same as regular traffic cops. A high-performance safety suit that protects the entire body is the sense of unconsciousness. This is why the injuries of soldiers continue to rise.There are also many comments about too low a pay. They only get a monthly allowance of 60,000 won. As the police is classified as a traffic policeman, the amount of work allowance is 200,000 won, the lowest level among police officers. Because of this, many police officers avoid cyber soldiers.We were concerned that the agency might not have to raise the duty if it avoids working as a cyber guard in the cyber guard, although the situation is not much better, said one local police officer.Seongsuyeong reporter.com syoung@hankyung.com[ [Glang] [Mobile Hankyung.com] [Mobile Police subscription application] ⓒ hanguk A woman who illegally copied and distributed the body was found by a newspaperman, Rep.The body of A (47, female) was found in a cave in Naebuk-myeon, Boeun-gun, Chungbuk at around 3:00 p.m. on July 11.It is estimated that the body was severely damaged and partly corrupted when it was discovered, and that it died sometime on July 2.Police are investigating whether the man, 65, who had an affair with the woman, murdered A person for money and was quoted as having done so.Police began investigating the disappearance of a restaurant owner run by A on July 5.A CCTV near the house of a relative in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, detected the two returned home alone on July 2.Police in the Cheongju Sangdang area, which received a report of his disappearance, conducted an investigation on July 6 to find a witness against the suspect.B was quoted as saying in a statement to the interrogation of a witness, I don`t know where I went after arguing with Mr. A.

"Suriyu 10, Suryu 4,200 tons of water detection and detection are the most capable of operating at sea for two weeks under an excellent 650 meters. Foreign media outlets of IHS Janes 360 and Diplomat announced on July 6 that Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) of Japan launched a small-flow diesel submarine, Suriyu, with an underwater displacement of 4,200 tons. The Shuriyu ship is scheduled to go into service in 2019, the 10th ship of the Soryu class and the fifth one to be built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The submarine can operate underwater for two weeks without being seen above water, equipped with an air system, which began construction in 2015. The small class submarine was upgraded to an Oyashio class submarine and was 84 meters long and 9.1 meters wide, equipped with an AIP system and a large functional cow. The wind increased the weight by 1,300 tons. Japan has licensed AIP with the approval of Kokumsa, Sweden. A small rail-class submarine operated by two powerful Kawasaki ' 12 V25SB ' diesel engines can produce a speed of 13 knots (24 km) under water and 20 knots (37 km underwater) under water. Churiyu is a small class diesel submarine launched by Kawasaki Heavy Industries of Japan. It is also equipped with a cigar-shaped, anti-destructive hull with limited stealth castles and a Z.Q.-7 sonar capable of detecting enemy vessels 70 kilometers away. The class had six ' HU - 606 ' 533 ㎜ torpedo launcher, which launched an 89 type heavy torpedo. With the torpedo tube, the company can also launch an UGM-64 gun missile, capable of striking an enemy ship, 140 kilometers away, with a high width warhead. The submarine is estimated to have a strong long-range strike capability with about 30 heavy torpedoes and Hapon missiles.Japan's mini-level submarine [Wikimedia Supply] is scheduled to build and operate a total of 12 small-flow submarines by 2021 through Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. As planned, the Maritime Self-Defense Forces launched its ninth small-flow class submarine, Seiryu, in October last year. The Seryu ship will go into commission next year. Foreign news agencies reported that Japan is currently operating 17 conventional submarines, including the small class, Oyashio class, and Harushio class (3,200 tons underwater). Military experts say that although Japan's submarines are inferior in number to China, Russia, and North Korea, they are capable of making noise at the highest level, and in particular, of hiding to 500 meters, with special steel plates for submarines called the NS100. ▶ shkim@yna.co.kr driver information and contact (Click!) the latest fashion trend area, all (Click!)

There are many meetings where riders start or finish. Four men who brought their bikes here shared two bottles of rice wine and a can of beer in front of a convenience store. As soon as they drank, they immediately returned to their bikes and left. Bike drivers can drink day and night. Four of the seven tables in front of the store were also occupied by the drunk and electric vehicle owners around 3:00 p.m. on July 29. Three cans of beer (500mL) were placed in front of two drivers who were believed to be in their 30s. An aunt who went for a walk with her son (3) said, "" I don't want my baby to run into a drinking bicycle, so I hold my hands when I pass by it. ""A drunk bicycle running day and night threatens pedestrians and vehicles. Even with the increasing number of bicycle safety accidents, there is no crackdown on drinking and riding. Bike drinking and driving is clearly illegal. The road traffic law says that people should not ride a bicycle while intoxicated. However, the problem is that there are no punitive provisions. There is no reason to punish police officers for discovering drunk bicycles on the spot. In developed countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, where bicycle drivers are heavily engaged in drinking and driving, they can impose fines and can even cancel their driver's licenses if found.Experts say the problem is the consciousness of drivers who are indifferent to drinking and riding. In fact, many bicycle drivers do not consider drunk driving dangerous. "" It is very refreshing to have a small beer when you are born with a bicycle, "" said Jung (28), a bike club worker for the fifth year.

Chung, who was going to return around 11:00 p.m., did not get a taxi for more than 30 minutes. Jeong saw Tareung-ri station in front of Noksapyeong station and shouted for joy.

"The Egyptian scientist, 19 m long, found mysterious empty spaces using the Muon particles - inside Tusimuon chamber, inside the chamber, inside of a stone that is heavier than electrons - "" penetration is possible up to several hundred meters into the chamber. Particles physicists have discovered an empty chamber connecting the Queen's room and the King's room inside Egypt's Pyramid. The area where the muon, one of the basic particles of matter, is detected more than others was designated as an empty space without rocks blocking particles.A huge secret place was discovered in the Great Pyramid of Egypt, which was built 4,500 years ago. The excavators were not as darky-colored as Indiana Jones in the film. They were particle physicists with high-tech equipment wearing white anti-seismic clothing. Scientists from Japan, France and Egypt have been following the fact that "" muon particles from outer space have not yet been identified as being passed through the pyramids "" in the International Journal of Scientific Research on July 2. Why did physicists find space particles in the pyramids?◇ Principle such as seeing the inside of a human body in X-ray Great Pyramid is the grave of Egyptian pharaohs (kings) Kufu, who ruled 2509-2483 before the beginning of the year. With the height of 147 meters and the width of 230 meters, the Great Pyramid was named the Great. Inside the pyramid are three rooms. It is the room of the king in the basement, the Queen's room in the middle of the pyramid, and the King's room above it. The Queen's Room and the King's Room are lined with an eight-meter-high and two-meter-wide tournament room, which is 47 meters wide. Muslims, who conquered Egypt in the 9th century, first broke through the pyramid wall and in the 19th century, structures inside what is now known as pyramids were excavated.Researchers say they have discovered a new 30-meter empty space just above the competition. Ancient Egyptians built pyramids by constructing 2.3 million limestone blocks that weighed up to 15 tons. It is difficult to remove huge blocks of stone and can not be dug out with a bomb like in the past. Professor Luis Alberlez of UC Berkeley, U.S., who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1968, conducted a study by examining the inside of King Kapre's Pyramid next to the Kufu pyramid with muon particles. Kapre is the son of King Kufu.Looking inside the pyramid with a muon particle is the same principle as looking inside the body with an X-ray, explained Kim Soo-bong, a professor of physical astronomy at Seoul National University.In space, strong radiation, or spaceships, is poured out. When a spacecraft hits the atoms in the Earth's atmosphere, the elementary particles that make up the material appear. Muon is one of them. Muon passes through material like electrons. Still, the inside of the dense stone can pass by several hundred meters because it is 207 times heavier than the former. Another way to prevent the penetrating muon is to put a laboratory in an underground cave under the mountain in search of unknown particles.Professor Kim Soo-bong said, If there is a lot of music detected inside the pyramid, it could be empty or low-density, the only place that has a low density is the stone. Scientists are already watching with a muon look at the inside of volcanoes and inaccessible places like Fukushima nuclear plant accidents.Scientists from Japan, France and Egypt started a project called Scanpyramid in 2015 to view the inside of the pyramid with muon. Researchers at Nagoya University's Morishima Kunihiro installed a muon detector with a solution similar to film developer in the Queen's room in December 2015. A detector picture showing the density of the muon was found to have a large amount of muon detected, such as in the corridor.The findings of the Nagoya University were verified by two different researchers. Scientists at the Japan High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) installed a detector that glows when the Queen's room was passing by, and obtained the same result. Scientists at the French Institute of Nuclear Research installed a gas detector outside the pyramid to make way for empty spaces found by Japanese scientists. As the muon passes through the detector, the gaseous particle becomes electrically charged and can be detected. It was also the same result as the two Japanese researchers.◇ Empty spaces could be used for load distribution. Then, why did the ancient Egyptians make such a large empty space inside the pyramid? Some suggest that it was the real tomb of King Kufu. Neither the 9th nor 19th century excavations saw Kufu's mummy nor treasures.However, most archaeologists are refusing to take the charge of a secret grave or treasure house. As the tomb steles were found in the king's room, mummies or treasures should have been stolen. Instead, allegations are growing that it created empty spaces to reduce the load on the main corridor. In fact, the king's room in King Kufu's Pyramid consists of a structure consisting of stones stacked sideways, with a load of stone on top that reduces the pressure on top.Scientists plan to explore the empty spaces found in King Kufu's Pyramid by cutting a tiny hole and inserting a microscopic flying robot inside. At the same time, studies will be conducted to better understand the appearance of empty space by increasing the accuracy of muon detection. This is not the first time for science and archeology to meet. The infrared and laser images taken from space and the air were used to locate ancient historical sites. Indiana Jones, the science keyboard, may come out in the near future. ywlee@chosun.com][It is considered a technology that goes beyond the limits of screen size, and competition is fierce among businesses.This is a reporter from Kim Se - gyng.◀ Report ▶ The screen dries like a scroll and then unfolds.

"Tax hikes due to the highest level of elasticity in tax since the financial crisis … "" As the possibility of underproduction in the tax revenue budget increased by the most, last year's tax revenue reached an all-time high of 24 trillion won. Tax increase is divided by the current growth rate (economic growth rate considering inflation). One elasticity of tax means more tax than the growth of the economy, and one higher than that means more tax than the growth of the economy. As such, the national savings bank situation has become slim and the government's coffers are filled. According to the National Assembly's Strategy and Finance Committee's report on the 2018 budget review, last year's national tax revenue rose 11.3 percent year-on-year to 242.6 trillion won. Considering that the real growth rate of the current economy (real GDP deflator) was 4.7 percent last year, the elasticity of tax was estimated at 2.42. It is the highest level in the past decade. Tax elasticity value exceeded 2 by 2.12 in 2007, right before the global financial crisis, but was negative (- 0.39) in 2009 after falling to 0.62. It rose to 0.81 in 2010, 1.55 in 2011, and 1.65 in 2012, but was negative again in 2013, before showing a growth rate of 0.45 in 2014. As tax boom groups appeared, the elasticity of tax rose from 1.15 in 2015 to 2.42 in 2016. The record rate of elasticity in tax last year was attributed to a reduction of 24.7 trillion won in imports from last year and a 9 trillion won decline in last year`s supplementary budget. The government explained that the tax revenue rose due to factors such as improving corporate earnings, boosting consumption and boosting the real estate market.The tax hike is expected to continue from this year to next. According to the tax revenue package submitted to the National Assembly, next year's national tax revenue is 268.2 trillion won, 6.8 percent up from 251.1 trillion won earned by this year`s supplementary budget. Considering that the government's forecast for the current growth of the Korean economy is 4.5 percent next year, the elasticity of tax revenue is forecast to be 1.5 percent, the middle level of the elasticity of tax revenue over the past two years. However, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) said, "" Since the final tax revenue this year is expected to reach 260 trillion won ($ 268.2 billion), more than the standard for a supplementary budget bill, it is highly likely that next year's revenue budget ($ 268.2 billion) will have been underplassed. "" Assuming that the tax income is 260 trillion won, the tax revenue increase for next year will be a mere 3 percent, resulting in only a 0.67 percent increase in tax revenues. Given that the forecast for the current growth rate for next year is 4.5 percent and the elasticity of tax revenue in the past two years has exceeded 1, it is possible that the 2018 National Tax Service tax revenue will have been slightly underposed this year. ▶ pdhis959@yna.co.kr driver information and contact (Click!) the latest fashion trend area, all (Click!) divided we expressed regret at the dinner five times … 靑 北 problem will of resolution can't show me.It was inconvenient ""Ilsan → Yongsan diversions in fog ..."" accommodation ""three or four times in the staff recommendation"" returning to the tense standoff ""strong 文 an official failed president, chulbalseo to 124 minutes.

"The National Tax Service earned 18 billion won more in tax revenues from January to September this year when it passed the National Assembly to revise the highest tax rate law on income taxes since most of them were allocated in the last year. The tax payment of corporate tax, income tax, and VAT, the three most favored taxes, increased by 3-7 trillion won each.The Strategy and Finance Ministry announced its monthly financial trends yesterday. Tax revenues in the first nine months of this year were 207.1 trillion won, up 9.5 percent (18 trillion won) from 189.1 trillion won in the previous year. In the tax revenue target for the year, the "" tax rate, "" or the actual rate of taxes collected in the January-September period, rose by 82.5 percent from the same period last year. That means the tax is being collected faster than last year.When taking into consideration national tax revenues from January to September this year, corporate taxes rose by the largest margin to 7.1 trillion won. The net profit of 46.9 trillion won was cut last year from January to September, but it was 54 trillion won during the same period this year. Income tax and VAT were also lowered by 4.5 trillion won and 3.1 trillion won from the same period last year.Regarding this year`s tax revenue exceeding last year`s levels, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Dong-yeon told the special parliamentary budget committee on July 6 that it would not exceed 20 trillion won, or 17 trillion won + α (α).The government expects the total amount of national taxes to increase from 242.6 trillion won last year to 251.1 trillion won this year and 268.2 trillion won next year. If the revision of the tax law to raise the maximum tax rate on income and corporate taxes passes the National Assembly before the end of this year, the amount of national tax revenues could increase further. The U.S. is advised to use Korea's firm stance to reassure the agricultural and livestock industries. The government reiterated in a hearing on July 10 when farmers ` groups protested the deal, saying, There is no opening to the agricultural and livestock market. Trade Minister Kang Seong-cheon reiterated the government's position to industry officials who occupied the podium. Nevertheless, industry watchers called for the abolition of the Korea-U.S. FTA and refused to back down, and the hearing ended in a stalemate. As the government judged that it has performed its duty to hold public hearings as prescribed under the Trade Procedure Act, it decided to proceed with follow-up procedures to revise the Korea-U.S. FTA, including reporting to the National Assembly. However, such a backlash from the agricultural and livestock industries is expected to put a heavy burden on the Korean government in the upcoming round of negotiations to revise the Korea-U.S. FTA. "" The United States is extremely well aware of the situation in which we must defend the agricultural sector, "" a trade official said on July 11, "" to prepare for this point and to achieve this goal in other manufacturing negotiations. "" As the U.S. touches on Korea's most painful agricultural sector, such as automobiles and services, it could make excessive demands. In fact, the U.S. reportedly requested last September at the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Commission to immediately remove tariffs on U.S. agricultural products from Korea. The Korean government secured a 15-year-long deadline for abolishing sensitive items such as rice, garlic, onions and other 118 items when it signed the deal. The U.S. reportedly demanded the immediate elimination of agricultural tariff on agricultural products that were supposed to be eliminated over 15 years after the ratification of the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA), and decided to impose five to ten more years on Korean agricultural products. Korea`s trade minister Kim Hyun-chong told the National Assembly during a recent parliamentary audit, Agriculture Minister Kim Hyun-chong told the United States, We have no choice but to deal with what is most sensitive in the United States when agriculture comes into contact. However, as the nation is more desperate to protect the agricultural sector, the trade community is more likely to see a "" safe hand at agriculture "" and "" give up something else "" in the negotiation process. Agriculture Minister Kim Young-rok yesterday responded aggressively to the U.S. request for agricultural sector during a parliamentary special budget review committee meeting. Meanwhile, the government is reportedly planning to finalize preparations for the revision negotiation process by this month, including reports to the National Assembly. If the U.S. decides to move toward some revisions rather than a full revision, the two sides can start negotiations on the revision as early as next month.cool@yna.co.kr Regarding this sensitive argument, the British judiciary once again raised their hand for the driver, not the Uber. The London Employment Tribunal for the Republic of Britain's Employment Service found on July 10 (local time) that two men, James Farra and Yassin Aklam, were to blame for the protection of the "" safe drivers "". James Farah and others sued the Uber Company for classifying it as self-employed and denying it to basic protection by employees, and won last year's employment tribunal. Woober appealed, but the appeals court made the same decision. Urer said, "" We will appeal to the Supreme Court immediately after the ruling. "" The appeals court ruling means Uber faces another major business setback in Britain, the second largest market after the United States, the New York Times said.James Farah (left), who won an appeal against Uber, and Yassin Aslam [AFP = Union News], NYT said, "" This judgment has meant Wuber should not have to provide an official wage and pay down payment to drivers in the U.K., "" adding, "" a paid vacation package. "" Uber argues, "" New technologies and ideas can increase the flexibility of employment, "" and critics say that they should be self-employed people who sell on their own, but they say they should be free of charge. However, the court's ruling has raised the possibility that Wuber will face similar cases in other areas. "" They may be hiding behind technology, "" Adlam told an interview shortly after the verdict, "" but the law exists and they are bound to obey and respect, "" and "" the judgment of the million-man people on this planet is going to have to impact. "" Britain's taxi service has been in charge of the nation's taxi service for centuries since Uber entered the British market in 2012, and the city of Black Tak criticized Uber for running illegally, avoiding the regulations of authorities. When it comes to black tack, knights must pass a rigorous test to memorize tens of thousands of streets and landmarks called ' Buckles. ' London city traffic authorities earlier decided to suspend Wuber's operations in September. Currently, Wuber can continue to operate in London until a final decision is made after an objection is received ; however, Uber may be forced to leave London if the final decision is made. kn0209@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"Powered by neuronograph (AI chip) - acting like a neuronic ... After implementing 3D face-aware, the first thought of neuro-networking devices (NPU) developed during the first processing of a lightning core (NPU), which overcame the limits and drew attention. ENIAC was a huge machine with 19,000 vacuum tubes installed at 5.5 meters high and 245 meters long, and weighed 30 tons. The machines were called bullet machines, as they were able to solve the ballistic calculation in three seconds, which could take seven hours to solve. Today, smartphones smaller than the palm of one's hand can do many things faster than the sum of thousands of Eniacs. Thanks to fierce competition from scientists and businesses around the world to make the better-performing semiconductors smaller.However, the rules of competition are changing. Global IT companies are developing completely new anti-computer chips as the performance improvement of traditional methods is at its limit. An era is underway for AI chips, an idea derived from the human brain that can process a great deal of information at the same time, namely, the Neuro-Character Network. U.S. companies Apple, Google, Envidia-Intel-MDS, Korea Samsung Electronics and China Whaway all launched the development of AI chips and are in the process of producing them."" Intel needed $ 335 billion in intelligent, central processing equipment (CPUs) to load into personal computers, and opened up today's virtual semiconductor market with $ 375 billion (intelligent, approximately 375 trillion won). ""◇ Existing semiconductors processed as cores one at a time = An AP (Mobile Central Processing Device) is calculating the brain of an AI chip PC that processes a lot of information at once like the human brain. It is like an office where only one of its employees (the core) carries an abacus. As the ability of employees increases, computers and smartphones can process faster the performance of cores as can the performance of tasks.As the speed of the cores became limited, semiconductor companies created a ' multi-core processor. ' It meant that the CPU or AP would divide the calculations into several cores, such as an increase in the number of employees who do the calculations. Recent CPUs for PCs contain 2 to 18 cores. Some of Intel's semiconductor chips have 72 cores. The problem is that there are limits to the multi-core processor to handle emerging services such as voice recognition and image recognition. Samsung's voice secretary Bi xby and Apple Shri need 1000 times the amount of smartphones A.A. production to ensure complete processing of voice commands. Because the amount of data needed to analyze voice and find appropriate answers is beyond imagination. Because of this, smartphone makers are now adopting the method of sending the voice input into smartphones to the virtual space server (cloud) to find the answer and send it back to smartphones. That is why AI secretaries take time to understand people.At the European's largest IT exhibition, IFA12007, Berlin, Germany, last September, Whaway's CEO Richard Yoo announces the AP Kirin 970 with Neural Network Processor (NPU). / EPA Yonhap News Agency (NPU), a AI chip that has been introduced to address this issue, is the Neural Processing Unit (NPU). NPU got the idea from the neural network that makes up the human brain. Humans process and respond to a great deal of information simultaneously that is recognized by the five senses. This is possible not because the human brain is moving with one particular processing device but because many neurons (neurons) operate simultaneously. NPU has many cores like a neuron in a person's brain. At least a few dozen or more cores run simultaneously.Kang Seong-won, director of the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute's Intelligent Semiconductor Research Division, said, "" NPU is able to make the most of its sub-massive calculations, such as voice or picture, in order to make the most of its data processing and analysis function, and to optimize the current data points. "" If data is omitted, semiconductor chips are constructed simply, while speeding and dramatically reducing their consumption. NPU, however, which calculates from its approximate value, does not produce a complete calculation. "" The more people who can answer the survey with a clear answer, the more accurate it is that the poll results are than the precise information for AI services or voice and image recognition. ""Virtual image of AI chip ' Roig ' being developed by Intel. Reproduces the human neuron and the synapse structure. / Intel ◇ Global Enterprise Competitiveness Startups need to be fully equipped with AI chips, which were launched two or three years ago by global IT companies after the launch of the fourth industrial revolution such as artificial intelligence. As Intel controlled the era of the CPU, the NPU-leader company is forecast to lead the future industry over the next few decades.China Huawei unveiled the world`s first Mobile NPU, in70, at Europe's largest IT exhibition in September. The 970 giraffe was on Hwaway's latest premium smartphone, Mate 10, which was released on July 16. Apple also launched its latest smartphone, the iPhone 8 and the iPhone X, with the new Style Engine, AP, A11 Bionic. The Neurel engine has created a 3-dimensional face ID, a 3-dimensional face recognition feature that divides the user's face into 30,000 zones. It is also expected to utilize the Neurel engine for AR related function developed by Apple. Samsung Electronics is reportedly conducting research to install AI chips in the Galaxy S9 Series, which will be released next year. Samsung Electronics has invested a large amount of money in British chip technology companies Grapcore and Dipitech, China.Intel Corp., the leading maker of existing semiconductor technologies, also voted to enter the market. Intel announced late last month that it was developing a ' LoihI ' AI chip that mimicked ' neuron ' and ' synapse '. Intel said, "" Rohey is made up of 130,000 neurons and 130 million synapse, if you are human beings. ""As AI chips are widely used, there is a challenge to be solved.

"A car driver was killed by a car when he was hit by a bolt from the blue by a car and his car was hit by a bolt from the blue. Police, they searched for a warrant from a trailer driver in Chungju. The Chungju Police Station announced on July 11 that it booked Lee on suspicion of violating the traffic accident exemption law and was investigating. Lee stopped the trailer at 8:18 a.m. on an incline in Geumreung-dong, Chungju City, and when he got off, a passenger truck driver, identified as Hwang, rolled over about 300 meters, was waiting for a signal at an intersection. The accident happened on the busy way to work, almost leading to a major disaster. The accident happened in a flash when the driver stepped out of the trailer to see if the items were loaded properly. Shortly after he got off, the trailer on the steep slope, which was about 10 degrees, began to roll over and race down the road like a motorcycle. The trailer that Lee ran before he could get on, crossed the center line directly and passed five cars that were running, but it was waiting for the car to arrive at an intersection 300 meters below. He then dragged the carnival for another 15 meters and finally stopped when he reached the end of the road. What happened in just 10 seconds was that drivers, who were passing through the area on abrupt trailer journeys, fled from their chests after fleeing the crisis with a sudden stop. In a police investigation, Lee reportedly stated, I normally filled the side brakes and got out of the car. Police also secured a statement from witnesses at the scene of the accident that the gear lever was in neutral. Based on Lee`s statement, police will ask the National Institute of Scientific Investigation to identify the digital-run recorder (DTG) and the EDRs equipped with Lee`s trailer. DTG is a device that records vehicle operating information and stores in seconds various vehicle operating data, including vehicle speed and revolutions per minute (RPM), brake application records, position information, and driving time.EDRs are also devices whose data are recorded in 0.5 seconds before an accident, such as the driver's accelerator pedal, rpm speed, etc. Police also confirmed whether the accident was related to the black box surrounding the accident by collecting footage of Lee's arrival and departure from the passenger seat after stopping the trailer. Since experts say trailers can not move when the brakes are fastened, we will determine the cause of the accident based on a thorough examination of international experts and an analysis of the circumstances at the time of the accident, police said. vodcast@yna.co.kr and inquiry by reporting (click!) ▶ As the latest trends continue to gather (click!) - Dubai oil prices have continued to rise due to political unrest in the Middle East … Price of gasoline has soared by more than 1,500 won per liter for the past four months.
