That's not the case at all. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > First of all, he is not a very big dog, and can he not explain his tendency with his weight? ♫ Kang Hyung-wook > Sure. Because almost every dog I'm asked to do because I'm an aggressive dog has a much larger percentage of my tiny friends. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Really? ◆ Kang Hyeong-wook : I don't think it is a good idea to make the characteristics of a dog's stem species so limited by its size. This is not possible ... "" Aigo is the word I made without even knowing a dog. Are you making it without even knowing Kim Hyeon-jung? However, people told me a lot about dogs and cattle breeding because there were so many accidents between them. And I'm sure a lot of you think it might be that way. ^ Kang Hyeong-wook > If it is hard for a dog to touch me and even I feel fear, I should do it. The other one was aggressive and aggressive, so shouldn't education improve? But walking, smelling, pee, going to bed, and then going out for these activities are necessary. Training specialist Kang Hyung-wook. (Photo = JTBC ' Ssulzuk ') ◆ Kang Hyung-wook > Sure. There are so many dogs that can get along without wearing a muzzle. Actually, we know. Now, it is too much to ask all dogs to wear a muzzle size of 15kg or more. It didn't start by thinking about dogs as friends and wanting to live with animals, but by wanting it to be disgusting and not harming us. I think it was invented by someone who had never lived with them before, and who had never known them before. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > ` You have come up with a very easy plan `. Just block them all out in a very simple way?^ Kang Hyung-wook > Yes, it is. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > The other side may say this. If a dog bites you to death, then something must be done to solve the problem, and that is the last resort. Now, if you had to tell us something about a brilliant plan, what would it be? In my case, there is a pet registration system first. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Residential Registration System? You can also record whether you get rabies once a year while doing this. And while doing this, we can record and know dangerous dogs and good dogs that live well. And if your dog bites someone, you can hold that person accountable. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Heavy, then? Sure, you should bite them very hard. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > very heavy. Mr Kang : It is very heavy. And the other thing is, I want you to have a really strong responsibility when you have a dog. Even our friends are not averse to biting the fine or the warning of rude and disorderly people. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Incalize punishment on those who have a dog but can not afford it, and encourage them to do so. You say I agree. ^ Kang Hyeong-wook > 50,000 won, 70,000 won and 100,000 won, but the price should be increased to 500,000 won, 700,000 won and 1 million won. He made a puppy which was aggressive and had to be found by taking it away from the person who didn't raise it properly. If dogs are aggressive, the guardian is responsible for more than half of what makes them aggressive. You shouldn't let him keep a dog. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > even that way. So don't get me wrong now, folks. Don't get wrong. "" I don't think this is what you should say when you let go of all your dogs freely. I think we should find a better way to direct management, not to be uniform in this easy way, and that's what you're talking about. ♫ Kang Hyung-wook > Sure. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > president of dogs.

The two men remained in contact with 911 agents and sped up up to 90 miles per hour (about 145 kilometers) while Kelly's car crashed into a road sign and overturned. When Wilford stopped and pulled out of the truck, he pointed a gun at Kelly and shouted, "" Get out of the truck! "" But Kelly did not move. About five minutes later, police arrived. Based on the evidence at the scene, police concluded that Kelly killed herself with a gun. Wilford and Langendorf's brave act prevented the shooting from becoming a bigger tragedy."" The first priority of the law enforcement agencies is to make the gunman powerless, "" said Freeman Martin of the Texas Public Security Agency. Sen. Ted Cruise (Republican and Texas), who visited the scene of the shooting, praised the ordinary citizen who blocked the gunman, saying, We should praise the courage shown by one person. When asked if he sees himself as a hero, Langendorf said, "" I don't really know how it feels, "" and "" I wanted families and people who were affected by this incident to know that the gunman would no longer breathe and hurt anyone else's sleep.

Kim Myeong-jin, a reporter at littleprince@hani.co.kr (The photo and the article is not directly related) worked as a part-timer at a snack bar, coffee shop, and convenience store since the second grade. I need transportation money and some snacks to buy, but it was hard to open my hands to my parents every time. Last year, he worked at a charcoal galbi restaurant every weekend for 6 months. It was a ' serving job ' that carried side dishes and drinks in restaurants. I worked for more than 11 hours a day and received 70,000 won per day in cash. It took more than an hour from my house to the restaurant by bus, but when I worked like this, I could get my hands on about 600,000 won a month. It was a lot of money for high school students. The satisfaction of earning pocket money with my hand was short-lived. The restaurant was harsh to the teenager part-timer. The restaurant manager said, "" I was slow to pick up the tab for my guest house, "" and began shouting abuse against Lee from the first day. One day, he made a mistake in serving food and took her to the corner of a restaurant where no one was found. Without knowing what to say, Lee just went to the bathroom and cried. The meal I spent working at the restaurant was miserable. Next to the kitchen sink, he tipped over a large basin and made a table for the occasion, and the part-timer took turns to make do with the meal. The manager collected the meat left by the customer, heated it again, and served it as a side dish. He managed his part-timer by making Kakao Talk's ' Dantock Room.

"" The Gwangju Youth Human Rights Network heard this from students while launching a labor rights campaign at a special school in July. Students asked for advice on how to deal with verbal abuse, assault and low pay at the cafeteria. When I checked the restaurant in Damyang County, South Jeolla Province, I found out that it had been introduced to the TV restaurant several times, and I used up to five teenagers a week and 15 weekends. However, he did not draw up a contract for work and gave the workers cash and left no related documents.

Police are investigating the restaurant manager's alleged sexual harassment. Various civic groups held regular rallies in front of the restaurant demanding special labor supervision. Meanwhile, the restaurant steadily reached an agreement with the victims, and the agreement ended with 18 students who would pay late payment. The restaurant representative said on a phone with < The Hankyoreh > that "" The Boys "" worked one or two days a week. I don`t know whether I should give the overtime payment or not, explained the government official. Labor in Gwangju is often not even possible because teenagers ` work does not even have relevant records, said Park Seo-young, a labor rights activist at Gwangju Youth Human Rights Network.

Among teenagers who have worked part-time, three out of ten said they experienced unfair wage treatment, including overdue wages and unpaid overtime pay. The percentage of "" I've heard a lot of abuse from my employer or boss "" was 9.7 percent out of ten. Meanwhile, 71.7 percent of the teens said they experienced unfair treatment but did not respond. Workers who did not receive the minimum wage were the most among teenagers. In 2013, the minimum wage was less than 11.4 percent of all wage earners, of whom more than half (54.5 percent) of whom were under 19 years of age. Labor Relations Adviser Kim Byung-chul said, Although labor laws are not always enforced at work in Korea regardless of age or industry, teenagers, especially teenagers, are more likely to suffer disadvantages due to their age. Teenagers should also consider thorough labor supervision of a high-working workplace and pay more fines for violating the work-related law on minors.

Two terminals, which can accommodate 18 million passengers per year, are operated by four airlines - Korean Air, Delta Airlines, Air France and KLM. / Incheon International Airport Corp., which is scheduled to open in January next year, has launched a major reorganization of its Incheon Airport Master Plan, which began in 2006. Following the review of the plan, the location of the terminal layout has been decided. The construction of the second terminal began when Heerim Comprehensive Building Consortium was elected in the Design Contest for June 2011. Helim Engineering & Construction is a leading Korean architectural firm that designed Incheon Airport Terminal 1 and Tower Seung-dong, while Gensler, a consortium of foreign firms, also participated in the San Francisco Airport, Detroit Airport and Singapore's Changi Airport. In the basic design from 2011 to 2012 and in the design process from 2013 to 2015, the consortium has taken into consideration future plans for further expansion ▲ Optimizing the flow of transit passengers and baggage _ and overcame problems in operating the existing terminal and tower. The two terminal facilities were designed to have five underground and ground floors, 387,000 ㎡ in total area, and 18 million people per year.Incheon International Airport Terminal 2 was promoted as a fastrack to handle part of construction during its construction to speed up construction. In June 2013, the construction of framing, exterior, finishing and supplementary facilities was carried out sequentially, starting with earth works. The total cost of constructing two terminals and their related facilities is 5 trillion won. With an input volume of 2,160,000 square meters, this is six times larger than that of the construction of Dubai's tallest building, Burj Khalifa.◇ Development of the World's Top 3 Very Large Airports '' Incheon International Airport Corp. conducted a total of 88 test runs until the end of last month before its second terminal opened. In the test run period, the company sent in 21,000 virtual passengers, 59,000 virtual baggage, and four airplanes to conduct a thorough inspection of the two terminal facilities and to deal with potential failures. During this period, all areas of the aircraft were checked, including ground movement, flight information processing, fire response, and traffic information processing were carried out.Overseas Airport is delayed by political decision, lack of understanding of airport construction business characteristics, difference in stance among various agencies, and failed to open terminal doors for more than one year. Incheon International Airport Corp.'s chief executive officer, Baek Jung-sun, said, "" We could get to the hospital because of stomach cramps caused by stress, or because of employees ' efforts to open the facility without having to go through a big dust bomb next year, "" adding, terminal openings were possible.The construction is scheduled to carry out construction related to tenant companies, such as duty-free shops, and preparation for relocation of airline facilities and training for airport workers for the remaining two months. We plan to finish preparations for the opening by the 15th of next month, the airport corporation said.Incheon International Airport Corp. is also preparing an expansion project to expand the terminal. The main idea of the project is to invest 4.2 trillion won to expand the terminal and build a four-run runway. If the third terminal and the fifth runway are built with the five-stage expansion project, the final stage after the fourth, Incheon Airport will grow to accommodate 130 million passengers per year, much bigger than now. Construction Minister Kim Young-woong of Incheon International Airport said, After completing the fifth-stage expansion project, Incheon International Airport could grow to be one hundred and sixty million people worldwide by 2030, and Changi Airport in Singapore and alone by 2025.

"Seoul Apartment Market Communiqué Kim In-cheol : After Real Estate Countermeasures, the Seoul Metropolitan apartment transaction was seen to have decreased by more than 60 percent in August by just one morning. The number of apartments to be sold in Seoul decreased to 15,000 from 15,000 in yatoya@yna.co.kr7 and 5,000 in August, and since September when housing prices were soaring 70-80 % to 80 % in Nowon-gu and Gangnam, real estate transaction in Seoul was decreased by three to four months. In particular, Gangnam and Nowon-gu, which are concentrated on banning the transfer of the status of members of the Reconstruction Union and limiting loans, saw a noticeable decrease in the number of Gangnam districts and Nowon-gu. Yonhap News Agency reported on July 7 that the prices of apartments listed by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOCT) were reported on a contract basis, and reduced the total number of apartment sales by 43,172 cases (July), down by 63,172 cases). Among them, the number of contracts at apartments in Seoul decreased 65.7 percent from the previous month (14,978) to 5,136, the biggest decline in the nation. As the government's August 2 real estate measures blocked loans and lowered the number of purchases, contracts for real estate purchases decreased to one-third. Apartment Landscape Apartment Unit in Songpa-gu, Seoul This statistic is the actual number of apartments sold and sold in the month, as opposed to the housing sales surveyed and published by the Ministry of Land, Transport and Energy on a monthly basis. As the reporting period is 60 days, the actual volume of housing transactions is precise compared to the reporting date for the month due to a delay of two months from the contract to the actual purchase price. In August, the official figures for the government showed that the volume of apartment sales in Seoul increased to 15,421 from 15,688 in July, but the results of the buying and selling spree of apartments in July. Seoul distinguished Seoul transactions in speculative areas, mostly concentrated on lending and reconstruction regulations, plummeted. Further loans were prohibited in speculative areas if more than one mortgage loan was found after the 8-2 measures. Apartments in Nowon-gu saw their contracts fall by 79 percent to 399 cases in August from 1,899 cases in July, dealing a direct blow to regulations. Nowon-gu, where the number of apartments for the low-income bracket is concentrated, was designated as speculation zones and speculation zones because prices increased right before the government announced plans to build up. Songpa district saw a 78.3 percent decline from 1,190 in July to 236 in August, and Gangnam-gu saw a significant decline in transactions from 1,200 to 235 in September, down 76.9 percent and Gangdong-gu from 89.4. Another reason for the decline in the Gangnam area is the fact that the transfer of the membership status of the reconstruction complex has been prohibited following the endorsement of the establishment of the union in overheated speculation zones. Although the Gangnam area is not the Gangnam area, Seongdong-gu (- 73.4 %) and Yangcheon-gu (- 72.3 %), designated as speculation areas also saw their sales fall more than 70 % in August from the previous month. The operating district (- 67.2 percent), Gwangjin-gu (- 66.5 percent), Dobong-gu (- 66.1 percent), Seocho-gu (- 64.1 percent), and Yeongdeungpo-gu (- 63.9 percent) were also significantly decreased. View of apartments complex in Sanggye-dong, Nowon-gu, Seoul, which was hit directly by the 8.2 measures [Yonhap news agency photo]. Outside of Seoul, Sejong City's transactions have dropped by less than half. In August, the number of sales dropped 54.6 percent to 252 in July. Sejong City is the only place in the province to have double regulations on overheated speculation zones and speculative areas. Actual cases of real estate agents declined slightly, with Busan falling 19.1 percent and Daegu 9.6 percent after measures by the other provinces that had relatively fewer transactions in July. But Seoul apartment sales showed some improvement in September after the impact of the Aug. 2 package. Apartment sales nationwide dropped 13.8 percent from August on the contract date, but apartments in Seoul saw their sales rise to 5,657 points, exceeding the previous month. Housing contracted in September were not listed on the market as it was not due to be reported until the 60th anniversary of the end of its purchase date, which is already exceeding the August contract. Amid delayed government announcements of additional measures such as the household debt prevention measures and the roadmap for housing welfare, reconstruction-oriented efforts to rebuild Songpa Jamsil Jugong, Site 50, and other favorable factors are expected to boost trade. Songpa-gu reported 474 contracts in September last year, doubling the number of contracts reached 236 in August, as Jamsil Jugong 5 Danji deals rose. Seocho-gu (292 cases), Gangnam-gu (365 cases), Gangdong-gu (235 cases), and Nowon-gu (436 cases) also reported actual transactions in September. A representative of a brokerage firm in Banpo-dong, Seocho-gu said, "" As regulations were enforced on speculative buying from September 26, the sale price of apartments in Seoul increased by one to two months, the impact of reported sales has been on the usual market price index for several days or even more. "" However, since October, the deal has been likely to be retreated due to the effects of the household debt prevention measures announced last month and the housing welfare roadmap this month. "" How many homes or how many multiple home owners will sell in the coming April will have a strong influence on house prices and the volume of transactions, "" said Lee Mi-yoon, director of the Real Estate 114, after the March Roadmap for household debt. sms@yna.co.kr a contact area, all (Click!) the latest fashion trend here is the report and (Make sure you tell the story headline.)

"According to research conducted by about 908 patients at Inha University, Samsung Asan Hospital and Seoul Asan Hospital, 10 percent of Koreans who eat fruit more than once a day experience lung cancer risk (Seoul = Yonhap news agency) are suffering from lung cancer. In addition, 22 percent of all cancer deaths were due to lung cancer, the most common cause of death among all cancers in the nation. Smoking is best known as the cause of lung cancer. Experts say more than 80 percent of lung cancer cases are related to smoking. Other causes are asbestos, radon, radiation and air pollutants. Although air pollutants are blamed on fine dust (PM 10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), the link with actual lung cancer is not clear yet. Among them, people who live within a 2-kilometer radius of a bus stop with lots of air pollutants such as car exhaust gas are at up to twice the risk of getting lung cancer.A joint research team at Inha University Hospital, Samsung Medical Center and Asan Hospital announced during the joint study that they received confirmation of lung cancer in comparison with 908 people who had been examined by scientists at the clinic during the past two years. The study results were published in the November issue of the International Journal of Academic Journal. Lung cancer patients were diagnosed at an average age of 61, with 62 percent more men than women (38 percent). Twenty-three percent of male patients were smokers at the time of the survey. The research team divided lung cancer patients into those who were surveyed based on their age, gender, smoking experiences and exposure to carcinogens in the workplace, comparing their rates with those of lung cancer. For air pollutants, the concentration of local, particulate matter (PM 10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) per year were estimated by backtracking them into an address history of 20 years (1995 - 2014) for each patient. As a result, the rate of lung cancer increased by 1.09 times each time the level of fine dust (PM 10) increased by 10 U.S.C. It was also reported that nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a component of car exhaust gas, increases the rate of lung cancer by 1.10 times as 10 ppb increases. This link between air pollution and lung cancer rates was stronger among non-smokers with no smoking experience, people with fewer fruit intake, and people with higher education. In terms of lung cancer, platypellic cell carcinoma and small cell carcinoma were more related to air pollution than ovarian cancer, which has a high incidence of cancer.A lung cancer risk was estimated to be 2.01 times that of anyone who lives within a 2-kilometer radius of a bus or taxi stop. In addition, the risk of lung cancer for those who live within a two-kilometer radius of the incinerator in industrial complexes was 1.18 times higher than that of others. Under the same conditions, the transmission tower increased the risk of lung cancer by 1.13 times. The research team explained that the study's systematic link to lung cancer was significant, as it evaluated air pollution exposure based on 20 years of residential history among the nation`s largest lung cancer patients. However, the distance between residential areas, dangerous facilities and eating habits could have a slightly different effect on actual lung cancer, as they are based on patients ` subjective answers, the researchers added. Since the lungs have no sense, they can not feel pain even when damaged due to tuberculosis or infections. Similarly, most of the early stage of lung cancer are free of symptoms. Even with coughs or phlegm, they are often mistaken for colds, making it difficult to spot them early. Therefore, it is more important to find them at an early stage after regular medical checkup. Treatment should start with no symptoms before it works. Director of the research department, Professor of occupational environmental medicine at Inha University Hospital, said, "" People who ate fruit more than once a day despite exposure to air pollutants were at a low risk of getting lung cancer when they ate more than once a month. "" bio@yna.co.kr Ventz, in particular, sold the largest sales among imported cars in Korea from January to October this year, but failed to make sufficient profits and was not able to protect drivers.The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced yesterday that 17 vehicles equipped with Takata airbags were sold in Korea, among whom 14 are being recalled. However, the three Mercedes-Benz, GM Korea and GM Korea have not replied to the recalls in spite of repeated requests from the ministry. Fears have been raised that an air bag manufactured by Takasaku, Japan could cause injury to a driver due to the excessive explosion of an inflator when the air bag was released in an accident. So far, 19 people have been killed and 200 injured in Takata air bag related accidents worldwide. Because of this, Takata airbags are also called "" Dead Airbags, "" and about 100 million recalls have been carried out worldwide since 2013.In Korea, the Mercedes-Benz C-Class [Combined News Photo] released in 2007, Korean manufacturers such as Hyundai, Kia, and Ssangyong did not use Dakata airbags, but passenger cars were recalled due to safety concerns. No Takata air bag accident has yet been reported to Korea, but the ministry last year called in imported car companies to expand its recall. Import carmakers have initially been rather lukewarm, but joined forces with 14 recalling them, said a ministry official. According to the ministry, among the Korean cars sold by Benz, GM Korea and GM Korea, there are 165,861 vehicles equipped with Dakata airbags. Among them, Benz sold 12,611 C-class, 2,476 GLK units and 810 E class units, which were manufactured between 2007 and 2012, to Korea. GM Korea has sold 146,788 cars between 2009 and 2012, including 72,820 RacettI Premier and 42,244 cruise cars, GM Korea has sold 9-3,562 Saab and Handackelly-Handy 228 cars in 2005. The three Benz companies do not respond to the recall because their cars have not had a Dakata air-based accident yet and an internal investigation into the cause of the defect is underway. Benz told the Ministry of Land that it will decide whether to recall 284 cars from their cars sold in Korea by the end of this year after experimenting with German headquarters research institutes. However, the explanation of the Mercedes-Benz became lame when it was revealed that the company is about to begin recalling 350,000 cars in China on July 15. Ventz recalls vehicles of the same class as SLK and Class A manufactured in 2006-2012, which are of the same make sold domestically. In response to this news, Benz customers discriminate against Korean customers because of nothing else but safety issues, "" It seems like they are selling a lot in Korea, and they are complaining about having a gutsy business here. "" Consumer sovereignty civic groups held a news conference last month and said it was irresponsible not to call for a product that could not be recalled safely for drivers. We are closely monitoring whether the other teams are actually recalling the products from China, a ministry official said.◇ Dakata Airbags equipped with domestic sales (Mercedes-Benz, GM, and GM Korea) ※ Data = Inquiring the article at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Transport (Be sure to give us the title) and reporting are being collected here (click trends)."

"▽ Iron & Fish Research Institute status = Most nine places in Seoul are concerned about sanitation management, poor animal protection restaurants and small farms ; most of them are worried about losing weight in the small metal cage that could lead to diseases Animal cafes and raccoon cafes, which breed and display wild animals, and are thriving around the country, but sanitary and animal management were not enough to provide quick attention. Animal cafes or raccoon cafes refer to food restaurants that allow customers to show and touch animals while selling food or drinks. The Wildlife Institute released its research report on the nature of wildlife cafes Monday after investigating the operation of nine animal cafes in Seoul. Urware found that at least 35 wild animal cafes were operating throughout the country via Internet, and since last August, nine of them have been operating in Seoul. According to research, 41 of the raccoon and 26 meerkat dogs are kept at the nine sites. Raccoon, the animal of the American Nuguris family, is loved by children with its cute image. It grows to 50 cm tall and weighs 10 kg when it is fully grown in North America and South America. Meerkats are South African native mongoose animals. He is famous for standing on two feet and watching out for the birds of prey that eat him. The report pointed out that humans, animals, animals and animals are most likely to develop a common pandemic. Six of the nine animal cafes surveyed were operating without separating the spaces in which animals were used and the places where visitors could drink. Animal cafes mostly have not separated the animal breeding area from the places where visitors eat. There are also four locations with hand sanitizers installed, but only one business has instructed you to disinfect your hand on the street, and one with sterilizing information attached. While many of the studies were conducted on six animals, no one had ever set up a separate nursery by animal species. Animal cafes mostly breed different kinds of animals at once, without separating. The report also pointed out that there was a lack of consideration for war animals. Only one shelter provided complete privacy for visitors to avoid contact or gaze. In addition, three out of nine places kept animals that were not on display in small metal cage isolated from each other. In isolation, normal actions such as walking or standing up were not possible, and feet were not touching the ground. It was estimated that due to the structure of the breeding area, animals are easily exposed to noise. The average length of display at companies was 10 hours per day, and some companies are operating for up to 14 hours. In many companies, traumatic animals were observed, while lethargic or repetitive animals were noted. In animal cafes, injured or sick animals are often left in narrow metal cages. Lee Hyung-joo, head of Awayer, said, Unlike the outdoor owners at the animal cafes, animals can not move around on trees or dig up dirt easily, so the animals can not suffer from stress. Since 2013, the country has imported 267 animals into the country, and some of them are traded on the Internet for two to three million won each. Meanwhile, the raccoon is not an endangered species, so there is no obligation to report it if he dies. "" Some states, in Belgium and the Netherlands, that the European Union is designated as a species to disturb the ecosystem if it spreads to the wild because it is highly fertile, "" Lee said. Animals that try to scratch the walls and climb abnormal behavior. Many animals raised at animal cafes exhibit abnormal behavior or aggression. The report called for "" a ban on the display of wild animals in food housewares, and a need for regulations on wildlife trade and personal ownership "". Currently, the law only regulates endangered wild animals, and the animal protection law regulates certain species, including dogs and cats. Without the animal protection law, raccoon or meerkat are in the restricted blind spot. Meanwhile, Urware is scheduled to hold a ' discussion for revising the law on zoos ' at the small room of the National Assembly Library in Yeouido at 2:00 p.m. on July 8 to point out the problems and solve them.

"< Conscienceless denial of military service # People's perceptions have changed a lot, however … # Conscientious refusal to accept conscription # ' increased every year, and there is no sign of change in the ' conscientious objectors ' law, which is not yet worth using the same 500 %. ' Park Mi-so : Internist, journalist, and conviction : Refusing to serve in the military. From their point of view, it is a case of conscience that you are trying to avoid having a hard time in the army. But judging by the instances of keeping faith and losing a civil servant's job as a regular school teacher, it is also apparent that a conscientious objector weighs a lot of money. Kim Hoon-tae (38), who passed the examination to be appointed as an elementary school teacher in Gyeonggi Province and has worked as an elementary school teacher in Pyeongtaek since 2002. Kim was released on parole at the end of July 2007 after serving one year and three months. Of course, I lost my elementary school teacher. As such cases accumulate year after year, the Korean people, who were only one in 10 people in favor of conscientious objectors last year, approved them last year. The extra strain that had leaned to one side is now tense. Conscientious objectors, who are they?About 500 conscientious objectors are seen every year. According to a report that Park Beom-gye, a fisherman's lawmaker, refused to serve in the army from 2013 until August of this year, and the number of people who were prosecuted amounted to 2,356. Religious beliefs (2,341 people) account for the largest share of reasons for refusing to serve in the military, but more recently than not a few reasons are based on personal reasons, such as anti-war, non-violent opinions, and peace. A total of 15 people, including 8 in 2013, 1 in 2014, 3 in 2015, 2 in 2015 and 1 in August this year cited ‘ Other personal beliefs ’ as the reason for joining the army and refusing home guns. Hong Jeong-hun (27), who is currently working as a civic activist, is one of them. Having developed an artist's dream while majoring in music, he decided to boycott the military in 2015 because of the fact that it is a diverse society.Hong Jeong-hun (28), who was sentenced to one and a half years in jail for conscientious objectors, listens to related rulings at the People`s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy in Seoul yesterday. Park Mi-so : For whatever reason, conscientious objectors are mostly sentenced to jail for violating the Military Service Law. "" Anyone who receives an active military service or calls shall face up to three years in jail unless he or she joins the Army without a justifiable reason or agrees to call up "" in accordance with Article 88 of the Military Service Act. Over five years, 1,693 people, or 71.9 percent of objectors for military conscription and home use, have already been sentenced to jail, which is the minimum standard for exemption from military service, the court said. Hong was sentenced to one and a half years in jail in April this year and appealed, awaiting a second trial. Hong said, I chose to appeal to conscientious objectors instead of appealing to them, which is why the government is discussing the issue of conscientious objectors, saying it is a positive change, and the government is in the process of discussing the issue. They are basically restricted to civil servants. Kim Hoon-tae immediately set out to find a job to earn a living after he was released from prison, but there was no school to accept him as a full-time teacher or as a after-school tutoring instructor. Under the law, public officials can not afford to hire anyone who is not more than five years old after being sentenced to jail or higher. However, it is not easy to return to the "" five-year "" teaching profession in a country that is sensitive to draft dodging. Kim, who used to wander around for the first time in six months since he was released from prison, was appointed as an alternative school to the game in early 2008 and is currently the head of the Education Research Institute, Steiner Sasang. "" I spent my time desponsively saying, ' When I get out of jail, I have never been able to go anywhere, and I never go back to being close to my children, ' "" Kim said, saying, "" but my conviction that I was firmly committed. Baek Jong-geon (age 33, Law School 40), who was sentenced to jail for refusing to serve in the military due to religious beliefs, was refused to register with the Korean Bar Association in May. The lawyer's law states that a person who is sentenced to a sentence greater than a safe and whose execution is less than five years old can not become a lawyer. As it is difficult to get a job at a private company, many public organizations, including schools and big businesses, find it very sensitive to avoid military service, and many others do not. Most of them say they work for small businesses that do not ask whether they should serve in the military, or they prefer small businesses. Oh Doo-jin, a lawyer who has served as the lawyer for hundreds of conscientious objectors, said, "" Once a person does not finish their military service, it is hard for companies to discriminate against it, "" especially when it comes to avoiding military service. Amid this trend, the public's sense of conscientious objectors is constantly changing. According to the National Human Rights Commission's 2016 survey on the rights and human rights record, only 12.1 percent answered that they were in favor of allowing conscientious objectors in 2005, but the number rose to 3.1.3 percent in 2011 and 46.1 percent last year. In addition, the number of conscientious objectors who are found to be innocent of military service from 2004 to September of this year was 52, with 35 cases out of which, more than half, concentrated this year, and the judgment of the court is also changing. That is why it is fair to say that there is no need to fulfill the military. However, the Supreme Court has not yet acquitted anyone. Still, with no higher voice to object to the government's argument, more people are expressing great concern over admitting conscientious objectors and introducing a substitute service. Yoo Dong-yeol, director of the Center for Freedom and Democracy, said, It is impossible to say that a conscience depends purely on one's personal values, but whether one refuses to serve in the military or not is real. The main reason for opposing the alternative service system is that it could pose a serious threat to national security amid growing unrest on the Korean Peninsula and a shortage of military service resources due to a declining population. The Defense Ministry expects the 20-year-old male population, which is about 350,000 as of this year, to drop drastically to the 220,000 to 250,000 level after 2022. In particular, 200-80,000 police officers, marine police, industrial functions, and expert researchers are required to provide support to each field in 200-300,000 regular personnel in 20240. If the government recognizes alternative service, those who are subject to military conscription are highly likely to avoid military service and choose alternative service. Yang Yoon-sook, lawyer of the Center for Human Rights and Reunification of the Korean Peninsula, said in a report by the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Germany, "" The ratio of emergency service to alternative service was 31 percent to 33 percent in 1979, "" with a huge increase in risk. The Defense Ministry announced its plan to introduce a "" Social Security System for the Promotion of Service by Minorities of Military Service (which was twice active at that time, including the introduction of a 36-month substitute service system) "" in December 2008. However, it strongly agreed on the following year. This July, the NHRC advised the ministry to introduce a substitute service for conscientious objectors, a situation the ministry has yet to discuss immediately "" necessary measures "" before it decides on the issue. Some of the countries with many conscription have already adopted a substitute service. Among 83 countries worldwide that maintain conscription as of 2012, 31 recognize conscientious objectors, while Taiwan, Germany, Russia, Austria, Israel and Poland are allowed to serve in place. The nation's Justice Ministry immediately submitted a third national human rights review (UPR) by consulting government ministries and agencies this August, saying, "" It is possible to submit a third national review (UPR) to the United Nations. "" Shin Ji-hoo, a reporter at the Korea International Federation of Animal Health, holds a "" news conference in jail "" at Gwanghwamun North Plaza in Seoul on May 15. At a news conference, the members demanded that the government stop punishing objectors based on conscience and introduce a substitute service. Korean daily newspaper [Facebook].

Broadcom plans to acquire Qualcomm and make it into One-Chip, a combination of Tongsin chip and AP. U.S. political circles seem to support the merger of Broadcom and Qualcom. Or a Broadcom Chief Executive Officer (ceo) at the White House, Trump met the president announced that he “will relocate to the United States from its head office to Singapore”. Citing the Republican Party`s tax reform package, which reduces corporate taxes from 35 percent to 20 percent, he praised the United States as the best place to lead multinational operations. Trump, who was watching from the president is a good frame of smiled and said, “Thank you.” Broadcom's acquisition of Qualcomm was revealed shortly after the company announced its plan to relocate its headquarters to the United States. Broadcom is now a Singapore firm. Last year, he was transferred to Abago, a semiconductor company in Singapore. Abago, who started out as HP's semiconductor company, bought Broadcom America and renamed it Broadcom. Its headquarters are in Singapore and its operations center is located in California, the United States. However, Broadcom's takeover offer is highly likely to fail. Qualcom is to reject Broadcom's proposal, the Financial Times said, citing anonymous insiders. The New York Times also reported that Qualcomm is expected to refuse the acquisition proposal. Although we are carefully reviewing the offer, Qualcomm said that the acquisition price suggested was too low. Though Broadcom offered a premium of 28 % on its current stock price, Qualcom believes the current stock price level is too low.Qualcomm faced various lawsuits on the issue of patent fee. It has already fined 6.88 billion yuan (1.5 trillion won) in China, 1.03 trillion won in Korea, and 23.4 billion U.S. dollars (878 billion won) in Taiwan, followed by a bid by Qualcomm investigation. Qualcomm's biggest client, Apple, sued earlier this year for "" unfair patent fees, "" and said last month that it would "" not use Qualcomm chip in the future. "" These issues are when the stock has excessively dropped. We don`t think it would be surprising if Qualcomm rejects the acquisition proposal, said Algelogino, an analyst at CFRA Research.Anseungchan (ahnsc@edaily.co.kr) ▶ edaily of an event celebrating - Galaxy Note, ▶ [Kakao Talk] at 8 coupons copiously to Starbucks, peulchin ♥ < © 5 Kits combine a comprehensive financial information media.Pyeongtaek edaily - illegal ban on war damage and redistribution of the visit in his first speech >, smashing American airplanes chief constable 'trade' said after situation report on the peninsula ""After a while regarding the meeting"" and "" in the long run.It must be addressed will work itself out, "" Donald Trump, who arrived in Korea the United States president and his wife (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) = 7 inauguration, American president is Donald Trump. press ganggeontaekAfter first trip to South Korea said, ""() great cooperation with South Korea."".
