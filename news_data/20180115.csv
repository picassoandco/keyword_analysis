"North Korean delegation member of the North Korean Olympic delegation, Hyun Song-wol (Unification Ministry) and North Korean Olympic team head Yang Eun-gak (Unification Ministry) held an interview with North Korean delegation at the Unification Ministry's Unification Ministry in Seoul Thursday. It is not yet known what kind of remarks and attitude Hyun made during the negotiation.South Korean actress Hyun Song-wol, who wore a navy suit, appeared at the conference with a light smile on her face. She wore a Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il badge on her left breast. Hyun Song-wol, once a famous singer in North Korea, is currently considered a key figure in the North Korean art field. He appeared with a rank insignia on his back in 2014 and is known to be in his mid to late 30s. Last October, Kim Jong Un was strongly trusted as he was selected as a candidate for the party's central committee in the 7th general meeting of the party's central committee. There are also rumors here that he is the former lover of Kim Jong Un. As head of the North Korean delegation, Hyun Song-wol, participates as a North Korean delegation to exchange art between the two Koreas, it is also very interesting to see whether Moranbong, his musical troupe, will be included in Pyeongchang's bid to host the Games. The Moranbong band, made up of good-looking female singers and performers, is receiving public attention for being called "" North Korean girl groups. "" When they are included in the delegation, their first venue for overseas performances will be in Korea. North Korea's Moranbong Band arrived in Beijing. (Photo Source : Shinhwa-News) In each case, Moranbong Band is concerned about North Korea's behavior because they are all soldiers, and because they are the main unit of propaganda in the North. In fact, he returned to Beijing in 2015 after canceling a performance at a third party in question over how to promote the system. Hyun Song-wol is known to have ordered the withdrawal. Last July, he celebrated launching a intercontinental ballistic missile (ICP-14). For this reason, it is expected that the working-level talks in Pyongyang will need to discuss the North Korean art group's costumes, performances, and contents in detail. Hyun Song-wol, head of the Orchestra of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics ' North Korean art team, attended a working-level meeting to discuss the dispatch of the delegation to North Korea at the Unification Hall in the northern port city of Panmunjeom on July 15. 2018.1.15.1 / News 1 ─ News 1 Hur Kyung-gyeong : Read news and photo in Pyeongchang 2018.

International Standards refer to the Global Burden of Division Study (GBD) developed by WHO and are published by the University of Washington in Washington in detail. WHO offers nine foods that should be eaten a lot due to their chronic diseases, including fruits and vegetables, and four red meat and sweetened beverages. The study analyzed the eating patterns of 46,656 adults aged 25 to 74 who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Survey 2007-2015. Koreans have been advised to eat more than the minimum amount of food intake from 2013 to 2015, which includes omega-3 fatty acids of plant-blued fish, and highly unsaturated fatty acids of vegetable oils such as beans and corn. A fruit market in Daegu [Central Photo], in which a woman only met her recommendation (more than 200g to 300g per day), was taken at 214.5g a day. Men weigh only 176.7 grams. Broken down by age group, men aged 25 to 44 were below the standard of 146.9 g and women 185.1 g. Despite growing fruit consumption since 2007, men and women have not been getting enough, said Oh Kyung-won, director of the Health and Nutrition Research Division at the KCDC. Vegetables are also slightly more increased (male 263 g, female 219.9 g), but fall short of recommended standards (340 - 500g per day). In addition, the young adults aged 25 to 44 have changed little or nothing. Nuts, seeds, and calcium from California nut, walnut, and pine nuts should be half as long as the recommended value. In the case of rough food (whole meal) such as whole grains or brown rice, men eat 17.6 grams per day, and women eat 16.5 grams. Slightly more than 10 % of the recommended value (100-150 g). Milk is similar. Recommended standard is 350 to 520 grams per day, with an intake of only 53.3 grams for men and 54.7 grams for women. Consumption of processed meat such as ham and sausage is skyrocketing.[Central Photo] Processing meat such as ham and sausage (recommended 0 to 4 g per day) recommended by the WHO shall be 8.7 g per day for men and 6.5 g for women. Both men and women have increased their intake by 70 % since 2007. Consumption has doubled for the elderly and the elderly from 45 to 74 years of age. Beverages containing sugars such as Coke and Cider (recommended 0 - 5 g) are more dangerous. Men eat as much as 299.2 grams and women eat 208.8 grams. It is growing exponentially every year. A scene of trimming the pork[Central Photo] Red meat is also recommended not to exceed 18-27 grams per day, but in reality, men eat 74.8 grams and women take 46.7 grams. Eat up to four times the reference value. We are pleased that seven out of the 13 foods, including fruits and vegetables, are doing better than how much they are worth, Oh Kyung-won, director of the institute said. Oh added that the problem is that the omega-3 fatty acids, red meat, processed meat and sweetened beverages of blueback fish are getting worse and worse. Lack of calcium and milk intake is still not improving. "" Eating habits affect chronic diseases more than smoking or drinking, so we should focus more on improving our eating habits, "" he said. Shin Seong-sik, a welfare reporter at the Korean Central Daily News Agency, arrested on charges of "" South Korea's Facebook + Friends "" and "" Korea's Mobile Community Hub "" for illegally redistributing Korean food market. According to Binghailbo, a 43-year-old Korean who stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in West Kowloon, Hong Kong, called his friend in Seoul at the end of the day to call him on the phone. A friend in Korea called the police in a hurry, and the police called the Korean consulate in Hong Kong again. When Hong Kong police went to the scene, his wife, B (43), and her seven-year-old son were found stabbed to death. There was a 13-centimeter long weapon on the site. A man arrested on suspicion of murder was drunk and could not answer police questions properly. Rooms are the scene of the accident were not very messy, and there were no signs of a big argument or protest. Police will find the medicine at the scene and investigate whether it is related to the crime through autopsies. After arriving in Hong Kong on July 6, the A`s family went to Macau, then returned to Hong Kong on July 10, and planned to check out of the room the previous day. The Ritz-Carlton hotel, where the A`s family stayed, is situated on the 15th floor of the International Business Center (ICC), the highest building in Hong Kong. It is a high-end hotel with overnight accommodation costs at least 330-24,500-500,000 won. Although she was usually busy, she went to 63 Building or a grocery store she runs with her family and posted a photo of her son's birthday party on Facebook. A is said to be the Korean representative of multinational food companies that opened several stores in downtown Seoul. Instagram has even posted, "" The only source of new energy for me every day is my family.

Bae Seong-hyeok, a research director at Daedong Cultural Properties Research Institute, said, Although many of the tombs are small in size, most of them have been stolen, but not least a few have been found.The tools used by the Royal Tomb of King Gosandong-dong and the Namdong-bangsan Maldeul, which are to be used in the excavation research into the Gobuk-gun Ancient Tomb of Myeongsan-dong, North Gyeongsang Province (Historic Site No.29), are equipped with tools photo@yna.co.kr In addition to iron helmets, stirrups, bits, horse saddles, and horse stirrups were excavated here. Among them, roof-and-matching tools, such as the sea waves and a horse that reminds of snakes, were found 60cm long, also in part of No.018 in Jisan-dong. Similar patterns of horse lantern tools are found in the mural paintings of Goguryeo, such as Tonggu, the Tomb of the Great Wall of Korea, and Ssangyeongchong.

"" The investigators explained that iron weapons and harness excavated from the tomb are expected to help restore the image of the mounted warrior in Dae Gaya. In the latest research, a skeleton in a very good condition was found in one of the tombs that was built as if to surround the number 391 in the southern part of the area. The bone was lying straight, believed to be an adult with a height of more than 160 cm. It appears that the human skeleton remained very good because the tomb was not robbed, Bae said, Further studies were needed to find out about the panent`s gender, status and burial habits.Relics from Gobun-gun, Jisan-dong, Seoul.

The purpose of the measures is to determine if the fire department's slow response and poor handling resulted in serious damages. It is the first time in 26 years that the fire department has been searched and searched since its establishment in April 1992. Jecheon Fire Station is the first fire station to suffer in 39 years since its opening in 1979. Police opened a audit room on the third floor of the main building in North Chungcheong Province on the morning of the search and seizure and asked the fire department to provide necessary information. Firefighters, who were devastated after the Jecheon fire disaster, in which 29 people were killed and 40 others injured, remained mum and down as they respond with grief. When asked about the atmosphere, an official at the North Chungcheong Fire Department hurried to avoid the room, saying, What can criminals who caused casualties say? Officials at Jecheon Fire Station, which was in charge of evolution and rescue at the scene of the Jecheon fire, are equally perplexed by the initial search for seizure. The reporters are blocking access from the first floor, and are saving their breath. The unexpected search and seizure was very embarrassing and difficult, said an official at Jecheon Fire Station.

A middle-aged woman who introduced herself as a professional photographer then contacted her wife, Pam. She plans to use her special abilities to make great family photographs. So Mr. and Mrs. Jahring and their two sons took family photos with photographers at a forest park in St. Louis. `` I felt it was a good opportunity that I had never taken a proper picture of my family since I was married, '' said Mrs. Pam, "" but the cost was relatively low at $ 250.

'`` I was surprised to hear that the photographer was playing games with the pictures, '' said Mrs. Pam, explaining that the answer to her back was a stunning failure to learn Photoshop.The reason why special family pictures of the Jarrings are well known is because they posted their stories on Facebook recently. The posting was explosive enough to record more than 300,000 "" yes "" messages during the ceremony.`` First I received the photo and then I had a pleasant memory, '' Mrs. Pam laughed, complaining to the photographer, but it was no refund.　 　 　Park Jong-ik, reporter pji@seoul.co.kr"
""" 10,000 fathers are taking paternity leave as a record low in 2017. "" "" Why worry about raising the cost of their children's benefits by one-third? "" Korea is aging fast. Last year, Korea entered an aged society with more than 14 percent of the population aged 65 and over. It's only been 17 years since they entered the Aging Society (7 % or more), much faster than Japan (24), the United States (73), and France (115 years). It's not the end. The pace is getting faster, and by 2025, it will have reached a super-aged society (over 20 percent). 2017 is also the year when the productive population began to decrease (aged 15-64). Premature society is the center of aging and low birth rates. Actually, I need to separate the two. Aging may be able to deal with the accompanying social problems, but it can not solve them. Because you can't artificially or politically stop medical developments from extending your life expectancy. Graphic : Kim Young-oak, a reporter at yesok@joongang.co.kr said, "" The low birth rate is different. There must be a reason why you don't have a baby, or you can't have a baby, and if it disappears, it's not biologically impossible. It could be further promoted through policies or if the social and economic conditions of parents change. Actually, there's no set date for how long the birth rate should be. However, the United Nations is classified as a low birth rate in the second place (超) if the total fertility rate (the average number of children a single woman can give birth to) is below 1.3. Korea has been a super-exporting country for 16 years since 2001. It's definitely not normal. It has been a very small country since 2001, and the government started talking about countermeasures in 2002. It was in 2005 when the relevant laws were enacted. It was the year that the fertility rate set a record. It was in the mid 1990s that academics began to warn of the dangers of low fertility rates. I wasted 10 years, but then I paid a lot of attention. I spent more than 100 trillion won over the next 10 years trying to solve this problem. We created a system that wasn't there, we increased the number of people who were going to be eligible, and we set up various support measures. What are the consequences? The number of births dropped from 448,000 in 2006 to 356,000 last year. The total fertility rate is forecast to be between 1.06 and 1.07, up from the previous low of 1.17 in 2005. In short, it was a waste of time. Graphic : Kim Young-oak, journalist of Honor.com, feels frustrated, but today we will take a look at one of the most popular low-nation measures, paternity leave. Child leave is the leave used to raise children under the age of 8 or in the second grade of elementary school. The aim is to "" ease the burden of childcare for the workforce and keep working to ensure job security. "" The leave period is one year per child. Because it is one of the workers ' rights, if both parents are working, they can use the father and the mother for one year respectively. The length of time off is as good as anywhere else in the world. But parents say it's far from a natural setting. Why is that? First of all, I only use my mom. The biggest reasons for such misperception are "" parenting "" and "" how fathers raise their children. "" There are also practical reasons. If you take paternity leave, you will receive 80 percent of your average wage for the first three months from the start and 40 percent for the remaining nine months. Simply put, it would be beneficial for the high-earning one to take a leave of absence, but it would be different if you touched the calculator. The first three months are 1.5 million won, the next nine months are 1 million won, and the monthly limit is set like this. If the income level is above a certain level, it is financially better for the person who makes the most money to continue working. When you consider the age and full-time worker rates, they usually earn higher. In fact, 88.6 percent of the private sector's 43,460 paternity leave were women in the first half of 2017. So the government comes up with another idea. It's a bonus for taking care of your dad. If the same child is used by the parents sequentially, the first three months ' paternity leave is usually paid 100 % of the wage (two million won) by the second parent. The Employment and Labor Ministry explained that it had some effectiveness. That's true to a certain extent. In the first half of 2017, 5,011 fathers took paternity leave, 52 % more than in the same period of the previous year (3353). Among all childcare leave holders, the percentage of men also rose from 3.3 percent in 2013 to 11.3 percent. It is expected to reach the 10,000 mark for the first time on an annual basis. [Central Photo] I agree with you that this is a huge increase, but I don't see any fathers around who still take paternity leave. Why is that? In fact, 5,000. 10,000. Absolutely not the numbers. If you want to know how far away paternity leave has taken place, you need to question the percentage of total employees who have had to take time off to raise their children. It may be a case of abuse. I have no choice but to. The employment department's childcare leave statistics are a summary of people who have received benefits from the employment insurance database. A ministry official also said, I know that the proportion of the total work force is much more important, but it is difficult to calculate it realistically. We need to check how many workers are involved, whether they have children, and whether their children are eligible for paternity leave, but it is not easy unless we conduct a thorough investigation into the workplace. "" I can make a rough estimate. Among the economically active population, the number of employed men in their 20s and 30s is 52,300. Of those 10,000, it's only 176 percent. Of course, it's hard to find two out of every thousand. Of course, not all employed people in their 20s or 30s are wage earners, and not all of them have children, so the actual percentage is probably higher. However, considering the trend of married couples who are in their 40s, many parents can take paternity leave. I don't think it's any wild assumption beyond that number. Second, you should be able to work the same way you were when you returned from your leave of absence. The company that has returned has exercised its legitimate rights to work, but disadvantages in the case of presence are waiting. The Population and Health Welfare Association announced its findings on the use of paternity leave. The survey was conducted by 400 men and women who experienced paternity leave. According to the report, financial difficulties (31.0 percent) and the feelings of coworkers and bosses (19.5 percent) were the biggest obstacles to parental leave. In particular, men were most concerned about negative impacts on performance reviews (33.0 %) and women's poor competitiveness (33.5 %) due to career breaks. Graphic : Kim Young-oak, a reporter and acquaintance of yesok@joongang.co.kr Kim Jung-sik (37, alias) works for a large construction company. In 2015, she had three tough breast-instruments for her daughter. After nine months of absence, including maternity and childcare leave, she wanted to return to work. She decided to take paternity leave because she felt she couldn't put a child in someone else's hand, although she respected what she meant. The reaction in the company was cold. Even the boss, who was close enough to talk about his feelings, openly put pressure on him, saying, It was hard to accept, but I was afraid I could lose all my experience I had built. Eventually, Kim decided to call off the plan and enlist the help of his parents. Under these circumstances, it is not always possible to take a year off from work. The same survey by the Population and Health Welfare Association found that one out of five child care workers (22.3 %) use less leave than planned. They spent an average of 6.7 months in men and 8.7 months in women. Data : Take a look at the OECD chart. This is a graph by the OECD comparing the female employment rate and birth rate of each country. The percentage of women employed in Korea, which was in the middle of the 40 % in 1980, rose to the 60 % level in 2012. The fertility rate plummeted from 2.7 to 1.3 during the same period. In short, it is the fact that the fertility rate has gone down due to the rise in female employment. But more importantly, the countries at the top of the right-hand graph. There are many so-called European developed countries. Women are employed at 70 to 80 %, yet the fertility rate stays at 1.8 to 2. But they have seen a temporary decline in fertility rates as women participated in economic activities, as in Korea. And then the employment and the birth rates were going up together. So it's a first step to create an environment where women can work safely and with less birth and childcare. If Korea wants to follow them, it should start with childcare leave. The start is to reduce the financial burden on childcare leave. Sweden has an income substitution rate of about 80 % for childcare leave. The difference is that in the first place, it's not about rewarding but about living costs. The average monthly paternity leave payment in Korea in 2016 is 696,000 won. Compared to the average wage of wage earners (who earn 2,838,000 won), it is less than one-third. Pay increases were set at one million won, but only 33 percent of the people who received the full package also filled it. At least 41.7 percent of workers at large companies received the upper limit, while only 23.1 percent of small businesses received it. No wonder you're in such a tight financial situation with childcare leave. Office worker A said, "" I only get my dad's paternity leave for the first three months, even though I usually earn two million won per month."
"If you are an ideal, you are bound to see a decline in income. Graphic : Kim Young-oak's yesok@joongang.co.kr government is planning to raise the wage for childcare leave to 50 percent of what is currently the usual wage starting in 2019. They raise the ceiling from one to 1.2 million won per month and the lower limit from 500,000 won to 700,000 won. That's good news, but it's not good enough. Actually, the parent-of-child leave payment is not provided by the government. It is paid out of the employment insurance fund. The employment insurance fund is the sum of ten and a half hours ' worth of money that employers and employees have saved. It's a fully covered, profit-charge principle. Office worker Lee Seong-kyung (37) said, "" In conclusion, I get my money back, and I don't see why I should be thankful for the benefits, "" adding, "" I still think childcare is a personal matter. "" The employment insurance fund has limits. They are already short of funds and go into deficit by 2020 and by 2025, the deficit will grow to 2.6 trillion won. And another role of employment insurance, such as job security and job training, can be shaken if funds are shaken. In order to get the benefits of parental leave to soar, the government should finally step up its efforts. Still, it supports employment insurance through the budget, but it costs 90 billion won, too little for the total amount of childcare leave allowance (2017). As the welfare burden is growing, one might ask, "" Should I give my maternity leave payment? "" But now is not the time to fix the problem with a little change. If the government regards paternity leave as a "" better inducement "" than the worst possible prevention of childbirth, it should take a much more aggressive approach. Furthermore, solutions to low fertility should be viewed as an investment that maintains a productive population and raises taxpayers in the future. Office worker Park Jong-yeol (36) says, "" The government, which provides wages to private workers due to the minimum wage increase, will pay for the money, "" and "" What's the big deal? "" The government has invested about 3 trillion won in general accounting starting this year, and has provided 130,000 won per month for each worker at the construction site with less than 30 employees. They say they will ease the burden of a steep minimum wage increase, but they won't have to spend it if they didn't "" spike "" in the first place. With three trillion won, you could at least not say, "" I can't take paternity leave because of the financial burden. "" Second, you need to make it mandatory to take time off from work for childcare. But it is hard to break it with the law. We can not force our parents to follow us blindly, because the circumstances are different. It's also a big financial burden. But businesses can do it themselves. They say, "" Male employees must take paternity leave. "" Where is this company? I have it. Lotte Group said men are required to take at least one month of childcare leave starting in 2017. The first month also gives you an identical salary. Over 1000 employees took paternity leave a year ago. Among all childcare leave, 45 % of the men are now. "" We have absolutely no reason to be cautious, since we are all working together, "" said a company employee who declined to be named. Students at Daddie School, a Lotte Group men's childcare leave program, pose. Most of all, you need a shift in common sense. Office worker Lee Da-un recently stated in a department chat room, ' Let's take a winter vacation. OOO February 19-23. ' He said, "" Don't pay any attention to it, set a date for the vacation, "" and then the director announced his schedule. Actually, this is not a place to clap. Vacation is an individual worker's right, and it shouldn't be restricted. Still, a lot of the office workers didn't live up to it. "" Have what you want to eat. I'm black bean noodles. "" "" You can leave when you have time. I have some work left to do. The director, the section chief, and the section chief should change for childcare. Child leave, especially male paternity leave, is an option, not a "" brave choice. "" Start thinking, "" We used to grow three or four, but that's one big fuss about it, "" or, "" How can a girl raise a baby like that? "" Now, when you think about it in your head, you don't just say the same thing, you don't make a good boss. Sejong = Jang Won-seok, journalist Jang.won.wonseok Joongang.co.crt."
"▽ Chinese Microscopic Dusts Retricate Effect = `` Use your opinion on environmental improvement projects '' = It is not too late to apply to the ‘ ordinary … ordinary … expert … ’ notice on the morning transportation stop in the nearby Seoul Metropolitan Government Park Cho-rong, a reporter for the Seoul Metropolitan Government, introduced free transportation measures to reduce fine dust on the first day of this year, and the results of the free transportation measures against the city government have received lukewarm reactions. As the number of passengers using public transportation has not increased significantly, the effects were also insignificant. As ultrafine dust is forecast to be bad for two consecutive days, the Seoul Metropolitan Government ordered Sunday at 5:10 p.m. to cut down on micro-dust emergencies in Seoul. As a result, Seoul buses and subways were exempt from starting on the first train on July 15 until 9 a.m. There is no charge for the 6 to 9 p.m. quitting time. It is the first time that public transportation in Seoul has been free due to the emergency reduction of dust. However, many citizens who have made the first free ride question the effectiveness of the policy, which costs an estimated five to six billion won per day. The free transportation policy is designed to help the Seoul Metropolitan Government pay the citizens ’ bus and subway fares as a tax. Park Min-jung (30), who lives in Naegok-dong, Seocho-gu, said, It is a huge sum of money to pay for public transportation that the city government should pay, rather than thanks, but I felt a lot about paying taxes. Park said, I would rather use the money for the needy or for environmental improvement projects. Some say that the Seoul government gave the wrong treatment without touching the basic solution because the fine dust is from China. Driver-in-the-Changing Director Kim Ji-san of Gangseo-gu, said, "" Just because car owners can use public transportation for free, it won't cost subway and bus drivers a free ride. "" Seoul City Instructs Traffic in a Free Urban Micro-Sprush Transit The continuing "" normal "" levels of ultrafine dust levels during the morning of superdoo82@yna.co.kr and on Monday morning also hurt public sympathy. Seoul fine dust emergency reduction measures indicate that the average concentration of ultrafine dust (PM 2.5) is ' bad ', with levels of more than 50 ㎍ ㎥p lower from midnight to 4:00 p.m., and the next day is similarly ' bad '. The average concentration of ultrafine dust on day 14 (midnight - 4 pm) was 57 ㎍ / / ㎥, exceeding the assigned standard of 50 ㎍ / ㎥. However, the concentration of ultrafine dust in Seoul was less than 50 ㎍ / / ㎥ and higher than 58 ㎍ / ㎥ as of 2 p.m., from early morning to 1:00 p.m. Environmental policy should be based on environmental science and technology, and despite the lack of fine dust forecast accuracy, the Seoul Metropolitan Government did not rush to introduce free transportation policies, said Kim Dong-sul, a professor at Kyung Hee University. Once implemented, it will cost an astronomical amount of money, so we need to consider not only the social value but also the economics of the policy, Kim stressed. ▽ People and mayors of Seoul = Yonhap News Agency = Participants and Park Won-soon share their opinions at the Seoul Citizen Micro-Dollar Exhibition Center held on May 27, 2004 in Gwanghwamun Square, Seoul. The forum, organized by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, attracted more than 3,000 citizens, including housewives, children, experts, and environmental activist groups, to discuss their priorities and specific alternatives. Kim Do-hun, a reporter at the Seoul Yonhap News Agency, said, "" Seoul citizens share their opinions at Gwanghwamun Plaza on May 27 last year. The forum, organized by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, attracted more than 3,000 citizens, including housewives, children, experts, and environmental activist groups, to discuss their priorities and specific alternatives. The Seoul Metropolitan Government announced in early June last year that it would make public transportation free on a dusty day of June 27, 2008. The move was based on a discussion by 3,000 participants at a forum on fine dust citizens at Gwanghwamun Plaza last May. "" There were seven serious levels of fine dust in the city, "" Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said at the forum, "" but the bottom line is that the city is worth 25 billion won more than it is worth when it comes to its free transportation policies. "" Free transportation for the public was introduced to Paris, France, but was eliminated at the beginning of last year. If the air pollution levels, including fine dust concentration, exceed the threshold level, the city government issued two subtitle vehicles, bus and subway, and also rented the free Autoliv and Electric Vehicle rental systems using its free Autolib. However, starting last year, despite the high level of air pollution, public transportation was not operated for free. Instead, they sell tickets for free on buses and subways for 3.8 euros (940 won) in the Seoul metropolitan area. chopark@yna.co.kr"
"CBS News Show for Kim Hyun-jung - Not to relax from the NIS, need to concentrate on overseas - Public Service Agency Director Ok Sang-ok? "" 86 % support "" - Police, receiving a lot of concessions and responsibility - 2001~07MB, And the relative hypertrophy of the police is that it will control power by splitting itself apart. Well, it's not easy to understand when I tell you. Let's take a look at the specific changes, and some of the concerns that arise. I was a judge. Let's connect with Dubull fisherman's Rep. Park Bum-gye. Hello, Congressman Park Beomgye. Hello, Park Bum-gye Nice to meet you. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > How do you assess National Assemblyman Park? Whose son bakppeomgye > so to do the evaluation. I literally ‘It declares the sovereignty of people.’ in the operation of state affairs Moon Jae-in ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Hear, Support. Since liberation from the rule of thumb, there has always been a group of power elite who have been allied to political power. So right after liberation, we had a police era, under the Syngman Rhee administration. And then, after the military regime of 5.16, it went into the era of inspection. Moon Jae-in, these agencies ' authority between the authority to reallocate power from the government does not permit abuse of authority through checks and balances. I say this declaration. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Let's take a look at it. First of all, how can you reduce the power of the NIS? The NIS's counterintelligence of an anti-air investigation is handed over to the police. Now is it that the NIS is only supposed to inform North Korea and gather information from abroad? Park Bum-gye > Yes. There are many things that are too important for the original North and overseas countries, rather than the point of reducing our strength. It's already become a global era. In the middle of the day, we have this age of information, transportation, and communication that can travel around the world. Therefore, if the NIS focuses only on North Korea and abroad, it can not intervene in domestic politics or the investigation of the Grand National Party to the other side, then it will be transferred to the police. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > The main opposition point of the Free Korea Party was this point. The NIS's key function is to investigate the public, except for that, it should be dismantled. And since the intelligence of police can not compare with NIS so far in this field, can they handle it? What do you think? The organization that managed the National Intelligence Service's existing counterintelligence investigation is not lost. Basically, we do all the intelligence and information services that would have been the precondition for an anti-Communist investigation. In the following stages, the so-called investigation or investigation for judicial proceedings is transferred to police. Already police have equipped themselves with anti-air investigations. Of course, there has been abuse of authority. So that is how it should be perceived : It is closing some sort of NIS statement, which I think is a little bit less clear. I think I can convince enough. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Does that mean that it wouldn't matter much to you if the NIS collected information and let the police work with the police to investigate? Mr Backbeomgye : Yes, it is. I think you said it correctly. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > can be persuaded. Let's go to the prosecution. How can the power of prosecutors be subtracted? The Office of Public Officials Corruption, the Office of Public Affairs, becomes an independent body and gives the authority to prosecute. Ladies and gentlemen, the prosecution, which had all the power to prosecute until now, is the first to hand over the power to indict. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. Regarding this, the Korea Party is concerned about the situation. Even if it were to make a water supply company, I would send a hand to it, but I don't think it's the form or something. What do you think? Mr Backbeom : That is already contradictory. Oksang Ok is a roof over the roof. As for the crimes committed by high-ranking officials, the Office of Public Affairs is in charge of them, so it is not possible to have two roofs. Furthermore, since the roof of the past is mentioned as a way of reflecting on its failure to function due to its cozy ties with power, it is a false argument. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Can I convince you of this? The position of the Free Korea Party was very tough, especially in the section of the Department of Commerce and Industry. I do not understand why there is not such a rational argument in the Department of Commerce. Eighty-six percent of the people support it. Moon Jae-in president's approval rating has always to 70 % to 75 % from the president than a high ratio of more than 10 percent reduction. I can convince you enough to see why this is not really a rational argument when you go to it, but the committee members have a different expectation than the judge advocate, including the secretary of our new committee. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > with expectations. Why do you think you're against it, the Department of Commerce and Industry. Do you think there is another reason? Whose son bakppeomgye > to express yesterday two, according to Carl, this is or president is taking control of all, those fears, not the same. I think it is such a concern that can be completely eliminated with good engineering. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Okay. But now that Park is here, she can get a text message from listeners. As the NIS and the prosecution have been forced to resign, the power of the police has increased. Is the police really safe from corruption? I'm worried about this. What do you think? Park Bum-gye : Of course. I have great concern. Same here. The movie 1987, which is currently very popular, reveals such vivid historical facts. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > from there. In fact, the police are almost always partners. Yes, sir. Therefore, there is a major premise in adjusting the power of the prosecution and police. It's the introduction of the local police system. The other is the separation of so-called investigative and administrative police. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Breaking up. Would you like to split the inner force from the outside? If you go to the Park Bum-gye > 2012, it would have been December 16, 2012. Such suspicions are growing that Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency Commissioner Kim Yong-pan applied what he called the pressure to Suseo Police Station, preventing search and seizure. I don't think I can do that. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > But this is what the police say. How effective is it in reality to divide the police? The truth is, the investigating police will be involved in administrative processes, and they will be able to cross lines like this. What do you think? Mr Backbeom : That is what the police say. Getting one requires a lot of concessions and responsibility. I hope you don't become too greedy. I hope the police don't make such a mistake by asking you what you really can get out of this good opportunity. - Also, there are many concerns that if we share the police, the police, and the police, even if we share the police force, can we stop them from becoming monsters by doing so? It introduces a system of checks and balances, separation of authorities, checks and balances within the police force. The other involved upgrading the police commission to a proper watchdog to become a reality. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Finally, the parliamentary special committee on private affairs has a lot to do. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : There are so many. We also have to make up for the shortcomings in the presidential office's reform package. Chang Je-won, secretary of the Free Korea Party, said, What would happen if Cheong Wa Dae dropped its guidelines first? This is just to disable the private board, isn't it? This roadmap has been closed since the National Intelligence Service (NIS) launched last June and July. This president, the head of a kind of administration and president's secretary, secretary for civil affairs, emphasized to. Virtually before running the prosecutor-general, and Moon Jae-in and I emphasis on national policy and administrative direction of the government. So don't worry about what kind of guidelines this presents -- it's time for Congress. The National Assembly is here now. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Okay. You can have a serious discussion. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > should discuss it thoroughly. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Park, I'm meeting you. There is only a little time left for Mr. Park, but let me ask you this one. An investigation into Darth Vader is in progress. "" Can we investigate the MB? "" "" That's the question. I don't have much time left. Evidence of MB, do you have any new evidence? The police department > now has a blitz on search and seizure and evidence appears to be properly collected. According to the people who spoke to the prosecutors ' office, the two very important people involved with the program are the dozen. It appears that the motivation for entering the company in 2001 and 2008 was determined with the permission of MB. Of course, this is not what I heard from the investigating agencies. I heard it from the person who made the statement. So, what do you mean? Did you say you got a job because you were allowed MB to get a job? If the world's not connected to the dozen, that would be out of the question. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Did you testified that your final permission for entering the company had dropped from MB? I understand that there is such a statement as Park Bum-gye > 2001 and 2008. Two different people. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > 200"
"Are they still working in the year 2008? Mr Backbeomgye : It is as if one is. I don't think there's one. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Their statement was a statement of that effect, in which MB was actually a self-assertiveness, in this sense. His statements appear to be the very basis of the prosecution's investigation, as they are very specific and very, very direct. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Please introduce something very specific to me. You didn't just get permission to join the company, you got a little bit more? I heard specific details. But in the investigation is now in full swing and so understand a little something to tell you this ... ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Then Park, when you hear about that profile was.You can't do it It's like when you hear in common parlance ‘ppaebak’ mb is Lee Myung-bak, former owner didn't pause to ask you feel that I can only be president? I heard about 6 things. I decided to investigate these contents to this extent because they are concrete, timely and context reinforced proofs. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I will check it here. Thank you. Thank you very much. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : I was a judge. Dubul was a fisherman's representative, Park Bum-gye.

In addition, if the actual people around you see a virtual money investment story, it could lead to imitative investment. Although I don`t believe in all the certificates on virtual currency gains on the Internet, I still wonder if I should invest them now.

Kwak Geum-ju, a psychology professor at Seoul National University, said, "" People in their 20s and 30s did not perceive virtual money investment like Bitcone as speculation, so they collected information faster than others and then made money from their own diagnosis. "" That is why they claim to have made a lot of money with virtual currency, as they used to hide from their neighbors even when they were making big money. Kwak said, "" As others are doing so, the problem is the psychology of being swayed by movement like ' bent ears ' when people say they have succeeded. "" Some say that the popularity of virtual currency among young people is due to the socio-economic structure. Economics professor Kim Jeong-sik at Yonsei University explained, "" The reason young people are crazy about virtual money is because of the social and economic structures that are so wide apart in wealth that they can not afford to buy a house by collecting salaries. "" Although the virtual currency boom is hardly considered sensible, there are no other ways to raise the Korean economy for the younger generation. But it is hard for the government to ignore the effects of allowing virtual currency transactions altogether, making it difficult for the government to explain why it is so young, which is why it is necessary to regulate virtual currency. comma@yna.co.kr"
"- 7,000 on average daily basis ... less than 20,000 employees. - 3 shifts and more than 50 hours....The rural workforce is worse off. - Only 2 men work in fire fighting.Fire fighting force is increasing every year. However, the fire department is far from sufficient to meet the growing demand for fire fighting and annual mobilization due to urbanization. The shortage of human resources is becoming serious as people move out of Seoul and its metropolitan areas. It is pointed out that a lack of fire department staff is urgently needed because it is a threat to the lives of the public, such as the Jecheon fire disaster. In a related Moon Jae-in, the president visited Seoul Yongsan Fire Station in June last year “A lack of more than 19,000 people in the legal standard of his tenure of fire to increase staffing.” high.Said. ◇ Rise in number of annual services…Firefight personnel are classified into three types of fire rescue or rescue emergency activities. The Small Fire Force Status statistics show that the number of annual fire brigades for firefighting from 2012 to 2016 remained at an annual level of 42,000. Meanwhile, the number of rescue operations surged from 536,199 in 2013 to 756,987 in 2016. The number increased by 42.4 percent (225,888 cases) four years ago. The number of emergency services is also soaring to 2,156,488 in 2012, 2,243,9211 in 2013, 2,349,111 in 2014, 2,054,451,741 in 2015, and 2,677,749 last year. The average daily attendance of firefighters last year amounted to 7,000. Fire-fighting staff is also on the increase every year, but it is not enough given the rapidly growing number of fire fighters being sent in. According to the Fire Administration Data and Statistics in 2016, the fire service workforce increased steadily from 31,000 in 2008 (3.3 %) to 37,826 (4.2 %) in 2011 and 41,121 in 2016. As of 2016, however, only 34,260 firefighters have worked in the field among the total number of firefighters. However, under the Framework Act on Fire Services, the optimal number of employees who are engaged in field activities according to the criteria for the deployment of service personnel by fire station or fire engine is 57,174. The quota is less than the minimum number of workers required by law by 10,924. If one firefighter breaks down a fire due to lack of human resources, the lack of workers will lead to a heavy workload on firefighters. According to fire department officials, the average workweek for fire department firefighters is fifty hours or more on a three-shift basis. Although 3-shift shifts are the rule for fire stations, many of them work in two shifts due to poor conditions such as labor problems. Small fire stations in rural areas do not only lack the human resource but also have a larger area to manage, making it difficult to extinguish fires or forest fires. As it is a rural area and we need to deal with larger areas of land, we can`t afford to do anything with larger fires. Even with other fire department support, it takes a long time to get there because it is too far. One firefighter in Gangwon Province also said, "" It took at least one operator and at least two fire fighters to drive a pump car from a local 119 center. "" Because of the fact, the fire control system required at least four people to operate in the countryside, and it requires a small fire control system. Firemen who have turned black since the fire was put out. 99 percent of firefighters are local government officials who are controlled and overseen by local governments. Each local government will receive the total amount of its personnel to be spent on local government employees from the budget authorities and voluntarily determine the size and type of its workforce within the total amount of labor paid. It is a total labor cost system. Fire prevention department professor Lee Young-joo of Seoul National University said, Although the fire department is absolutely lacking in personnel, it is a difficult structure for firefighters to voice their voices in the process of securing funds. With a limited budget and many areas to spare, the increase in fire department is left in the background for local branch offices. As we have to reduce the number of other civil servants due to the increase in the fire department, it is hard for heads of local governments to make a decision on the increase.Lee added that although the government has the money to pay fire prevention authorities, it is mainly used to replace equipment and pay more workers when local governments are in bad shape. If there is internal training or sick leave or childcare leave, we can`t replace them immediately, said an official at the Seoul Fire & Disaster Administration, who would need at least one day to recruit children. We need to secure alternative personnel, such as operating period-related staff like teachers, but it is virtually impossible to secure them in the current employment system. Kim Bo-young ((kby5848@edaily.co.kr) ⓒ gyeongje), Information Media Idal-Dong, a virtual currency exchange in Da-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul, looks at the bulletin board yesterday morning. Kim Nak-jung, a reporter at the Korea Virtual Monetary Exchange, will continue to announce its plan to minimize the resistance of investors by 3 million won. As a result, the financial authorities will also investigate the possibility of excessive losses caused by the joint investigation. In particular, it reaffirmed its market principle of self-responsibility by making it clear that virtual currencies are not the legal currency that the government is responsible for, along with strong anti-speculation measures.◇ Korea Exchange closure is a responsibility to take long-term measures, and investment is a responsibility for self-investment = The government's stance on this day was sparked by confusion surrounding the Special Law Act, which was adopted by Justice Minister Park Sang-kee on July 11. The close of the exchange remained a deterrent to long-term speculation, minimizing resistance from estimated 3 million virtual currency investors, while maintaining a critical compromise on virtual currency transactions.The government announced yesterday that it will pursue the real-name policy on virtual currency without interruption, while emphasizing individual responsibility for investment, as a measure to minimize side effects when bubbles arise. The government needs to be cautious in determining the extraction, investment and sale of virtual currency under its own responsibility, as no one can guarantee the value of any of them. This is interpreted as the government giving out clear signals to the extent that they do not impair the free flow of investment in the market. Financial Services Commission Chairman Choe Jong-koo told the Government Seoul`s Office in a briefing on his plan to push for financial reform on the day, As shown by the wisdom of saying, `` It is every case that overheated speculation is not causing any harm to stability. '' The series of comments by high-ranking government officials is not a sign that the government will pull out of the spotlight on the side effects of overheated speculation, but rather a strategy to minimize the possible side effects. However, Minister Park, who said, "" We have finished coordination with government agencies, "" can not avoid being embarrassed. It is still a mystery whether Minister Park's remarks were not coordinated and went too far by his own remarks, or whether he was insulted by the unexpected strong opposition from the mayor by Cheong Wa Dae.◇ The government will deal sternly with any wrongdoing involving dealing with the stock market, money laundering and tax evasion. The intensive investigation has been predicted to be carried out through joint investigations by prosecutors, police, the National Tax Service and financial authorities. First of all, he is urged not to tolerate attempts to undermine the autonomy of the market, as it is expected to cause large-scale damages if illegal forces abuse the money in the face of the boom in virtual currency investment. Some say that the government will use the joint investigation as a tool to cool down the speculative frenzy and to pressure the stock exchange into using a stronger force.

"(Data photo). / News 1 ─ News 1 Min Kyung-seok : It is similar to common year in March. However, there will be some day when the temperature falls slightly by large margins. The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) predicted on February 15 that the temperature would change significantly due to the effects of the continental and migratory high atmospheric pressure on the peninsula. Temperatures will be similar to or higher than usual, but as the cold continental high atmospheric pressure expands, it can occasionally drop slightly.Average temperatures are forecast to be 20 % lower than usual (0.4 to - 1.8 degree), 50 % on similar days, and 30 % on higher days. That means only about 5.6 out of 28 days are colder than usual. Rainfall is forecast to be 30 percent less than average (19.2 to 41.5 ㎜), 50 percent on similar days, and 20 percent on many days.In addition, due to high pressure, it is often clear and dry day, and snow may fall by geographical influence due to low atmospheric pressure or north-easterly inflow. We expect similar or higher weather conditions to the average year in February, said an official at the Korea Meteorological Administration, however, with the forecast winter weather conditions could lower than forecast or cause more snow to fall. January 29th to February 4th, the first week of February, will have clear and dry days due to continental high pressure. The temperature is similar to the average year or a little below and the precipitation will be less than during the same period. The second and third owners of the two provinces, Feb. 5-11 and February 12-8, are subject to continental and migratory high atmospheric pressure, so the temperature change will be very large. The temperature and precipitation are expected to be similar to an average year. The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) predicted that the weather would continue to be similar to the average year in March. However, due to the temporary high atmospheric pressure on the continent, it can sometimes be chilly. "" March was forecast to have 30 % lower days than usual (5.5 ~ 6.3), 50 % on similar days and 20 % on higher days.

We will make a decision after sufficient discussion and coordination at the government office in Seoul on the future, Jeong Ki-jun, head of the economic coordination department at the Cabinet Office, told a briefing Friday. This is a little bit less of a loosening of his strong stance on the virtual currency exchange, compared with Justice Minister Han Sang-kee's statement on July 11 that he even aims to close the exchange. Co-represident of the Association of Block Chainings Kim Jin-hwa said, The government has dared to pull back on the exchange, saying, If closed, our regulations will be stronger than in China, so it will be closed. The more a problem is that banks are not involved in the real-name system for virtual currency transactions, Kim said, adding, We should apply what the banks have tested to prevent market confusion. Jeong Ki-jun, Minister of Economic Affairs and Coordination (Yonhap news), is about to announce his position on July 15 at the government office in Seoulcheong, Seoul. He added, If the government has courageously withdrawn and banks also participate in the real-name verification, the exchange should also fulfill its social responsibility, adding, The association will step up to form an independent regulatory committee. The nation's largest virtual currency exchange, Bi sseom, said it is pleased that the government expressed its willingness to communicate with the market, and stated as an example that it would actively cooperate with the government's policies and comply with the Exchange-level voluntary regulations. The government seems to have made a wise choice, said a Coin Nuist official. I think the industry needs to regulate speculation and misconduct, said Counnest, adding, Investment in research and development in block chains is the most welcome message on the exchange. pseudojm@yna.co.kr and the reporter's inquiry and 1:1 chatting are the effects of the real name transaction system on the virtual currency market as Seoul = New York City and the Gongnyang are about to be adopted. Analysts say that although the volume of transactions is expected to be decreased in some cases right now, it will directly or indirectly affect the stabilisation of the market and the stabilization of speculative demand in the medium and long term.The government announced its stance on virtual currency on July 15, and announced that it would proceed with the real-name policy system for virtual currency transactions, which was unveiled on July 28. The Financial Services Commission also stated that it has no problem with the cooperation of banks, which had emerged as a variable,. Accordingly, it is expected that the real-name transaction system will be adopted as early as the end of this month.Once the real-name transaction system is in full operation, distribution of illicit funds, such as hiding profits from criminals, will no longer be allowed to take place. The industry believes that illegal transactions were made. The real-name system is likely to eliminate much of the demand. In the long run, it is also expected to help catch overheated speculation demands.Unlike the current situation, when it is difficult to figure out who trades in any way, it is possible to know how transactions are made after the introduction of the real-name system. This makes it easier for authorities to come up with more detailed and effective anti-speculation measures.Tax discussion is expected to gain further momentum as the materials identified under the real-name system can be used. Many believed that the imposition of taxes on virtual currency transactions would help lower the domestic virtual currency, which is more expensive than the international market.Economic science professor at Yonsei University Sung Tae-yoon said, We can`t fully catch speculation with a real-name transaction, however, when we learn about different forms of regulation and how transactions are made using real-name systems, based on various forms of speculation.Meanwhile, a decline in trade is expected immediately after the introduction. However, the industry believes that it will make more profit by boosting the stability of the transaction in the mid to long-term.An industry insider said, "" Even though we estimate that 10 to 20 % less of existing transactions will be made before and after the actual implementation of the real-name system. "" However, the transaction of virtual currency with real name would become healthier in the medium to long term.

"Major smartphone makers have been showing signs of face since the beginning of this year. As Apple faces a string of troubles around the world with its ' Battery Gate ', consumers are growing more concerned about Samsung's next film ' Galaxy S9. ' LG Electronics has resumed its overall business strategy, including the scheduled launch of its new product line and the name of the brand.◇ Samsung's ` Gall S9 ` is about to make a competitive crisis positive = Samsung Electronics is set to launch its new Mobile World Congress (MWC) mobile phone in Barcelona in late February. Consumers can expect this product from the new smartphone brand that represents the Android operating system. Foreign news reports and social networking site postings containing estimated specifications and images have been appearing since the end of last year.The disclosure at MWC 2018 was a result of Samsung's complete victory over the ignition and sterilization of its Galaxy Note 7 battery in the second half of 2016. Due to the return of new product disclosure and release schedules, Samsung Electronics first unveiled its new Galaxy S product at MWC by 2016, but its first new Galaxy S product was released to the public in London at the end of March last year. It was a strategy to secure additional time to increase product maturity and attract global consumers.The situation in which rival companies face a crisis is favorable for Samsung. Apple is in trouble with sending out mobile phones from the U.S., South Korea, France and Israel after it was revealed that Apple secretly updated its old iPhones to slow them down. LG Electronics, which was scheduled to unveil its next film at MWC 2018, is reviewing its launch date from scratch.◇ Apple's "" Super Cycle "" worries about slipping away, running out of customers, and the battery gate Apple asked for has dampened the expectation that iPhone sales will hit an all-time high this year. IPhone's sales are expected to reach a record high this year as many of its iPhone 6Gb/s buyers are expected to replace their iPhones by 2014 to 2015.But not only did the iPhone 8·X sales fall short, the price reduction that Apple offered to replace the battery as a reward for battery gates inevitably reduces the demand for a new iPhone. Apple announced a measure to compensate 50 dollars (66,000 won) to replace the iPhone battery by the end of the year, down from 79 dollars to 29 dollars.A bigger problem is that Apple's compensation measures are still subject to a series of lawsuits from around the world. The company's image is inevitably damaged due to a serious blow to consumer confidence. Some worry that Apple could shed its loyal customer base, which led to its rapid growth.◇ LG Electronics is set to reestablish its smart phone business strategy. LG Electronics Vice Chairman Cho Seong-jin told a press conference at the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2018, I don`t want to change the way anyone can release new smartphones for a set time. It also warned of a drastic change in business strategy, with the possibility of changing the brand of smartphones such as the ` G ` and ` V `.It is said that it will review the origin of its strategy to seek a rebound in the long-depressed smartphone business. It is a step to recognize the failure of the previous business strategy and seek to overcome the crisis. The MC business department in charge of the smartphone business has been in the red for 11 consecutive quarters from the second quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of last year.As LG Electronics begins to regain its business strategy, it is highly likely that the launch of new products will be delayed for a considerable time. Although positive in terms of cost management, such as marketing, it is highly possible that it will negatively affect the market share due to the absence of new products and the gap in the product replacement cycle. LG Electronics has so far shown a new premium phone line from the G and V series in the second half. She said, "" It is impossible to live on a salary basis from elementary school, but she paid 2.5 times more than other investors in return for her share investment. Park said, "" Even for big businesses, the annual salary is 40 to 50 million won, and it is only a small amount of money to raise a house with the utmost care and care, "" adding, "" It is hard to think of switching to the upper-middle-class because it blocked our investment path. ""Kim (26), a senior at university, also invested five million won (46,000,000 U.S. dollars) in Bitcone, a part-time job that was collected. I was ready to get a job, but now that the reality is not clear, I really wanted to make some money and make a strong backstop, "" Kim said. "" If the world isn't about to end up with an image of having a big family and connections, I wouldn't have any money to go.Even considering closing the Virtual Monetary Exchange on July 11 was among the young people in their 20s and 30s who protested most fiercely against Justice Minister Bahk Sang-kee. Because they are leading the way in investing virtual currency, the nation's largest virtual currency exchange, the Korea Exchange, surveyed more than 4,100 users in November last year, showed that 29 percent of respondents were in their 20s and 30s, respectively.A popular analysis suggests that the Bitcone Rush is a time when the ladder for rising stairs disappear. It is the last row of children who can escape from the earth. Young people face the reality that while suffering from student loan payments, the jobless rate for the youth has soared to its lowest level since the foreign exchange crisis and that they can find a home even if they find a job. The generation of Sampo, which refers to the youth who had to give up on three things : love, marriage, and childbirth, is now being extended to the N-force generation, which has to give up limitless N branch. The only option is to invest in virtual currency, which is expected to bring quick, get-rich-quick benefits to young people in a world that is becoming socio-economic and dry. It is as if every time a 23-year-old, who made 28 billion won by investing 80,000 won, is shown in the media, he becomes enthusiastic and hopeful."" People in their 20s and 30s fiercely competed with each other from their childhood, but when they saw the hard work and the inheritance of wealth, it is the only generation that has ever seen such young people pay with their own eyes, "" said sociology professor Shin Kwang-young.Investing in virtual currencies is also seen as an equal opportunity open to everyone. Woo-mo (29), an office worker who has been investing three years in Bit-Coin, said, "" Virtual bills, like real estate speculation or equity investment, can go in without a huge investment barrier, without having to know anything about land or businesses. ""Therefore, reckless regulations on virtual currency investment inevitably lead to opposition from older generations. Older generations who enjoyed the fruits of the development era seem to think they are now trying to deprive the younger generation of investment opportunities. The reaction of high-ranking officials as the virtual currency bubble has been seen on the Internet community since the government`s restriction is the same as the larger asset prices for multiple homeowners.Since young investors say they are making money out of the exchange when class ladders have never been closed like this, it is hard for them to say that they are making money out of the exchange, said Gu Jeong-woo, a sociology professor at Sungkyunkwan University. Kwak Geum-joo, a psychology professor at Seoul National University, also explained to the youths, "" Bitcone tries to become a dragon in Gaecheon by introducing himself to change the environment, but all of a sudden he had to do is to control himself. "" There is also a view of concern. Although I fully understand that young people are flocking to virtual currency investment, it is problematic to lose the motivation to work and to see an increase in the climate of class growth at once, Gu added.Kim Hyung-jun, a reporter for the Korea Virtual Monetary Exchange, passed by on July 14 in front of a virtual currency exchange bulletin board, which displays the closing price of household bills such as the Hong Kong correspondent, Kwak Joo-hyeon, Hankookio.com.

"Tax refund by 10 % for used cars … Must pay extra 300 thousand won for children's lessons, pay extra tax to be eligible for family credit? (Sejong = Combined news), and could it be a bonus for tax holders because they could afford to pay double tax even in a web browser? The National Tax Service's year-end tax payment simplification service will start on July 15. (Yonhap news agency) Lee Ji-eun, a reporter at the tax office in Seoul, said on July 12, "" Prepare for the Year-end tax payment. "" 2017 2018.1.12 jieunlee@yna.co.kr workers can access the year-end settlement simplification service starting at 8:00 a.m. and inquire the income and tax deduction data. Starting this year, additional materials including tuition fees for tuition loans, tuition fees for elementary, middle, and high school experience lessons, and credit cards were purchased. The amount of student loans collected from the Korea Scholarship Foundation is inquired into the income and tax credit data of the person who obtained the loan. If a child has a loan, it can not be inquired by a parent's deduction. As one of the regular curriculum for elementary, middle, and high schools, the expense for on-site learning can be deducted by paying 300,000 won per student. Starting 2017, when purchasing used cars with credit cards or other credit cards, 10 percent of the purchase amount will be provided by simplified services, including the amount of income deductions with credit cards. If the medical expense deduction data are not inquired at the end-of-year settlement simplification service, one can report it to the medical expense reporting center by July 17. Health care institutions requested to modify must submit their data by 18th, and workers can access the finally revised medical expense data from 20th. If the end-of-year settlement does not want to become a tax bomb, it is important to avoid overdeduction, just as to keep the documents carefully. If you accidentally get more deductions, you may face a failure to pay a surcharge. The majority of mistakes in the end-of-the-year settlement process are the over-deduction of dependents. A single dependent can not be deducted for having more than one worker redundant. It should also be remembered that the spouse and dependent family whose annual income exceeds one million won (five million won in total wage when they have only their working income) can not be eligible for basic deductions. The medical expenses that are preserved in the in-house labor welfare fund, loss of loss of income, and the national health insurance corporation among the medical expense data provided can not receive a tax credit. Education expenses are also not subject to tax deductions for tuition provided by the in-house labor welfare fund, or scholarships from schools or workplaces. The data for simplifying the year-end settlement of dependents need to be agreed in advance to provide the information. However, if the dependent family members are under 19 years old, born on January 1, 1999, they can inquire into minors without any consent. The consent can be given online or via mobile, and workers who can not use the computer can apply directly at the tax office. Starting from the end of this year, the simplified services can be used not only in Internet Explorer but also in browsers such as chromium and Safari. If you visit the National Tax Consultative Center (126) or the National Tax Service (nationwide), you can get advice on how to use the tax money at home and how to pay it. The National Tax Service (NTS) said, "" Since there are many home tax users who use the first day of the service, convenient starting date of the year-end settlement service, and VAT declaration start and closing dates of 22nd and 25th, access to the tax may be delayed. "" rock@yna.co.kr According to the Nihon Geizai Shimbun on July 15, more than 1,500 damages and damages counseling concerning virtual currency were received at the Japanese National Center for Life from April to December last year. What has come to the fore lately is the mining consultation. It is not expensive virtual currency, it is the first time it is extracted, "" and "" you can mine it easily at home, "" and it is an expensive device or device that represents it. However, it is known that it is impossible to make virtual currency extraction without highly specialized knowledge. It is better not to sign a mining contract unless you understand the virtual currency system very well, said an official at the center. One male office worker in his 40s, according to the actual center, said through an email magazine, I will introduce a project to mine virtual currencies. Surely a stable profit "" was received by the advertisement. "" When you turn on the app on your smartphone, it automatically begins to extract, and you can get more virtual calls, "" the advertisement said. The man spent 100,000 yen (about 960,000 won) on buying the app, but he lost the money without getting any virtual currency. In some cases, they were caught using non-ownership computers such as universities to mine virtual money. A private university in the metropolitan area of Japan found that 30 computers in its computer room had a hidden mining program built in mid-December. Schools warned students who installed the program by tracking them down. Other computers were caught hacking into computer parts to secretly build mining programs.Japan has acknowledged virtual currency as a payment method since April last year through a revision of the Financial Telecommunications Act. Instead, the virtual currency exchange operators were required to register and explain their services to protect their users and avoid money laundering, while the users were required to provide public certificates, including licenses, to grasp their personal information. As of October last year, 11 virtual currency exchanges were registered with the Financial Services Administration as virtual currency exchanges. The Financial Services Administration should make frequent announcements on the registration companies and their virtual currencies it handles to prevent consumer damages. Users should provide public certificates for their own verification when opening an account for the first time, exchange virtual currency and cash transactions of more than two million yen, or transfer of virtual currency of more than 100,000 yen. From such identified personal information, the suspected parties to the fund laundering are reported to the National Police Agency, which is in charge of the affairs of the Financial Information Analyst (FIU) in Japan. According to the National Police Agency, the money laundering using some 170 BitTeckes cases in April last year, when the virtual currency was accepted as a payment method, was reported as a suspicious transaction, or STR. According to the Korean Embassy in Japan's Virtual Monetization report, about 30 percent of the world`s Bitcons transactions take place in Japan. In 2016, the volume of the Bitcone exchange transactions reached 2.08 trillion yen, but last year, it exceeded 8 trillion yen, and the volume of transactions rose dramatically. This is also a big influence on the number of places to use such as bit-coining payments at more than 10,000 stores in Japan, including electronics and quantum printing stores and big cameras.Bitcoin's Medal Bitcone, photographed in Dusseldorf, Germany. Pictures by Park Eun-kyung : ' Red Dragon, Pink Butterfly, and Silver Web … ' A colorful anti-smoggy mask is becoming popular in China. China, where masks are a daily necessity due to extreme smog, is showing a move to personalize and upgrade with a distinctive design. Located at Beijing's premium shopping complex Solana, Beijing, there are dozens of expensive masks on average of about 500 yuan (80,000 won). They are all made by hand and look more like fashion items than masks by painting a black or white special cloth with animal patterns or embroidered with animal patterns such as tigers or butterflies. The price of a mask decorated with a web pattern of silver crystals is 699 yuan (about 110,000 won). "" The store clerk said, "" Because it has excellent features and is pretty, you can not usually exchange it with someone who is interested in fashion. The store, which opened late last year, has not yet had a high sales volume, but it has high repeat sales, the clerk hinted. The Chance-based company has four famous shopping malls in Beijing. Mihau Home page, which was founded in 2016, Hanfangwien, a smog mask company, said, "" I don't want to put Chinese characters in a smog protection mask that has Chinese medicine in it. "" Masks with fashion elements sold at prices two to three times higher than other smog masks. Smog protective masks, which are highlighted by the use of fluorescent materials, are also on sale. Global brands such as Vogue, Airlinam and Cambridge Mask have also set up facilities at . or ina in Alibaba, making China a fashionable for fashion masks. China's ultrafine dust prevention mask market (PM 2.5) increased by year to more than 1000 factories last year from just 500 in 2013. Sales volume also more than doubled from 260 million in 2012 to 573 million in 2015. As of July last year, China imported 85.06 million dollars (about 90.4 billion won) from the mask as of July last year, a 17 percent increase from the previous year."
"1. High yield temptation with low interest rates. Move away from the marginalized ants and the stock market. Invest less and less than real estate. IT generation, be confident with future technology, get rid of virtual room. Interest in virtual currency is a global phenomenon, but it is especially so in Korea. According to the industry, the number of virtual currency investors in the nation has already exceeded 3 million. The reason why the nation's young people are becoming enthusiastic about investing in virtual currency is based on an analysis of experts. 1. A 38-year-old office worker said on July 14, "" I haven't paid my savings account with my regular savings account and felt like I was going to pay my senior rates at savings banks, so I have to pay at least 10 % a day. "" The main reasons behind the virtual money frenzy are rich liquidity and a low-interest environment. Since the global financial crisis, the increased amount of available funds has failed to find suitable investment sources amid low interest rates, and is shifting to the high-risk, high-return commodity, virtual currency market. Commercial financial institutions have shown an increase in interest rates on their deposits since the Bank of Korea raised the key interest rate last year, but the average annual rate of interest has remained low at just 1.79 %. Meanwhile, according to Coin Market Cap, a global virtual currency information company, total market value of virtual currency worldwide is $ 725.4 billion. It is more than 45 times larger than a year ago (Jan. 14, 2017 - $ 17.7 billion). Professor Han Ho-hyun at Kyung Hee University said, "" With so much money on the market and no place to go, the expectation of making more money in the short term still did not draw people into the virtual machine. ""2. Song (45), who works for an ant giant alienated from the stock market, last month put 40 million won from stock in five types of virtual currency, including beatcore. Although it made a profit on the bullish KOSPI last year, it has not lost much of its energy with joint buying and selling (an investment that can pay off stocks later). Compared to the stock market, in which the information-deficient ants are likely to prey to commodity, the virtual currency market is considered relatively fair, Song said. Individual investors, who are sick and tired of the stock market's imbalance of information, are also moving to the virtual currency market. Unlike securities firms and institutional investors who dominate information, the stock market can only be what individuals call a tilted playground. Even in the virtual currency market, the word "" whale "" can be swayed, but at least it can not be harmed by commercialism. 3. Last year, apartments in the Gangnam area (based on an area of 84 ㎡) in Seoul increased 200-500 million won. It is not easy to find apartments worth less than 1 billion won in major Seoul areas. Renting a bank loan is also becoming more difficult, making it impossible for people with no money to make any investment in apartments. On the other hand, one can make a virtual money investment with only a few hundred thousand won. Hong Ki-hun, a professor at Hongik University, said, "" Virtual currency transactions are not just about real estate, they are about getting high returns with only a small amount of money, but also about applications, which makes them easy to access and access. ""4. Gamemoney, 29, who works for a state-run game fund and a future technology preference company, recently closed an installment savings account and put 10 million won into the alternative coin, Ripple. When the U.S.'s biggest money transfer company, Monegram, announced that it would partner with Ripple to provide financial payment services, it decided to invest. In Korea, even if we do, it would be more valuable in the long term as the technology is spreading around the world, he said.Like Nam, the generation around the age of 30 in our society is used to game money dealing since they were young. Unlike the previous generation, the analysis shows that they accepted virtual currency as the technology of the new era, allowing them to make investments like games. As the Internet revolution has blown up in the 386 generation, the younger generation sees virtual money as an investment technology in the future, said Kim Jin-hwa, co-president of the Korea Federation of Block Chain. Despite the government's criticism that "" the bubble will burst, "" the growth of the virtual currency market is related to the belief in future technology. 5. PC rooms and the domestic advanced IT environment also contributed to the rapid growth of the virtual currency market. "" These days, we have a lot of PC rooms that can be extracted without receiving customers due to the fact that there are many computers and high-speed networks, "" said Professor Lee Byung-tae of KAIST. We need large capital when new industries start, and the bubble is inevitable, he added, adding that companies like Facebook and Amazon would not have been able to do without the dot-com bubble. "" Talking as if you could separate the bubble from the technological advancement is due to a lack of awareness about what happens when the paradigm changes, "" he said.

"【 Transportation Ministry APNewship ; Water is pouring from the east coast of China onto a Iranian oil tanker Sanchi that is on fire with firefighters. The Sanchi was engulfed in flames after a collision with a Hong Kong freighter on July 6, but sank in the afternoon of July 14. The photo was provided by the Chinese Ministry of Transportation on July 10. ▽ Seoul = As the collision with a Hong Kong freighter on the eastern coast of China, China's oil tanker Sanchi sank, China and other neighboring countries could face the worst pollution. The Chinese government announced on July 14 that Sanchiro went to the mountain and sank completely. According to CCTV reports, the fuel leaked into the sea continued to burn at the scene of the accident even after the Sanchi accident sank. Officials believe that the 13 to 6,000 tons of condensate oil, which was found in Sanch Lake, was spilled over 10 square kilometers. According to a Xinhua news agency report, fire department authorities placed four rescue workers in Sanchi Lake on July 13 to collect two more bodies and secure a navigation log device similar to the black box on airplanes. So far, three people have been confirmed dead. At the time of the accident, 32 Iranian and Bangladesh sailors were on board. The Chinese government said earlier that the Sanchi accident did not produce a large outflow of fuel, and that the container oil on the vessel would evaporate quickly, leaving little harm in the way. However, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) quoted by experts as saying, "" Although the coolant evaporates faster, it can be mixed with water, so it is more difficult to clean up the area (which is why). "" Bloomberg said the accident would be the worst in five decades if all of the coolant released in the Sanchihat Sea is destroyed and burned. The amount of container shipments on the Sanch Lake is larger than the 35,000 tons of Exxon Valdes, which has so far recorded as the worst offshore contamination. The Washington Post also pointed out that if the container ship goes into the sea after sinking, it could cause three times more damage to the ocean than when the Exxon Valdez. East China Sea is a frequent spot for accident as much as be called 'Asia's Bermuda Triangle'. According to the Allianz Report, 34 ships went missing (sunk) here in 2016 alone. As a result, nearly 40 percent of the world`s marine cargo has disappeared. aeri@newsis.com ▶ New Sis Big Data MSI Stock List-Light to the Circulate…Newspaper's Facebook [Twitter] < consensus media news agency, unauthorized reproduction - Redistribution is prohibited.Park Dong-ju, a reporter at Gangnam, Seoul's Yonhap news agency, said, "" As the government tries to secure multiple home owners, apartment prices in some areas, including Gangnam, are skyrocketing. As the excessive heat wave started to develop rapidly at the end of last year, the price of apartments in Gangnam and other metropolitan areas is running short, prompting a steep rise in sales. As the price of apartments in Gangnam has gone up significantly in recent years, the gap between apartments in Seoul and Gangbuk has become wider. After analyzing monthly housing price data of KB Kookmin Bank, the research center analyzed on December 15 that the average apartment price of Gangnam area (11 districts south of the Han River) exceeded 826.9 million won (876.9 million U.S. dollars) last December. Compared to the average apartment price of 568.9 million won in the Gangnam area as of December 2013, the price of apartments in the Gangnam area has risen by 42 percent, or 237.9 million won, over the past four years.

Apartments in Gangbuk took four years to reach 100 million won, but apartments in Gangnam were half in two years and five months (from 568.9 million won in December 2013 to 668.4 million won in May 2016).▽ Rising housing prices in Gangnam area (Seoul = Yonhap news) = Amid the government's efforts to secure multiple home owners, apartment prices in some areas, including Gangnam, Seoul, are skyrocketing. As the excessive heat wave started to develop rapidly at the end of last year, the price of apartments in Gangnam and other metropolitan areas is running short, prompting a steep rise in sales. The photo shows the difference in housing prices between Gangnam and Gangbuk areas in Seoul yesterday. Looking at the gap in the average apartment prices by year, the price difference between the two areas was 880 million won in December 2013, with Gangnam area (568.9 million won) and Gangbuk area (381.1 million won). At the end of 2014, the gap between the two regions widened to 587.74 million won in Gangnam area and 384.4 million won in Gangbuk, only slightly (192 million won). However, the gap widened to 622.51 million won in December 2015 and 411.9 million won in Gangbuk, respectively, to 219.9 million won, and the difference widened to 419.2 million won in December 2016. Last December, the price of apartments due to the housing price hike, especially apartments to be rebuilt in Gangnam, soared to 876.9 million won, while the average apartment price difference in the Gangbuk area widened to 492.9 million won. Yang pointed out that the government's policy to control the price of apartments in Gangnam has rather been a spring effect.Meanwhile, apartments in Gangnam saw their price hikes, the widening gap between apartments in other areas and other areas [manufacturing facilities] were shown. Meanwhile, single-family apartments in the Gangbuk area saw a stronger trend. The average price of single-house apartments in Gangbuk went up 19.5 percent over the past four years from 557.7 million won in December 2013 to 65922 million won last December. Gangnam District rose 17.3 percent to 898.2 million won from 764.7 million won during the same period. Yang said, "" The redevelopment and redevelopment of Gangbuk new towns in the past two to three years resulted in an increase in the value of single-family housing, and after that the trend of rent or reconstruction has been affected by the Seoul Metropolitan Government's exit strategy, an individual house has been either by remodeling or rebuilding. yjkim84@yna.co.kr"
"Interest in Kakao and JoongAng Ilbo Big Data Specialization Vehicles Link to Real Purchase 1st place search "" Stinger "" female imported cars and small-specific SUVs users ranked first place on the list of 50 search engines (most frequently found in the first half) Hyundai Grander IG-generation- jenesiseu 80 Kia Motors Sorento-Donggyong-Chong`s G4 Lexton cars were all in the same class last year. These cars have more in common. Consumers in their 50s were the most searched car online. The JoongAng Ilbo requested Kakao to analyze its search term for the past year. This is the 100-million-unit car query (search term inquiry) and click data retrieved by the user from the instant messaging service Kakao Talk (PC and smartphones) and portal site Daum. When analyzing big data on all vehicles to be released in Korea or to the market, Hyundai Motor Company found the most cars of its 50s last year : Grander IG`s first class sedan. This is in contrast to the fact that she did not appeal much to her 20s (25th). Grander IG`s attention on purchasing power 50s was the best-selling Vest-Celling car in Korea last year. Sales rose 92.2 percent last year from 2016. The same is true of luxury sedan. Last year, the Genesis G0 (41,1567) sold more than the Mercedes-Benz E-Class (36,263), and the E class sold more than the BMW 5 Series (22,420). The frequency of searches in the fifties was exactly the same as these sales figures. People in their 50s were in order of interest in the Genesis 0 (2nd), Mercedes-Benz E-Class (7th), and BMW 5 Series (13th). People in their 20s were more interested in the semi-grade C class (16th) than the quasI-large E class (24th), and those in their 30s preferred the class (5th) to the Group of 80 (14th). It appears that the frequency of searches in the buying power of the 50 cars has actually been linked to the volume of car sales. The most frequently looked at cars last year by car consumers of all ages were Kia Motors Sports Saloon, or Stinger. Stinger was released on May 23 last year, but its 7-months search surpassed the annual search count of all other automobiles. Stinger is the most frequent search tool for people in their 30s (21 %) and 40s (17 %), respectively. However, sales were rather low. Last year (May - December), the cumulative sales of Stinger (6122 units) were 76.5 % of the target (8000 units). Interest in the 30-40s can be interpreted as being not directly linked to actual sales. Those in their 20s searched the most BMW mini-copper (3%-9) among imports. When it comes to women in their 20s, BMW Minicooper ranks first in imports (13 percent). [Graphic : Cha Joon-hong, reporter of small SUV, which saw domestic sales surge last year, also got a hot keyboard and smartphone. The second most valuable search results (Ssangyong Tilbles), fourth (Hyundai Motor Company), 11th (Kia Motors Niro), and 15th (Renault Samsung QM3) are small SUVs. In particular, female consumers visited Ssangyong Motor's FlashRay (52,280 units), which is known to be a small SUV Veste Selling Car (12.5 percent). One out of every four teenagers that women looked for (25 percent) was called Tivoli. Conversely, men rarely searched for Tiboles (46), with Tivoli at the center of conversation (20 % of the total screening) in the first half of last year. In the third quarter, Hyundai Motor surpassed the 11-percent mark. The trend of the amount of color tests is also directly related to the sales volume. Last year, the number of nose or pants sold between August and November was larger than the number of the people who sold the song "" Tibook""by "" 10,7292. "" As Hyundai's union continued its strike in the year-end, the company sold more of its 4,485 units in December than the 2,288 cars. The hottest issue in the fourth quarter of last year was the jenesiseu0, a semi-centered sports sedan for Genesis. Since its launch in September last year, the 7070 was the number one search frequency (31 percent) in the fourth quarter. Wise App analyzed the results of last week's sample survey of 23,000 Android smartphone users in the past 11 weeks, however, the estimated number of users who made transactions, quotations, and message boards in virtual currencies such as Bitcone was only 110,000.Kang Min-ji, a reporter at the Korea Virtual Monetary Exchange, said Monday that the government will discuss closing the virtual currency exchange and then negotiating for the next round of talks on how to deal with it, adding, "" We have agreed on the issue fully. The photo shows the price of a virtual currency, such as Bitcone and E-Dorium, posted on a virtual currency exchange in Jung-gu, Seoul.

"When I see SF movies with artificial intelligence such as Matrix, I-Robot, Terminator, I was born, I would often paint a gloomy future. It's a story set in a world in which the stronger body, the more intelligent, is rebelling, or is already dominating. Now, artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving, as this story is about to become reality. The world witnessed artificial intelligence winning over professional engineers in baduk, which was considered unique to humans for nearly 4,000 years in 2016 and 2017. The robot, Atlas Shrugged, developed by Boston Dynamics, was about 10 years earlier than the University of Oxford's Center for Human Future of Technology predicted artificial intelligence would beat humans at baduk.It's not just intelligence. Recently, Boston Dynamics, a company that develops walking robots, unveiled robots that not only walk and run, but also jump and walk over stepping stones or turn somersaults. The leg muscles look perfect because they don't hurt as much as humans, and they don't even get tired when powered.There is no perfect artificial intelligence in every way! American mathematicians John von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam have characterized this point by predicting that as artificial intelligence develops, it is time to change human life forever. What's unusual is that artificial intelligence appears more than humans, and people don't understand the idea of artificial intelligence.After Neumann, many scientists, philosophers, and futurologists had made a lot of assumptions about what was unusual. American philosopher and mathematician William Demszky said that, no matter how long it takes, artificial intelligence will never be the same as human intelligence, and future scholar Ray Kurzweil would have to appear in humans in 2029.Does it really matter if you have artificial intelligence, including mathematics, that beats people in every way? For an singularity to come, an artificial intelligence has to surpass a human in all areas, not just baduk, but art, music, and mathematics. It's not impossible to do that if you look at the artificial intelligence of composition or drawing these days.So what about math? Although artificial intelligence is much faster in calculating, can the proof be better than the mathematician? According to a mathematician who worked about 80 years ago, artificial intelligence is not likely to beat human beings, at least in mathematics. A perfect artificial intelligence obstacle, mathematics, can you ever find a word or sentence that can accurately express the ideas sometimes that come to your mind? Since our ideas are much more and more complex than we can express in language, no matter how systematic the letters and rules are, we can't express them perfectly.Math, Dong-A, January Issue The computer program is created by "" coding "" in computer languages with complex characters and rules. Similarly, before artificial intelligence can think like a human, it first has to translate what people think into language with rules and formats. If this language is not perfect, why not make artificial intelligence perfect?Mathematicians such as Bertrand Russell and David Hilbert in the early 20th Century tried to make mathematics into languages with similar tastes and grammar, such as Korean and English. Let's change the mathematical proposition, "" If you add two words of training, you can make it your own, "" to the symbol you promised beforehand, and make rules for arranging symbols.With these systematic symbols, you don't have to get confused because of unnecessary expressions. Several people don't have to express the same proposition differently, as some people say, ' It's beautiful ' or others say, ' I'm amazed. ' And when you're teaching mathematics to artificial intelligence, it's hard to make sense to say anything about it, so you just type in these symbols, and you type in the rules that sort of sequence the symbols.Hilbert thought that if he had a symbol on the proposition that turned out to be true and made good rules, the mathematician would be able to demonstrate the process by proving out new proposals. Symbols and rules are incomplete!If you add 1 to 1, you change the mathematical symbol to read 1+1'2, and it looks like you're doing as Hilbert thinks. Did Hilbert really think right?In 1931, Kurt Goedell, an Austrian mathematician, announced the fact that Hilbert was shocked. And when Hilbert thought that if he created some symbols and rules and phrases that could only be written in mathematics, it wouldn't necessarily be clear whether the proposition was true or not.According to Godel, although he may try to prove math problems with symbols, these symbols and rules may not help him find out whether they are correct or wrong. It's as if I wanted to paint a picture with colored pencils, but I would never paint with colored pencils! ' Godel's proof of shocking mathematicians, logic, and philosophers is called Imperfection theorem. The imperfection magnitude theorem implies that systems that have symbols and rules like language, as well as math, are not perfect.What should I do if I can't draw the picture I want with my own color pencil? If you do or don't, you'll try to draw using other tools. But artificial intelligence has only the symbols and rules that are entered, so you can't use anything but colored pencils. If you keep asking me to draw pictures, I'm sure I'll get the error.Mathematical logic scientists think Godel's theorem on imperfection shows that artificial intelligence is limited. As long as you teach artificial intelligence through language of symbols and rules, it's not accessible. Even more, it would be hard for artificial intelligence to imitate them if they were hard to express with symbols like human emotion.Kurt Goedel, who's only in his 20s proven "" Imperfectness theorem, "" needs mathematical proof better than mathematicians to out-of-human artificial intelligence. Now that Godel has already revealed that artificial intelligence can not prove this proposition, we will not be able to catch up 100 percent with people. Whereas we're thinking about how else to prove it, right? >> In the January issue of Math Dong-A, you can learn more about [Kim Woo-hyeon, journalist of Non-Display Korea], and the minimum wage increase in payment was caused by the difficult situation of a mid - to long-term wage hike. The Ministry of Employment and Labor announced yesterday that it would revise the Labor Standards Law to disclose the list of employers who violate the minimum wage and to include them in the list of those subject to credit sanctions. The aim is to strengthen the effectiveness of the system so that employers can observe minimum wage, the ministry explained. In the current National Assembly, the labor standards law revision proposed by MDP Rep. Han Jung-ae is pending at the Environmental Labor Relations Commission. The revision states that if the guilty verdict is found to be less than the minimum wage within three years before the base date, the list is released, and that the credit sanctions are also imposed if the guilty is confirmed twice or more within three years. Small and medium businesses have raised strong complaints about the government's plan to revise the Labor Standards Act. The government is even releasing the names of violators while it is difficult to hire workers because of the steep rise in minimum wage this year, a self-employed business owner sighed. An official at the Korea Employers Federation said, "" I don't see how we can disclose a lot of violators could get away with having a much lower wage rate of less than 10 percent. Mid-and-shore businessmen are trying to live up to the minimum wage hikes burden, but the government seems to be heading for heavier psychological burdens on employers, he added. The Ministry of Employment and Labor announced that it will disclose a list of 198 business overdue business owners and impose credit restrictions and restrictions on 326 business owners. The average amount of debt that the owners of the companies whose names are disclosed is 91.22 million won (94,120 U.S. dollars). Among them, 41 companies had to pay more than 100 million won in arrears. By industry, manufacturing businesses (78 people), construction businesses (39), Incheon and Seoul Metropolitan Government (77 people) were included in the list. By company size, 5 to 29 (109 people) and less than 5 (70 people) were ranked. When disclosing the list, the names, addresses, business names, and land of business establishments, as well as the amount of payment, were posted to the government official gazette, the ministry of employment and local labor offices over the next three years. Information will also be linked to the Worknet, Albamon, and public and private employment portals, limiting recruitment activities. Those subject to credit sanctions will be provided with personal information, such as their name, name, address, business registration number, and corporate registration number, and then receive a credit limit for seven years. The disclosure system of the list of failed businesses was adopted in August 2012 to prevent the delayed payment of wages by enhancing sanctions against businesses with large or chronic debts. The ministry is guilty of two or more convictions within three years, and employers who delay more than 30 million won are guilty of disclosure of the list within three years, and credit rating agencies are subject to 20 million won or more in arrears. bumsoo@yna.co.kr"

Fears have been raised that the request to close the school could reduce the number of students in Seoul, resulting in the closure of schools. Some say that as English lessons after the first or second grade are banned starting this year, the private elementary schools will be hit first before public elementary schools.2018.1.9 / News 1 < Author of News 1 Korea, No Trustee and Redistribution > All Teachers at Eunhye Elementary School, who is discussing closing down, were asked to fire. If this continues, it is unlikely that the school year will be able to operate properly from the beginning. According to the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education and the Presidential Emergency Management Committee on Appreciations and Elementary School of Education, the institute sent out notices of layoffs to all 13 teachers last week, excluding principals. The dismissal date is the end of February, the day when the students were forced to leave their jobs. The principal is a contract whose recruitment ends automatically unless a new contract is renewed, so it was not included in the notice of dismissal. Since the teachers at private schools belong to the school, the education office can not interfere. Multiple Seoul education office officials said they are constantly in talks with their debt service officials to normalize academic operations but can not, in addition, speak of recruiting teachers at private schools. The dismissal of the school from the school means the education office is helpless. Without teachers, it is likely that normal school education will be difficult to operate from the beginning of the school year. Parents say they will use all means to prevent the illegal closing of schools, including measures to manage the academic affairs law. We will discuss all possible measures with parents, including taking legal action, during a meeting this afternoon, said Kwak Byung-seok, chairman of the Presidential Emergency Response Committee. Meanwhile, the school is pushing for the closing of its schools despite the persuasion from the education office and parents. The government has filed for the closure of the Western District Office of Education since late last month, and requested that teachers continue the recruitment process and approve the law as soon as possible. In the event that private schools close down, the education authorities could hire teachers who were dismissed from public elementary schools nearby. If you're leaving the military in July of this year, that is, after October of 2016, you're going to see a decline in numbers, one after another.

As the won`s strength continued, the increase was explained by the spreading sentiment to buy the dollar when it was relatively cheap. According to the Bank of Korea's report yesterday on the trend of the foreign currency deposit between residents during December 2017, the amount of foreign currency deposit at foreign exchange banks rose to $ 83 billion, a record $ 2.82 billion. The figure rose to $ 242.2 billion from $ 589.10 billion a year ago. The resident foreign exchange deposit is the foreign currency deposit that the Korean residents, foreigners who have lived in the country for more than six months, and foreign companies that have made inroads into the country.Double-dollar deposits rose $ 2.59 billion to $ 87.89 billion from the previous month. The reason is that the demand to sell the dollar when it is wrapped up in the dollar, influenced by the decline in the won-dollar exchange rate (strengthening won against the dollar), has increased. Businesses had put their export and mouth payment in deposit or delayed the sale, while individuals increased their investment. Corporate dollar deposits rose $ 2.89 billion from the previous month to $ 57.6 billion, while individual deposits rose $ 560 million to $ 13.1 billion. The yen-based deposit also rose $ 220 million to $ 5.59 billion from the previous month due to increased corporate deposits in funds to repay borrowings.

The committee will discuss how to deal with the delegates who can not notify or announce their intention to resign. Some analyze that this is also a move to reduce the number of people who will attend the group to fill the quorum. In response, the main opposition camp decided to ask the NEC to interpret the Uri Party`s rights to block the revision of the rules, saying it does not conform with party laws.

Annual sales of Lotto recorded the highest sales record last year, rising steadily after recovering to 3 trillion won in 2014. The picture shows a famous lottery room in Jongno-gu, Seoul on July 10. On August 10, 2008, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance's lottery committee released a report titled, ' Recognising recognition of the lottery for men and women in the past year ' (Among them, 57.9 % of the previous year) found that the previous year was up by year. The ministry estimated that 24 million people bought the lottery ticket in consideration of the total adult population of 42 million. On average household income, more than 4 million won was highest at 59.5 percent, followed by 3 million to 39.9 million won (23.0 percent) and 2 to 2.29 million won (11.7 percent). Among male workers, 61.8 percent (male) answered more than female employees (male), followed by white collar workers (clerical, 33.7 percent), blue collar (industrial employees, 22.6 percent), and self-employed households (female businessmen). By age group, people in their 40s ranked the highest with 23.3 percent and those in their 20s ranked the lowest with 14.1 percent. Lotto buyers thought that the optimal amount of money to win the first prize was 2.21 billion won, no different from the average amount of winning prize (1.89 billion won). It is estimated that 56.5 percent of Lotto buyers live more than once a month. The largest single purchase was worth less than 5,000 won (54.6 percent), and less than 10,000 won (92.9 percent) was made up of the total. The lottery is good for you, ' a survey showed, however, that it rose 3.4 percent year-on-year to 74.5 percent. It is the highest rate since the first survey was conducted in 2008, up 20. 3p from the previous decade. The positive assessment was made mostly by respondents who answered ' lottery revenue supports the underprivileged ' (45.2 %) and by ' hope and expectation ' (34.5 %) they enjoyed it. 25.5 percent of the respondents gave the lottery a negative assessment. The reasons for the negative reviews were ' encouraging gambling ' (27.5 %), ' it is a get-rich-quick gamble ' (12.8 %) and ' addictive ' (11.0 %). The lottery was recognized by the lottery as the top prize holder, 30.4 percent, followed by the top prize winner (12.2 percent), and the top winner (5.6 percent). Gambling, which ranked seventh in last year's survey (3.3 percent), was ranked 11th (2.3 percent).

"A funny idea gift from one of my siblings has become a pleasant gift that my parents will never forget.British media Daily Mirror recently told an interesting story about Maria (22) and Matt Warner (20), brothers and sisters in Camebridge, eastern England.The gift that first came to Facebook to talk about was a photo of the past and present of their siblings. Last year, the brothers and sisters, who wanted to give gifts to their parents celebrating the 30th anniversary of their marriage, took the current photo of their brother and sister, which was taken long ago.Maria, my sister, said, "" I was thinking about a gift to celebrate my parents ' wedding, and I thought of a similar photo I saw on the Internet in the past, "" and she said, "" It cost me little money, but my parents were delighted to receive a photo album. ""In reality, photos of siblings released to the public now and in the past are very humorous. The cute little brother and sister disappeared, but perhaps the parents had no more adorable pictures. Maria said, "" We were thrilled to see you as a child, "" and she said, "" but we were thrilled to see you as our little boy and gave you a smile. "" Although the government is determined to close the exchange after consultations and consultations between related ministries, it is widely believed that the momentum for the project has been lost if public sentiment is strongly opposed after Justice Minister Park Sang-ki's remarks.Instead, the government is determined to push for the real-name policy for virtual currency transactions without interruption. The bank plans to allow the use of bank accounts in virtual money-related transactions that have been confirmed by real name. Rather than banning virtual currency transactions altogether, it is apparently turning to securing transparency in transactions and preventing illegal acts such as money laundering and tax evasion. It intends to focus its policy capabilities on preventing illegal and speculative virtual currency transactions.Experts say the government's direction of regulations will likely be to come up with measures to levy heavier taxes on virtual currencies. The effect is that imposing taxes on speculative demand can be restrained, and that stricter monitoring transactions in the course of securing tax information can block illegal transactions.The closing of the exchange is a draft notice by Justice Minister Park Sang-kee on Tuesday morning by Jeong Ki-jun, head of the Economic Coordination Office of the Office of the Ministry of Justice, at Seoul's Seoulcheong District Office. ▽ Photo = Yonhap News Agency (. nyuseu jeongbu . ssda ipjjang neun) highlighted again that the Ministry's proposal to close the virtual currency exchange on virtual currency was not confirmed. Chung Ki-jun, head of the economic coordination department at the Cabinet Office, said in a briefing yesterday, We will consult fully with the local government on how to close the exchange market, one of the measures proposed by the Justice Minister, as part of our special measures to curb speculation.Justice Minister Park Sang-kee and Financial Services Commission Chairman Choi Jong-koo said on July 11 that the proposal to close the exchange was agreed upon by government agencies, but they reversed it in just four days. A senior government official responded, It was only by the point of view that the closing of the virtual currency exchange could be discussed as part of a special measure led by the Office for Government Policy Coordination, ' Minister Park Sang-gi said.If speculative trading in virtual currencies reaches an uncontrollable level, the closing of the Korea Exchange is one of the options to consider, but the government's view is that it can not be decided easily considering cases of other countries.An industry source said, If China banned trading on the exchange but Hong Kong allowed the actual detour by allowing trading on the exchange, we would have been prohibited by the exchange, and Japan has promoted a total ban on trading on the exchange.The statement released by Jeong Ki-jun as the actual fact of the conversion from the "" virtual currency investment responsibility "" policy captures the view of the government that changed from the past. The government said money is not legal tender, and no one is to ensure the value and speculative demand, prices according to the change in domestic and international regulatory environment, in accordance with it.A great loss to dramatically byeondonghae can even, beans, virtual money on one's head is a series of activities, including mining, investment and trade that we need to judge carefully.I need to remind everyone, said.Virtual currency quotation, such as Bitcone, Earlough, posted on a virtual currency exchange in Jung-gu, Seoul. ▽ Photo = The part that stresses the responsibility of Yonhap news is the expression that did not come out of the previous regulatory discussion that focused on banning the transaction itself, such as shutting down the exchange. Another government official commented on the effectiveness of the transaction, saying, "" There is a realistic limit that shutting down the virtual currency exchange was not able to completely block an individual transaction. ""Another noticeable change was the government's emphasis on the industrial aspects of block-chain technologies. The government said it is stern on the excessive speculation in virtual currencies and its wrongdoings but will support and nurture R&D investment in block chains, a basic technology. Financial Services Commission Chairman Choi Jong-koo, who has been criticizing virtual currency transactions, also concluded that the government is trying to regulate block chain technology and speculative transactions, not virtual currencies themselves.Some also reflected the view of the Strategy and Finance Ministry, which had expressed the emphasis on the industrial value of block chains, saying, We can not ban the transactions of virtual currencies unconditionally based on the growth of innovation.It should be noted that the ministry will continue to push ahead with the real-name policy for virtual currency transactions without a hitch. The real-name policy for virtual currency use is at the core of regulations announced by the Office for Government Policy Coordination under the measures of 1228, but it is also an independent regulatory easement presented by the Block Chain Association, which was established with the main virtual currency exchange at its heart. However, following the closing remarks made by Justice Minister Park Sang-kee, banks including Shinhan Bank, which wanted to introduce a real-name verification system for virtual currency transaction accounts, seemed to back down or stop it.The government's comments are said to have reduced uncertainty regarding the introduction of a real-name accounting system for virtual currency transactions. If bank accounts are allowed to be used for transactions with real names certified, a basis could be formed for the transfer of virtual currency transactions into the drawing board, such as voice-over-the-call transactions.Experts say the government's discussions on regulations will focus on what they call the "" virtual monetary taxation scheme. "" Most government ministries agree that taxes should be imposed on incomes from virtual currency investment, but the taxation measures have not been fully discussed due to the lack of clarity regarding virtual currency. A government official said, "" If the government had pushed for a total ban on transactions, such as the closing of the exchange, it would have been difficult to form a proper assessment on virtual currency, "" adding, "" the taxation on the exchange was postponed to a substantial level. ""However, there is expected to be considerable difficulty in discussing specific tax measures. Until now, the financial authorities had opposed the idea of imposing taxes on profits from transactions, so the discussion was not made. Financial authorities are strongly opposed to the idea of seeing virtual money as a financial commodity. The financial authorities ' plan to combine virtual currency into a similar business reflects the perception of defining virtual currency as a general product rather than a financial commodity. On the other hand, the plan to impose VAT, such as game money, was hampered by opposition from the Korea Exchange.The government is reportedly taking a closer look at the case of Japan, which defines the gains from virtual currencies as income subject to comprehensive taxation. Japan is imposing income taxes on virtual money-related investment gains that exceed 200,000 yen on the economy."" Like property taxes, the measures to tax relevant incomes and assets seemed logically most clear, but it was questionable whether they would have any influence on tax sources through self-reporting or not, "" a government official said.[Sejong = Chung Won-seok, journalist at lllp@chosunbiz.com]chosunbiz.com"
