When measuring the gap between cars on either side of the illegally parked road with a tape, it was around 2 meters 85 centimeters. A mid-sized car was barely enough to pass. Among them, I pushed five cars with both hands. The brake was fastened and did not budge.Twenty-nine people were killed in the Jecheon fire. The damages were increased because basic safety rules, such as illegal parking and concealed emergency exits, were not followed. On the day of the accident, fire trucks had difficulty accessing and rescuing fires because of illegal parking. But four days after the disaster, the same thing is happening in the same place. Even though you can see the terrible scene in front of you ... - Cars parked illegally on both sides of a two-lane road near the sports center in Haso-dong, Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province yesterday. One of the reasons that the sacrifice has been great is that the illegal parking has delayed the entry of fire trucks. At that time, fire trucks tried to access the scene by following the road from the left to right of the picture, but failed to do so because of illegal parking. The road in the picture could be diverted, but it also had to go out to the main road for illegal parking and return to 500 meters. The fire department arrived on the scene at 4:00 p.m. on July 21, seven minutes after the first report. However, fire trucks were not immediately put into rescue operations. Traffic illegally loaded the road around the accident building made access to the fire difficult.Firefighters were able to make a detour nearby, but it was also difficult because of illegal parking. Eventually, he went out to the main road, took a turn 500 meters and came in the opposite direction. In addition, vehicles with illegal parking lots had to be cleaned for about 30 minutes to secure enough space for rescue operations.The only place without illegal parking on July 25 was the road in front of a building with a polis line. Police and fire department officials gathered there to investigate the cause of the fire and to handle the accident. Since then, illegal parking has been left unattended on the side streets. The streets near the fire at the Jecheon Sports Center on July 25 were still packed with illegally parked vehicles. The illegal parking spaces of only 2.85 meters are allowed on either side of the 6.6-meter road. This is what you can see in the north (photo on left) and east (photo on right) of the fire scene. / Two lanes of traffic are about 6 meters wide in front of the main gate of the sports center building where the accident took place. The deflection ladder truck at the site was 2.5 m wide, and requires at least 5.5 m of space to install an out-trigger (support) to support the ladder. However, at the time of the accident, more than 10 cars were illegally parked in front of the building on either side of the road. In reality, the road width of the vehicle was only over 2m, and it was impossible to get onto the road with a bent ladder. Seven of the vehicles were called in to remove all illegally parked vehicles, the fire department said. Then I could deploy the ladder in front of the building and the ladder in the back, said Kang.If the same building were to be on fire, would the fire engine get in? There were 10 illegally parked cars on each side of the road in front of the building on July 25. Among them was a media car. Kim Gil-jun (52), a nearby resident, said, "" The sports center opened again last October after the remodeling, and had to pack a lot of customers, "" adding, "" It was hard for the gym and the bath house to accommodate all the passengers. Police ordered vehicles with illegal parking in front of the accident building to be moved to a different location, and blocked the entry of the car by running a polis line at either end of the road. However, there were still a lot of illegal parking lots except for the road in front of the main gate. Because of the limited space available for the vehicles to travel, it was easy to see cars stopping and toggling on the road. When vehicles came from the opposite direction, it was often necessary to back the car to the entrance to avoid traffic. Local residents, Kim Yoon-sang (54), said, "" The area is usually packed with cars on both sides, so the road is paralyzed even when a truck passes. ""The first floor of the accident building, built with a pilotis (a structure that supports the building with a naked post), has a total of 21 parking spaces. At the same time, many sports centers were short of parking, whereas dozens to even 100 people used them. There are only about 20 parking spaces in S-Mart facing the building. Although many residential and commercial buildings were concentrated around the building, few places had separate parking lots. There were only five parking spaces available in the nearby 5-story commercial building. A restaurant owner who runs a nearby accident building said, "" Customers who use a sports center do not have parking lots of cars, so they do not have any parking spaces for children who come to our store. "" The owner of a nearby cafe also said, Some people take it for granted that we should stop illegally in front of the store. If we lack parking, we should not bring our cars. '' Another resident said, "" There are cases where parking is inadequate and you have to park illegally. "" `` The idea of having one of my cars ... '' said Professor of Fire Prevention at Kyungil University in Seoul, "" If you can't change this consciousness, the accident will never happen again.

Indonesian authorities have caught 111 cases of pangolin poaching and smuggling from 2010 to 2015 and arrested 127 people, according to TRAFFIC, a wildlife trade monitoring group, on Tuesday. Authorities seized as many as 35,000 and 632 pangolin corpses and scales from the animals. Among them, 10,491 were being shipped to China and 852 to Vietnam. However, considering the fact that the annual crackdown is fluctuating down to at least 2,460 to 10,857, it is estimated that the number of pangolins dug up in Indonesia and shipped abroad will exceed 10,000. Traffic explained, "" Indonesian pangolins were only used to obtain leather until the 1990s, but poaching increased as the demand for scale, meat and entrails of pangolins, used as herbal medicines grew. ""Containers full of scale pangolin detected in Chinese propaganda on November 29, 2017. [Reuters = combined news footage shows that there is a possibility of a rapid decline in the Indonesian origin of pangolin (the average 7) Ralita Gomez, Director of the Southeast Asian Program for Traffic, said, "" Malay pangolins are creatures at great risk of extinction, so they can not withstand this level of persecution. "" "" At this rate, their population is already at the bottom of China. "" In fact, on Kalimantan Island, where Indonesia and Malaysia divide, pangolins were common until only 10 years ago, but they are now known to be rare in remote areas. The scales and meat of pangolins are used as medicinal herbs and as a premium ingredient in China and Vietnam. However, experts have criticized the effectiveness of pangolin's meat, saying that it is only a superstition, and that the scales used in herbal medicine are not special effects because they are made of the same ingredients as human fingernails. In 2014, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said the wild population of pangolins plummeted to less than 20 percent of its original population in 21 years, designating all eight pangolins as ' threatened species ', ' endangered species ' and ' seriously.

"CBS Kim Hyun-jung News Show - voting from tomorrow, announcing the results on the 31st - to ask the other party member to be persuasive … - external expansion is necessary if you want to survive - blood type three parties? Impeachment 朴 and will increase public opinion polls - the party? - negative consolidated with everything to save on. ■ <Kim Hyun-jung from the news show> radio broadcast : cbs fm 98.1 (09:00 to Make) ■ on.Ahn Cheol-soo : ■ : Kim Hyeon-jung anchor a (national leader by right.) her first order today met Ahn Cheol-soo's ruling people. The reason why I have Ahn today is because the fate of the people's party is decided this week. Starting tomorrow, the vote for and against all party members is to start putting together the right party. Yesterday, 20 lawmakers opposed to the merger placed an injunction against it. It's quite a vehement opposition. Why do you think unity is essential despite such fierce opposition? Meanwhile, proxy personalities appeared on our news show. Many people have asked me to listen to Chairman Ahn's opinion. Let's meet in person today. Connecting Ahn Cheol-soo's ruling people. Hello, Mr. Ahn. Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > How do you do? ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > for four days from tomorrow vote, I'm doing? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > Yes, it is. 27 (male) to 28 (male) online voting ; and 29 (gold) to 30 (Saturday) telephone voting ; and then, on the last day 31. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > 31, the last day of the year. If there is a lot of support, are you going to declare unity on the last day of this year? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > and believe now is integration of former party members and pushed since January. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > You start to work on January 1 and declare on January 31. Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo with the national convention will follow the wishes of party members rather than announcing > it's the decision. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > There is a national convention, but when it comes to the opinion of party members, the committee announced on July 31 and started its plan from July 1. Actually, we only have five days left, this year. However, is it okay to read ` strong will for unification ` that we should declare any former party member's will within this year? Ahn Cheol-soo's (a reporter Photo : Hwang Jin Hwan) ruling people, Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > I'm past two months within the party and hear the word many people, including members of Yes, I also again. Of opinion among the pros and cons has not narrowed down. So, if there is a limit to persuasion, then ask the opinion of the party leader, former party member of the party, and everybody will accept. That's how I started. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Completion time for consolidation to be meaningful. When do you think this is over? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > I'm not sure. It is expected to generally take a little over a month if it starts in January of next year. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > A little over a month. So you're thinking about February or so. Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > convention is probably all have. It's going to take that much time because we have to go through a lot of different processes. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : The most important question, the most basic question. Why now, at this point, should the people's party and the right parties integrate? Why? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > third-party external combustion is essential in order to survive. If you look at the history of political parties in Korea over the past few decades, it is simply an absurd story of the three parties. The three parties are short for one year and long for 10 years. And then they disappeared without exception. But when I looked at it, I looked at it, and I looked at it, and I couldn't scale it out. So I really want to survive before the local elections next year. I insist on doing this in the belief that we can keep multI-party systems that can contribute to the development of our nation's politics. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : Do you think it will be difficult for the people to avoid it when they have a local election? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > No. It is not the name of the problem but the three parties are very difficult to survive, and in this situation, the three districts are divided into two. So, I believe that at least three districts need to work together to have elections in order to fight the two largest parties. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > can not vote in local elections? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > Yes, it's hard. Some people say so. Thirty-nine of us are now talking about, "" Can we hold the election together? "" It is very difficult for 39 people to unite and vote. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Why? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > the fleshy part of the integrated free Korea to go to more than half of the right political party members if you don't have free will Korea be the party. Then I can't stay. The Democratic Party is eventually pulling out the only opposition - members of the People's Party. And then we're going to lose the opportunity to expand out, and we're going to have about 30 Members. And the truth is it's going to die more quickly. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > That's how you see it. Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > And trying to shut it down. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Now is the time, or it is hard to miss this timing. So, I can not help but express my impatience when I hear why you are in such a hurry last week. Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > it is. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > But if you summarize the reasons for the consolidation you have described, there are a few things that are typical of you. First, no matter how important it is to be extensible or externally-extended, how do you integrate and justify a table? Knowing where the right party is originated. Park, a former representative of the Uri Party, once used a phrase like ` blood type differs `, however, how can a blood type become one with another? What do you think? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > between blood type like not getting married? ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > (Laughing) The blood type should not be the same, should it? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > and impeachment right equal to other political parties last year when think about it. The National Party started the impeachment first. And the right party did the final finish. And in fact, in the process, the Democrats were just watching, and then they jumped in. So I believe that the meaning of this unification is to unite the parties that have already concluded the impeachment. I see it that way. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > If so, is the impeachment factor becoming the blind date agent that mediated between the two parties to get married?Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > I'm a very important. If you're a political party that has continued to raise the banner of the anti-Semitic Freedom Party after two defections, it's very natural to join forces with the people. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung >, but the story, so I'll give it a straight question on the market, Ahn Cheol-soo. Is this representative Ahn Cheol-soo's personal dream, seeking to become president.Do you not to proceed in this way because of a greed. What kind of moderate conservative move would it make? You know this question? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > it is rather silly argument. Because if we fail to conduct the local elections next year, the party will disappear and I have no future. I'm all going to the local elections next year. In this situation, I don't think it would be possible to win or not, but I would be foolish to think someone who is so confused with me until the presidential election five years later. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : Are you not in the mood to look forward to five years from now? You're saying it's too much to keep the sugar alive? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > it is. And that's really the objective and strict reality right now. If you turn the word back, you should let the party live now, so that you can think of it five years later. Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > And we don't. And this word here, of conservatism there now? But I don't know what I'm afraid of. That means when you combine 40 of us and 10 others from the right party, we have the same identity as the right party. I don't think so. Rather the direction that our party has originally pursued, namely, reflective progress and innovative conservatism. Let's all go together. That is the spirit of the founding of our party, and it is only when it is combined that it becomes a Yangnal. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > But now 40 lawmakers are united and agree to join forces, but 20 have signed an injunction against voting. And even if it is decided, the lawmakers could opt out. Then only 19 people will go to unity. There are 11 political parties that are right. She says about two out of the 11 members are likely to defect. So even though 11 people are coming, 30 are now less than the citizens ' council members, even though they have to integrate. If we unify but there are fewer lawmakers, does this benefit from consolidation? It's getting smaller. What do you think? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > to take part in the legal move really those who object, and among the 20 minutes. Some people have even participated in that kind of feeling, ' I have to delay the voting of a former member of the party one day to really stop the party from separating further. '◇ Some of you did not participate in the argument against the unification of Kim Hyeon-jung, but rather in the idea of preventing the conflict. How many of you have considered yourself involved? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > in quite a few specific numbers, I know some people, but I as much as possible and it is not appropriate to mention them personally looking forward to meeting you, too.I'll convince. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > As it is now mentioned, about three lawmakers who were in the middle of the term are mentioned. You think at least three of them are convincing? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo. trying to persuade more people to see you and > ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > More? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo that you mean the next time > uiwonsu is negative integration also say this to less. Actually, I have 5 %, 5 % support for each party. But what we're going to do now is we're going to meet at five percent, and that's really the most important thing about the people's support rate. The most important thing in a political party is the popularity rating, which is expected to range from five to five to 15 to 20."
"Could, so this is not a negative consolidation, this is a positive consolidation, I say. (Photo : Data photo) ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > "" The number of lawmakers is not the problem. "" Of course, the other side of the poll asked, "" How reliable is it that you have to answer that question? "" And the other side of the question is, of the question. Rep. Ahn Cheol-soo think, clearly approval ratings will go up. However, I don't think it's fair to say that Ahn, although half the party's lawmakers are against it, they are pushing it too far. Chung Dong-young appeared here last Friday and even used the expression ' It looks like you're seeing a vote for or against the Park Chung-hee style revisionist, an alley dictatorship. ' What do you think? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > I was constantly in search of opinion and attempts to convince them there are points but never will be narrowed down. So I ask the party members, they are the owners. And let's face it. If there are more of those who are opposed to unity, I will resign as head of the House. And I will go to the White Army if united in favor of unification. I said, put everything down and we need to be unified to survive, and I'd give it all up for that. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > ` Put everything down `. You think you've tried your best to convince me? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > that's really enough I don't tell you that all 100 %. I can tell you better try harder, but I don't have much time left. And I proposed this because I felt it would be wise to ask the minds of the party members, the people who were in charge. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > That's how I decided to vote. Then it's really important what happens now, and you've been listening to opinions all over the country since last week. It's a kind of confidence. Do you have any confidence? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo, and other differences in the region and the > is quite a few. Next year's election, Honam is currently being adopted as a quantum structure. But the national elections are held in a four-party structure. So, the calls for a three-way structure are very desperate around the country. However, although the whole country is divided into three parties, Honam is not affected by this structure. And the environmental differences that are so rigid with each other are huge. As incumbent lawmakers said, "" The people of Honam are very opposed, "" I proposed to vote for the party. Of the party members, more than half of the party members are members. It's well over 50 %. So, I decided to suggest that it would be better to reflect the people's opinions of Honam than the general polls. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Don't you have any idea that there will be a lot of support? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > I will humbly accept any results. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Why do I ask this question? With 39 lawmakers now out of the picture and 20 signed the talk-free provisional injunction, it would not be a close vote for unity amid these protests, and in fact, it would make at least 70 percent of the vote overwhelming. Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > I'm not mistakes when it's orders of the members of any results? So, I think all Members of Parliament, including myself, should comply. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > must accept the offer together. But, representative, some of you who are worried about Ahn around you say this. If more votes are opposed after opening doors, it could mean you have to be prepared to do more, not put down. A political storm can be immense because it is a creature. Are you ready to do that? ' How is it? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > I can do anything. I'll have to deal with the bigger ones. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > No, I will ask you a question directly. If there are really many votes against it, it could even lead to a situation where we have to retire from politics. Are you sure you're ready for that? Whose son Ahn Cheol-soo > I'm asking the scheme to. Members will judge what to do when confidence fails. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung, did you put down everything? There are, I guess, all cases in there?

"▽ Agreement on the Field Consistency…Sorry about the disruption of Olympic operations (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) = KT and SK Telecom are in conflict over the communications network at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. The organizing committee for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics started to close the scene, but the two companies ' conflict seems to be brewing. With the Pyeongchang Olympics just a month and a half away, there are concerns that the operation of the communication network may be hampered. KT announced to SK Telecom Monday that it has decided to send proof of contents of the claim that SK Telecom should illegally remove the optical cables from its headquarters in the Olympics. KT also requested SK Telecom apologize and take steps to restore the company's original condition. KT says, "" The Company has obtained a license from the land and appearance owners to establish an inner view, and has accepted the ownership rights. "" So, the owners ' right to use the land is not covered by KT. "" SK Telecom illegally posted the optical cables inside KT without prior consent from KT, and we can not ask for a consultation to use them, "" KT Telecom explained as a result of the huge damages that were done. KT sent its message out one day after the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee announced that the two companies had agreed on the matter. The organizing committee announced yesterday that after an Imwon-level consultation between the Gangwon Development Corporation, KT and SK Telecom on July 18, we have agreed to move SKT's optical cables to other networks. However, the two companies have been at odds over when and what to do with the agreement. KT claims SKT promised to remove the illegally deploying optical cables during the past week, but SK Telecom said it decided to remove the cables by July 29. Last month, KT sued SK Telecom for illegally installing an optical cable inside KT headquarters in Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province. SK Telecom removed the section in front of the International Broadcasting Center (IBC) but installed the rest of the section properly after obtaining approval from the land owner, Gangwon Province Development Corporation. Rather, KT claimed that it illegally occupies the inner coffin held by the Gangwon Development Corporation. An SK Telecom official said, If KT fails to fulfill its original stance on the illegally occupying Gangwon Province Development Authority and is blamed for the negative impact, it is likely that the event will only be passed on to the company, adding, "" If KT is using up such an issue. "" As the two companies are at the helm, the organizing committee is in a quandary. The organizing committee has reportedly sent several requests to the two companies to resolve the dispute over the communication network as soon as possible so as not to cause further issues.KT okko@yna.co.kr will provide news coverage and inquiry ▶ Talking to reporters on a 1:1 chat. Cho (27) who studies for an examination in Mapo-gu, Seoul, the latest trend [Dong-A Ilbo], pays 800,000 won per month for her living. At first glance, it may seem like a few things, but after monthly rent of 500,000 won, only a small amount of money is actually available. She works part-time whenever she has time, but it is not easy to work long hours because she studies for an exam. Even if he passes the exam, Cho will have to pay off 30 million won in student loans. I want to live with my parents and reduce the rent, but it is difficult because my family lives far away, Cho sighed. Those who are younger than 30 years of age often live under such harsh conditions. In the past, people could have a stable life if they had succeeded in getting a job or passed an exam, but the situation is different now. When you think of student loans, such as the one you have to pay off as soon as you get a job after graduating from a residential housing project, it is easy to fall into poverty once and for all. The government has shown low-interest loans through various policy funds, but it can not resolve their situation fundamentally. Though it is difficult to solve the situation right now, some say that quality jobs should be created in the private sector. ○ Housing expense is a burden on household owners under the age of 30. After paying the monthly rent of several hundred thousand won, one can not eat a proper meal, let alone save money. Im (27, female), who lives in a studio apartment in Mapo-gu, Seoul, said, Although he could not afford to pay more than one million won a month for a part time job, he could not afford to pay more than 400,000 won for a home. Their increase in mortgage and credit loans is related to housing costs. Among the financial debts of households under the age of 30, mortgage loans including mortgage loans amounted to 13.84 million won. It is a 23.1 percent increase from the previous year (11,240,000 won). Their mortgage loan rates were mostly to provide housing for 52.9 percent and deposit for pre - and monthly rent of 37.0 percent. Education loans based on entering university are another factor that makes household spending harder for people in their 20s. A businessman in Jongno-gu, Seoul, said, "" In addition to the monthly rent of 450,000 won, I could have paid back 350,000 won each month in student loans. "" If I had to pay 800,000 won per month, I would have paid fixed expenses. In some cases, they return to their "" kangaroo "" lives under the protection of their parents to cut living costs. Lee, 29, who lives with her parents again after finishing two years of independence from work, said, I went back to my parents ' home because it is difficult to reduce the rent and living expenses. It was an unavoidable choice to make savings and others. If parents need to live apart from their parents due to work or school, or if their financial conditions are not favorable, it is difficult to do so.○ The economic growth rate for this year will exceed 3 percent due to the increase in youth employment, but the jobless rate for youths continues to rise. Unemployment among young people stood at 9.4 percent in August of this year, the highest level since August 1999, when the foreign exchange crisis was just following it. In September, the youth unemployment rate edged down slightly from the previous year, but the overall jobless rate rose. Unemployment among young adults stood at 9.2 percent in November, the highest since data was compiled in 1999. The unemployment rate is worse. Unemployment among youths in May and June rose 0.9 to 1.8 percent from the same period last year, exceeding 20 percent. The government is also taking the issue seriously. Moon Jae-in is president of this month. "" in Cheong Wa Dae staff meeting on Tuesday to more than 3 percent growth this year and employment rates and macroeconomic indicators are better and better.The problem is youth employment but still not resolved. "" "" By the middle of January, youth employment to check the situation and measures for youth employment to prepare for the meeting.Please, said. Experts agree that jobs should eventually be created that are stable and secure a certain wage level. If the economic rebound is not so noticeable, companies should be more likely to burden young people with more productive jobs than young people, said Ju Won, economist at Hyundai Economic Research Institute, who said, Both raise wages and burden young people with jobs.Sejong = Choi Hye-ryeong, Choi Hee-Chang, Kang Seong-huI, official reporter, Facebook, Donga-bo, Dongsando, Dongsaek, Dongsaek, Dongsaek, Songhwa, Seung-dong, Seung-dong, Seung-dong, and Dong-dong."
"Early this month, good news came to Hanyang University students. The Seoul Metropolitan Planning Board passed a plan to build a dorm for Hanyang University, which will have two basement levels and seven ground floors by 2022. Dormitory for foreign students who were already licensed in 2002 (the 6th grade of the student government) is also likely to be promoted.It is the first time that Hanyang University has crossed the mountain in more than two years since it planned to build new dormitories. The school said, "" If dormitories are built as planned, they can accommodate more than 1,200 more students, reducing the burden of housing costs on students who are tired of the month-long financial crisis. ""Hanyang University students ' union said it would welcome the new dorm proposal once it is approved. / Although Hanyang University's student union Facebook, it is still unclear whether the dormitories will be built as scheduled. It is because of the fierce opposition movement by studio rental companies near Hanyang University through the "" Anti-Dormitory Building of Dormitory Policy Committee. ""They insist on "" guaranteeing the right to live. "" Hanyang University is close to where most of the older people in their 70s or 80s live, but they earn their living on a monthly basis. An official at a licensed real estate agency in Wangsimni, said elderly people are stomping their feet in fear that dorm rooms would reduce demand.Residents say they will put the brakes on the remaining licenses in the future, such as assessing traffic and environmental impact.Complaints from some studio operators against the building of the dorm by Hanyang University. The Seoul Metropolitan University as well as major university universities have recently raised an in-depth dispute with their neighbors over the building of the dormitory.■ Students, "" Aren't they studio operators egoism? "" College students are the main attractions. The rent for the studio is so heavy.In fact, Hanyang University has a lower than average dorm occupancy rate. According to the results of the university information disclosure analysis conducted in 2017, the average dorm occupancy rate at universities in the Seoul Metropolitan area is 16.1 %.Lee Ji-eun, an intern reporter at major private universities in Seoul, only accepts 12.5 percent of the dormitories. This year, he opened the 5th Living Room for freshmen, but it is still below average. Students at Hanyang University say, We have the right to be allowed to live in residential areas, adding, It is unreasonable for a university student without an official income source to claim a monthly rent of 10 million won and exceed 500,000 won.According to the Hanyang University Students ' Association, the new dorm fee is 180-260,000 won based on double rooms. Compared to the monthly rent of apartments near Hanyang University (500,000 won), it is only half price.To be honest, I don`t want to live in a studio with mold and cockroaches in it, said a 20-year-old student at Hanyang University who has not yet shown signs of making any more money than the dorm rooms.Korea University Students Calls for Floating Dormitory for Korea University Dormitories for Fourth Year. / Hanyang University is not the only university conflict over the creation of Facebook Dormitory. Korea University has been suffering from resident protests for more than four years, leaving the dormitory construction project afloat. Korea University complained about the dorm's acceptance rate of only 103 percent. In 2013, it announced plans to build a new dorm for 1,100 people, but was postponed indefinitely due to protests from residents. Chongshin University has been given permission to build new dormitories, but business has been suspended due to opposition from residents. Dongduk University put its plan to build a dormitory on hold after the conflict.Dormitory is the reason why studio apartments are ruined?If the studio rental operators insist, will the nearby studio be destroyed? In fact, in college cases where dormitories were built at the end of the conflict, the studio was often left unscathed after the building.Ewha Women's University's University's School opened last year, and found 2,244 new dormitories (E) - Dormitory rates at Ewha Womans University rose to 22 percent this year from 11.3 percent last year, making it the top private university in Seoul.Even after the new dormitory was built, the demand for apartments and motels near Ewha Womans University remained high. An official at the office of a Daehyeon-dong C authorized broker said, "" The rental company and nearby businesses were not too concerned about how to make a living when Ewha's dormitories were built. "" However, regulations on student enrollment such as curfew and penalty were high.In fact, the competition rate for entrance into Ewha's dormitories is not high at 1.3 to 1. Students who prefer apartments that offer more free privacy than group life are still looking for apartments.University studio apartments are also popular among novice students and single workers because of their convenient transportation and good infrastructure. This is why many Officetels including Itharisen and Theoon enter the dormitory after the construction.Ko Jong-wan, the head of Korea Asset Management Institute, said, "" The area around Wangsimni, where Hanyang University dormitories are located, is close to the Gwanghwamun business district and the workers ' demand for apartments is continued. ""Comparison of average dorm and studio rental rates for major universities in Seoul.If Lee can not satisfy all of the intern journalists, it is also pointed out that building dormitories for living on socially disadvantaged college students should take precedence over rental companies ` businesses.Seo Seo-hyun, an architecture professor at Hanyang University, said, "" The environment around the school is really bad, and the students even pay rent by working part-time. "" "" No dorm is for the neighborhood straw, so the older generation says that it is for the neighborhood straw.A representative of an authorized brokerage office in Wangsimni, said, Rather than opposing dormitories, studio owners would upgrade their facilities or lower their rent rates to provide the apartments they wanted to live in.[By Lee Ji-eun, Personnel Exchange Team leejin0506@chosun.com][ a reporter an intern, the dot-com shortcut] - copyrights © 5 Kits combine the Chosun Ilbo and chosun com, reserved.The - the "" evidence of additional charges.""

If the number of childcare leave is shorter than one year, the remaining two times can be used for shorter working hours.The Ministry of Employment and Labor yesterday announced its Women's Employment and Welfare measures, which include such measures, along with six related ministries. ◇ Measurement of pregnancy, female workers, the Moon Jae-in is measures, the government's expanded to ten days of paid maternity leave and paternity leave ... spouse employment of women labor policy road map, and the sixth round of the Equal Employment Opportunity.(2018 to 2022) and WorkFamily Reconciliation Plan '. The contents are mainly composed of classes such as preventing career discontinuities of female workers who work in Δ and promoting female workers who have lost their careers in Δ and creating jobs that do not discriminate among women. First of all, "" pregnant female workers "" are allowed to take paternity leave to prevent a female worker from cutting her career short. Therefore, childcare leave during pregnancy can be used for up to 10 months, followed by maternity leave of 90 days and childcare leave after maternity leave. It is aiming to enforce it by revising the law in the first half of next year. A limited number of ' shorter working hours during pregnancy ' (2 hours) claims are extended to the full pre-conception period, which is allowed only before and after 12 or 36 weeks of pregnancy. It is scheduled to revise the research services and laws from next year before enforcing them in 2020. It also actively supports childcare. The "" maternity leave "" of the current five-day limit for males is to be extended gradually to 10 paid days per year until 2022. The incentive for the second child leave, whose parents take sequential leave of absence from work (90 percent), will be raised to 2 million won from the previous 1.5 million won. The government also plans to increase the wage for childcare leave from 40 percent to 50 percent of the usual wage after the first three months, the upper limit from one million won to 1.2 million won, and the lower limit from 500,000 won to 700,000 won.

Currently, there is a choice between paternity leave and working time reduction within a year in total, but the remaining period can be used twice as shorter working hours in the next year. For example, if one takes six months off from work to raise a child, he or she can use the remaining six months of work twice as much as the remaining one year. In addition, it was possible to provide support for childcare leave holders who can afford to return to their employers who hire alternative workers (up to 7.2 million won per year for small businesses and up to 3.6 million won per year for large businesses). Support for maternity and childcare support will also be strengthened for workers who have been in the blind spot. The maternity leave payment (typically 100 % of wage and 1.6 million won above) shall be enforced by workers on maternity leave when the contract period expires during the period of maternity leave (90 days before or after the birth). In addition, childcare leave is now required with the requirement of working for more than one year, but childcare leave will be available even when the term is longer than six months.

"【 New Sis&amp;Park Jin-New Sis-New : A day after the death of a newborn, the intensive care unit of a new baby is temporarily closed at Ewha Womans University Hospital in Seoul. Four children, two babies and two girls, died in succession from 9.30pm on 16 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. in the Inter-interception of Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital. An antibiotic therapy that has passed away in the blood of a newborn baby died at Ewha Womans University Hospital. The disease control center said Monday that the sheets found in the blood of newborns were also found in a lipotrophic injection administered to them by Citrobacter FreundI. Lipid nutrients are shots designed to supply fatty acids and calories to patients who have difficulty eating. Health authorities estimate that the injection was already contaminated as germs were also detected. Accordingly, the route of contamination of lipid nutrition injection is being investigated in collaboration with metropolitan teams of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. However, the ministry said it could not determine the link between neonatal deaths and infection. According to the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention, five out of 16 patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at Ewha Womans University Hospital were injected with central venous tubes (injection of nutrients such as paratracheal veins and jugular vein) As a result, four children died, but the other survived. The cause of death will be a comprehensive look at the results of tests being carried out by the National Institute of Scientific Investigation, the KCDC said. Meanwhile, the health authorities conducted monitoring of 12 new infants who were discharged or transferred from the intensive care unit of a Mok-dong baby at Ewha Womans University, and found no symptoms of infection related to the virus were suspected with the virus. With the exception of the three newborns who were released from the hospital and went home, nine of them are currently hospitalized. According to the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention, nine blood and feces were tested and no bacteria were detected on the sheet. However, it has been confirmed that nine newborns were infected with rotavirus, so they are under the supervision of their physicians and are being quarantined at hospitals. Rotavirus was detected in an incubator and blanket in an intensive care unit of a newborn baby at Ewha Womans University, and eight people were infected with the same gene type of rotavirus virus. For the other one, an analysis is currently underway.The KCDC will constantly monitor the health of newborns through medical institutions and health centers. The Health Ministry and the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention will ask medical institutions nationwide to strengthen infection control in hospitals, such as the neonatal intensive care unit, and prepare safety measures for the neonatal intensive care unit according to the results of a safety check. ijoinon@newsis.com> Doubles Hard to Double in Performance for 10 Years … It has been revealed that Zidinet Korea, a reporter at Samsung Electronics, intentionally lowered the performance of its older iPhone model, and that "" Battery "" is the focus again. The main reason for limiting iPhone performance was the battery's performance limitations.Apple's trick was to solve the problem. But when Apple decides why it uses such tricks, it encounters the problem of "" battery limitations. ""Why has the IT industry been unable to get out of the battery worries for decades? Is the battery not really keeping up with IT device performance?As it was revealed that Apple's battery has impaired the performance of its older iPhone, the performance of the battery is receiving renewed attention. Once you look at the numbers that are exposed, you can check the limits.Michael Sincula of Envia Systems, California's leading battery startup, announced an interesting study, according to Synet. According to the study, battery performance was less than twice what it was between 1995 and 2007. Sinkula revealed that battery performance did not improve by more than 30 % between 2007 and 2015. It also estimated that by 2021, the current battery performance would not even be twice as high as that of today.If you look at the surrounding situation, you may have some doubts about the estimate. These days, laptop PC batteries last about 10 hours. It has improved significantly compared to only about four hours a decade ago.How could this have been possible without an explosive increase in battery performance? Cinet attributes the results to its "" smaller parts "" and "" better power management software. ""As the processor size of computer brain decreased, it was able to reduce the amount of power consumed. Of course, the ability to reduce processor size was due in large part to technological advancement based on Moore's Law.■ New material experiment such as Lithium-Air ... performance may be improved, but focusing on the battery will change the situation. It is not performing as aggressively as other IT technologies. Why?Cinet has analyzed this part of the book very well.A battery is basically a combination of metals and chemicals. When connecting them together, an electric current flows.Chemicals, however, do not necessarily lead to improvements in performance, although they can be scaled down. It is the same as transferring water to a small cup. Even if you reduce the size of the cup, the water is just water.Battery performance has improved so far thanks to the introduction of new materials. In the beginning, the batteries that used nickel, a type of metal, began to have a significant increase in duration when they were turned into lithium.However, the current research is focused on boosting lithium battery performance. That means it is not easy to expect a drastic change, although it may mean a gradual improvement.Researchers at the IBM Almaden plant continue to experiment with the development of advanced batteries. ▽ Photo = Cinet = Innovative batteries that can operate smartphones for a week are not yet included in the industry's research subjects, according to Cinet.Of course, major IT companies are making various attempts to improve battery performance. IBM is the most famous.IBM is working on battery research at Almaden's factory in San Jose. The company launched a project called ' Battery 500 ' in 2009. The goal was then to develop a battery that could drive the car up to 800 kilometers.They focused on developing Lithium-Air Batteries to achieve this goal. Unlike lithium-ion batteries that rely on carbon and other metals, it was an attempt to make electricity by utilizing containers filled with air interacting with lithium.If successful, the battery could be weighed in half.However, IBM's research ran into one limitation. In order to operate the Lithium-Air battery properly, it needed "" pure air. "" But the air we breathe was filled with pollution and water.We needed a purifier to get the air we wanted. Of course, doing so would increase battery size and weight.■ Apple, in its 2009 MacBook Pro ; Battery Revolution & Apples ; The reality is … The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Texas University researchers have also launched projects to overcome battery performance limitations. They are considering using metals such as silicon, sulfur, and sodium.According to Seanett, their research focuses on cars. Even if the technology is successfully developed, it will take some time before it can be applied to consumer electronics such as smartphones.Stanford scientists once announced that they had made batteries with pure lithium. If announced, it could put more energy into it than now. However, it is also expected to take some time to become commercialized.IT technology is developing at a rapid pace. However, the battery area is not meeting expectations yet. Apple, which is under fire for limiting iPhone performance, is also suffering from a lack of freedom from the agony.(Photo : Cinet) Apple boasted in 2009 that it succeeded in the "" battery revolution "" when it launched its new MacBook Pro.Back then, the battery used in the MacBook Pro had a life span of 40 percent longer than a traditional model. Thanks to these programs, the program lasted up to seven hours.But the story since then is as we know it. Still, battery life is not significantly extended at that level.When can humans use IT devices without having to worry about charging them? And when can you free your IT device from the effects of batteries that dramatically degrade its performance?Companies that answer this question calmly are expected to take the lead in the next generation of IT wars.Kim Ik-hyeon, a reporter at (sini@zdnet.co.kr) and subscribe to Jidinet Korea from Naver."

According to Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, the average concentration of PM 2.5 (ultrafine dust with a diameter of 2.5 ㎛ or less) in Beijing decreased by 54 % from the same month last year to 46 U.S.C. It is the lowest level in five years. In particular, the average concentration of PM 2.5 was recorded at 38 ㎍ / / ㎥, less than half of last year's 93 ㎍ ㎥ /, as Beijing officially started to heat it on the 15th day of the month. The number of days of severe smog accident in Beijing decreased from the day of last year to the day of this year. As a result, Beijing residents can enjoy sunny days more often this winter than last year, according to the SCMP. Beijing officials are optimistic that it will sufficiently achieve its original goal of lowering the mean PM 2.5 to not more than 60 ㎍ / ㎥ by the end of this year. To remove the stigma of smog hell, the Chinese government has set a strong environmental plan with the goal of lowering the mean PM 2.5 to not more than 35 ㎍ ㎥ / by 2030. One of the major contaminants in northern China, coal heating, is switching to gas and electric heating. The fines for factories that exceed emission standards are also tightened, and measures for factory closures are taken in the event of serious breaches. However, some point out that the favorable climate conditions in Beijing have also worked to improve the air quality, so people should not be overly optimistic. Majun, head of the Center for Public Environment Studies, said, Although authorities ` efforts have contributed to improving the air quality in Beijing, the fact that strong winds and cold air could have reintroduced this winter. He said, "" The environmental improvement measures for heavy industries, the main source of pollution in the North, are not being done properly, "" adding, "" the need for a strict enforcement of environmental policies according to the rule of law, and the transparency of information networks is very strong.

"Gwang-ho fire caused by the construction of the Metapolis and Goyang General Terminal (Suwon = Yonhap News Agency)Hong Ki-won, a fire fighter (Suwon = Yonhap News Agency), is on fire at an apartment construction site in Yeongtong-gu, Suwon, Gyeonggi Province. The blaze killed 21 people and injured 118 percent in total. As the cause of the fire at the Officetel site of Gwanggyo New Town in Suwon became clear on Christmas Day, the case is expected to be included in the repeated case of careless fire. Police in southern Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, secured statements from two employees who had made a courageous decision on the second floor of the apartment building where the fire started, and stated that the fire started in BultI, a kind of insulated gate. Workers said one was cutting and the other was monitoring the fire with three men, and while working in groups of two, he cut through the beam using an oxymoron cutter and then splattered the beam. The insulation was 1.2 m wide and 2.4 m long, and had 70 to 80 (7 to 8 levels) stacked on one side and caught fire immediately when it caught fire. Workers tried to evolve into two 30-kilogram fire extinguishers on the site, followed by two safety managers, but when they failed to control the blaze, they called 119 and evacuated. Eventually, BultI became a fire and killed one of the workers on the ground floor. According to the National Security Agency's fire information center, the number of fires caused by fireworks was 1,488 in 2014, 103 in 2015, and 1,744 last year.As the Dongtan Metapolis Store fire started again and again, regulations were tightened to prevent the possibility of a repeat of such accidents. Article 241 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (welding in areas where ventilation is not sufficient, etc.) is inadequate for ventilation or ventilation, and is strictly required to comply with the requirements of sparking work inside a flammable building. It is a measure to prevent the spread of sparks, such as fire prevention equipment, anti-spattering covers, and welding fire protection foam. The 9th Commandment of Industrial Field Health Rules, 10, affixed to most construction sites shall be ‘ separation of flammable and explosive materials during welding or curing of metal ’. In addition, the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency should complete a work permit, place a weapon monitor until the flame is finished, and add a bucket containing the recommended anti-sparkle protection and sand to be placed in a bucket (with the recommendation for positioning of the fire). Oxygen cutters, especially those used for more flame-prone drilling than welding, are used in places where there is a risk of explosion or fire due to risks posed by the Ministry of Employment and Labor's rules on industrial safety and health. Similar fires biting their tails originated in the failure to follow these safety regulations. The fires at Metapolis Shopping Center, Goyang General Terminal and Seo-Inchon Logistics Warehouse were also caused by the spark while performing the fireworks, without any action, in areas surrounded by styrofoam, urethane foam and sandwich panels. Kang Seung-gwan, executive director of the Korea Welding Industry Cooperative Federation, said, "" In this case, the incident has not yet been confirmed in detail, but in most cases, the flame processing was secure due to sub-contracting or negligent construction due to lack of construction equipment supply.

"Why are there only 4 colors in a passport? The U.K. government has decided to change the colors of its passports after the Brexit UK withdrawal from the European Union. I decided to return the cover of my passport, which is now red and red. It's been 30 years since I adopted the scarlet passport in 1988. Britain then volunteered to replace the passport color it had been using for nearly 100 years. The color of the passport that the European Union's former European Community (ECC) countries mostly used for their passports was red, and the U.K. decided to make the decision themselves as a part of it. Since the color has changed to strengthen association between communities, it may seem natural to return to the original color as long as you decide to stay away from it. Britain's Passport before the passport was changed in 1988 (left) and the current U.K. Passport. [Wikipedia] Britain's Prime Minister for Independence and sovereignty change. "" (Indeed, Prime Minister Terrisa May 22) The U.K. government will issue the new passport starting in October, 2019. The problem is that there are different opinions within the U.K. about the passport color change : "" a symbol of true independence "" and "" a waste of money. "" As long as it's okay to get in and out of the country, I don't think the color of my passport is really what it is, but I don't think so. Come to think of it, I don't think they use it for any colors or passport covers. I don't remember seeing yellow passports. So there must be a reason why women's rights colors are different. A color coding [Passport cover] is a global financial advisor who issues a regular Passport Index each year under the Passport Index, in red, green, blue and black colors. It's red, green, blue, and black. There are slight variations in brightness and saturation, but they do not go outside the larger frame of 4 colors. In addition, countries in the same geopolitical category might display consistency in the colors of their passports. EU members, for example, use red on the cover of passports. As I said earlier, Britain's replacement of passports in 1988 was to follow the unity of the E.U. But it does not have anything to do with the colour of the passport of the member countries. Croatia, who joined the European Union in 2013, still uses a dark blue passport that's close to black. Passport label for 28 EU member countries. All countries except Croatia (6th from right above) use red markers. Passport of Turkey Introduced in 2010 -- with the exception of Croatia -- that would give May independence and sovereignty over the abolition of the red passport. Turkey's adoption of the red passport in 2010 is interpreted as "" the desire to join the EU. "" Meanwhile, the Caribbean countries all use blue passports. Harriet Qualifications and Conversations in Passport colour Arton Capital says, "" There is a reason to use a particular color. "" The colors that usually represent novelty and hope are blue. They're countries in the New World, like North America and Oceania. Passport of Saudi Arabia-Color colors used to represent the nation's beliefs are also used to cover passports. The green of Saudi Arabia is the case. Saudi has a religious background, with a green flag. Green is called ' colors of Islam. ' Muhammad, the prophet who loved green most, heard the green flag whenever he went into conquest. And for those of you who live in barren deserts, green symbolizes the land of nature and the breath of life. There are also practical reasons why women's rights are limited in color. As it is a worldwide valid identification card, the security function is essential for the passport. We don't use any paper, and we don't have a few companies around the world that produce it. You can meet a variety of challenging conditions and therefore have to limit colors. Distinguished passports, such as moving pictures, have recently begun to apply diversity to the world of passports, and in Finland, we've personalized new passports that were introduced in 2012. Not special on the outside. Finnish passports get special when they open. And on each page, I drew a moose, and when I turned it over the page, it looked like it was running. Temporary Passport of Canada Some countries have used ultraviolet light to draw ' artwork ' from their passports. It's a passport of Canada, the United States, China, etc., and it allows you to see a hidden picture when it's hit by ultraviolet light. There are even passport that uses a different color. Canada's interim passport has a white cover, and the Norwegian passport, which is scheduled to be introduced next year, will show a different color. Herr Norway, the new passport design for 2018 is set to become the most radical when appearing, especially Norway's new passport. Design of a new Norwegian passport that simplifies Norway's natural environment. If you reflect a Norwegian passport on ultraviolet light, you can see a night view. New Passport Design Norway elected in the 2014 Contest. It used a color that was not previously used for the passport. As a design powerhouse, Norway engaged in a new passport design in 2014, which resulted in winning the bid for the Noyer Design Studio in Oslo. I drew a simple picture of Norway's natural environment on the inside of the passport, and when I was exposed to ultraviolet light, I saw a beautiful landscape painting, like a night view. The cover color is also noticeable. Passports with white, blue, and orange labels were used as immigrant, diplomatic, and ordinary, respectively. The turquoise comes in the blue and red category respectively, but it is certainly a cheerful color that differs from the traditional heavy color.

The statute of limitations on the crime is set to expire on February 21 next year, and it has 58 days left on the day of the investigation when the investigation team will be released. The investigation into the special prosecutor is linked to accusations of tax evasion by the company. The abandonment of the special duties is established only when "" the recognition of the guilty party stipulated in the special law and the suspension of the duty "" is made.

"▽ The largest volume of new apartments (PG) [Production Issue] [Lee Tae-ho] [Current construction capacity is larger than the development of the five largest new cities in the Seoul metropolitan area (September 1, 2000). This is the largest annual volume ever recorded of new homes in the Seoul metropolitan area, which began to be built in the 1990s under the construction of the two million-thousand housing units. As the volume of land moved in has increased following the government's regulations on real estate prices, some regions are expected to experience adverse effects such as a shortage of reverse-rents. According to the Real Estate 114 survey on July 26, the total number of apartments to be built in the nation next year will be 439,611, a 14.5 percent increase from this year's 383,821 apartments. This volume is larger than when the Roh Tae-woo administration started constructing the two million homes in 1988 to stabilize housing prices. As the development of five new towns in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, Bundang, Ilsan, and Pyeongchon, commenced in the late 1980s, the volume of new apartments moved greatly increased in the 1990s. The volume of apartments to be built in the nation increased from 249,000 in 1991 to 444,988 in 1992, with the number of apartments to be built in 1994 (414,469 households) and 1995 (419,430 households) However, when the relocation of the first new town was completed in the 2000s, the annual volume of new towns was never exceeded 400,000. The volume of houses in the past two decades was also far below the 400,000 mark. As the volume of new apartments is expected to grow next year, the market is worried about the potential impact on the volume of goods in the market. The largest volume of apartments will be located in Gyeonggi-do, where 161,992 apartments, 25.7 percent more than this year, will be moved. It is also the largest amount of land in the region since 1990. Seoul, the world`s most recently independent residential area, will also have 34,703 households next year, a 28.3 percent increase from this year. There is also a high volume of land to live in. The province, which enjoys the benefit of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, has only 59,509 apartments this year, but a nearly 180 percent rise to 16,542 next year. Jeonbuk will have 13,299 homes, up 129 percent from this year, and North Chungcheong will have 22,762 homes, up 86 percent. ▽ Maximum quantity of apartments to be built in 2018 (Yonhap News Agency) = As the construction site of the Raemian Seochee S (593 households) is scheduled to move in on January 26, the exterior walls will be painted. According to the real estate information firm Real Estate 114, the total number of apartments to be built in January next year is 43,366. It is the largest amount ever to be entered into the country in January. Among 2018, the volume of new apartments was about 440,000 nationwide, larger than the annual volume of apartments in the 1990s when the nation first moved into the country`s five largest new cities. Gyeongnam and Chungnam, which are currently selling more and more units, will have 39,615 more apartments and 24,000 to 36,363 units, each, similar to this year. Busan has 23,193 homes, 16 percent more than this year. Meanwhile, the Daegu Metropolitan Government will reduce the number of residents to 12,743 next year after having exceeded 20,000 for the past year and two years. Next year, the largest volume of new apartments is expected to be built nationwide since the 1990s, imposing a burden on the housing market. Photograph of a real estate agency sign in an apartment complex in Gangnam-gu, Seoul. [Yonhap news agency expects the price stabilization to be continued as the volume of land moved in next year.] Some fear is raised that as the price of rental apartments falls, owners will be unable to take out the rent in reverse. In some unpopular areas in the metropolitan and provincial areas, rentals and rental fees are temporarily out of date, and can therefore be recontroved when a house is put on the auction block. It is also expected to affect the subscription market. The number of unsold apartments nationwide rose 2.36 percent from the previous month to 56,507 as of the end of October, with South Chungcheong Province posting more than 11,399 apartments and 11,577 apartments, respectively, according to the ministry. Sales and advance in these areas have been dropping recently. Nevertheless, private construction companies are preparing to provide more than 410,000 new apartments next year, raising concerns over an increase in unsold apartments. Amid the sharply tightened regulations on lending, the construction industry is set to face the biggest challenge of securing the remaining loans next year. As housing prices have recently increased, many apartment owners have been forced to sell new apartments for investment rather than live. The industry predicts that many people will give up their homes at the time of completion and sell their rights to sell their apartments if they are unable to make a loan or if their home prices become weaker next year. "" As many apartments are moving forward, we don't think they would have been forced to move into a rental house if we ran out of sales, "" said an official of a major construction company. "" In particular, it looks like the price of unsold homes is going to grow as fast as this year due to government regulations, increased occupancy and supply, "" said Ham Young-jin, director of Research Center for Real Estate 114.sms@yna.co.kr The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said on July 26 that bacteria from the lipid nutrients donated by Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital to premature babies were found to have developed into bacteria called citroprundI. Germs, such as antibiotic bacteria from the blood of premature babies. Lipid nutrients are medicines that provide fats and calories to children who have difficulty eating. All the babies were injected with central veins. Five people had the same nutritional supplements, and four of them died. So far, no bacteria have been detected in the complete intravenous feeding (TPN) estimated to be an infectious agent. Gilbon believes nurses at Ewha Womans University Hospital most likely carried germs before injecting the medicine into their children. Lee Hyung-min, chief of the clinic's infection control, said, It could have been contaminated during the process of taking medicine out of a large bottle and distributing it to children. We are placing more emphasis on possible contamination in the preparation process for intensive care units than on the pharmacy department of hospitals. The geotrophics were prescribed on the afternoon of July 15, the day before the children died. Symptoms of breathing difficulty and fever occurred on July 16. The lipid nutrients injected on the day of his death did not produce germs. The lipid nutrients injected on the 13th to 14th were used up and could not be collected. The symptoms usually occur 48 to 72 hours after bacteria enter the body, said Professor of infectious medicine at Gacheon-gil Hospital of Kacheongdae University, saying, Germs grow especially well in fatty medicines. But it is possible that the premature baby died suddenly of blood poisoning because he or she is small. The vaginal folliculus has not yet decided on the cause of death from germ-tainted lipid nutrients. The exact cause of death is not until the National Institute of Scientific Investigation completes its autopsy. Twelve newborns who were hospitalized with dead babies were not particularly ill. The fecal examination, etc. did not produce bacteria from the bacteria on the sheet. The patient is not suspected of being infected. Jeong Jong-hun, reporter sakehoon @ jo ng joongang.co.crew."

Bitcone is currently setting a record at $ 14,21 as of 9.30 a.m. Korean time. The gap with the high scores on July 17 was still around 30 percent. As Bitchin continues to grow unstable, investors are becoming more vigilant. As financial authorities in each country enforce regulations on virtual currencies such as Bit-Coins, many investors are forecast to face increasing pressure to dump their products. Experts say such an adjustment is inevitable, considering that the price of the beet coin has soared in the short term, and forecast that the sale of the coin will not stop. "" Virtual currency prices have gone sky high, "" Marty Greenspan, an Israeli online broker, told Bloomberg, "" Now we need to get back to reality. "" If the price has risen by more than 150 percent within a month, now there will be a double-digit decline, he added.[AP = Yonhap news agency] There is also an expectation that the price of beatcoiner will fall. Former Vitcone Strongist Michael Novogratz, former chief of investment at the fortress, told The Financial Times the previous day that he sold off part of Bitcone, claiming that the price could be as low as $ 8,000. Called the Legend of Hedge Funds, he told CNBC last month that the price of Bitcone would soar to $ 40,000 late next year. As Bitchin continues to ride on the roller coaster ride, other countries ' efforts to control their transactions have become noticeable.[Graphic] Is the Bitcone Bubble over ... Even during the holiday, Israel announced on the same day that it would close its business of Bitcone trading business from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, and followed suit around the world. This is the same vein as the U.S. financial industry regulatory authorities, which warned against businesses that promote high returns with virtual currencies such as Bit-Coin. Reuters also stated, "" The Russian government is considering allowing virtual currency transactions only to expert traders. "" "" Only professional market participants should be allowed to deal virtual currency, "" Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told Russian broadcaster Rossiya 24, "" You shouldn't allow the public to trade virtual currency. "" These regulatory matrices are expected to send out more shocks to the bit`s coins and virtual currency. As China closed its market in September by banning virtual currency disclosure (ICO), the price of Bitcone plunged 300 percent from the beginning of this year. According to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), companies that produce graphics processing equipment (GPU) essential for mining Bitcons are also cautious about investing due to the volatility of the bills. According to reports, mining, where computers can solve complicated math tasks to obtain virtual currency, requires a high-end graphics card. Accordingly, the semi-conducting companies, Envidia, and AMD, have made more than $ 200 million in additional revenue over the past two quarters due to the bit-coining frenzy. However, the newspaper also reported that these companies are careful about the supply, as the price of Bitcone shows extreme volatility and changes in basic technology could affect the economic value of mining. Morgan Stanley previously warned that the market could cut in half for virtual currency mining GPU when the main event of the virtual currency changes from beatcore to dollar next year.Bitcoin ]vivid@yna.co.kr Woo Byung-woo (50, former chief of the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae) arrested for requesting bail in Seoul = New South Korean and Japanese daily Na Un-chae = an illegal inspection.

"[Battery Gate to Credibility] This battery explanation won't work at all ... U.S. media outlets have shown that the same delays in rolling out the popular Apple trusted new products and the same old supply chain last year. When Apple admitted yesterday that it intentionally slowed down the iPhone released from 2014 to last year, customers began turning their backs on Apple, filing collective lawsuits against it. As the postponement and quality debate continues over the launch of new products, the power of products is being questioned. Time, a leading U.S. weekly magazine, said consumer confidence in Apple is at risk, adding, It is fatal for Apple, built on loyalty and positive perceptions of consumers.◇ Consumer expectation after consumer expectation … Have lost faith in Apple, and the ` battery gate ` crisis is not easy to explain. "" Software updates limit the speed of the iPhone, as an older battery can turn off the iPhone due to poor performance, "" Apple said. But economics magazine Forbes stated, "" Samsung Electronics assured us that the lithium ion batteries in the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8 will hold 95 % of the maximum capacity in two years, and neither did LG and Google. "" "" Smartphones batteries lose their capacity as they age, but their voltage rarely drops, "" an official at a battery company said. "" There is no reason for the battery to turn off. ""In addition, as of July 24, Apple's actions have been obtained through a collective lawsuit in New York, California and Illinois. "" Apple slowed down to cover up the battery malfunction most iPhones, "" one California sued. "" This is a serious betrayal of trust that must be established between businesses and consumers, "" said Jidinet, an IT professional media outlet.Already last year, Apple had been criticized as "" not the same. "" Apple announced in September last year that it would release the Bluetooth earphone "" Airpat "" in October of that year, but it postponed it for no apparent reason. Until then, the Wall Street Journal and other foreign news agencies called it a rare mistake by Apple, saying it was the first time Apple delayed the release of its key product since the iPhone 4 in 2010. Apple, however, failed to keep its promise to release its first AI speaker home plate by June this year. Last month, with the launch of the strategy smartphone "" X., "" the company had to wait five to six weeks for its customers to receive the product because it failed to properly procure components. Bloomberg then criticized, "" Problems like production delays are no longer uncommon at Apple. ""◇ The growing supply chain and confidentiality of Apple products raises the stakes in the Apple products, and experts point out that the controversy has occurred because its product lines have grown larger and it can not handle the worldwide distribution chain. According to Bloomberg, Apple produced 14 products in 2010, one year before its chief executive officer, Tim Cook, 57, took office. Seven years later, as of May this year, the number of devices around the world including earphones has increased to 27. When combined with the detailed models of each country, the number of models is 200. In addition, the supply chain was further complicated as Apple diversified its parts supply lines, saying it would not be able to open up to several parts makers, including Samsung Electronics and Qualcomm.Apple's secrecy has also received criticism. Right after Apple released the iPhone 8 in September, there were cases in which Apple complained of "" battery swelling. "" Apple said in early October that it was "" investigating the issue, "" but has not offered an explanation for more than two months. Last month, the problem was that when the iPhone X was operating in a cold environment, the screen would freeze for several seconds. U.S. media have called it the ' Cold Gate (Cold + Watergate) ' and raised the issue broadly, but Apple posted a message on its website, "" Use it in a location where the ambient temperature is between 0 ℃ and 35 ℃. "" When the weather turns cold, the battery becomes discharged, so be careful. `` Apple does not even display proper product specifications such as battery capacity or storage capacity on its home page, '' Time magazine said. `` I will give you the information you need to know. '' "" Lack of transparency is driving iPhone users to frustration and rage, "" the BBC television network said. "" Apple should be more truthful with its customers.

Also, the market capitalization of Pearl Urby nearly doubled to 2.6 trillion won in three months from 1.22 trillion won in initial public offering in September.The rise in market capitalization of the two game makers is due to strong performance and expectations among investors that existing services and new releases will do a good job both here and abroad.■ Improving working conditions, Crunch mode, which requires compulsory work such as playing computer games and overtime, was put on the surface and improved the working conditions of each game company.Crunch mode has long been an industry established practice, but was blamed and pointed specifically at by a few game publishers for their high-lighting work environment.Nevertheless, this year, each game company tried to provide a working environment that would make employees feel comfortable by performing elastic work or applying forced commuting. This environment was centered on the big and middle-sized players.■ e-Sports, new winds, and new winds have broken into the e-sports market.This year, the official e-sports league will start in January, as Blizzard Entertainment's popular over-watching competition is receiving the spotlight.

The evaluation of the status of the superior general hospital at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital, where four newborns were killed simultaneously in an intensive care unit, was postponed.The Health and Welfare Ministry announced Monday that it has reviewed 51 hospitals nationwide that applied for designation as hospitals of the 3rd term (2018 - 2020) and selected 41 out of 43 hospitals and one out of eight hospitals that applied for new treatment.High-ranking hospitals refer to hospitals that specialize in high-difficulty medical activities for serious illnesses. Introduced in 2011, it is assigned every three years based on absolute assessment and relative assessment of the size of medical personnel, the proportion of patients who work in intensive care, the level of securing of medical doctors, and quality of medical services.If you are designated as a senior general hospital, you can receive a higher price even though you practice medical treatment since you can get an additional rate of 30 percent for health insurance.The designated hospitals are 13 in Seoul, 4 in the northwest, 4 in Gyeonggi Province, 1 in the south, 3 in North Chungcheong Province, 2 in South Chungcheong Province, and 5 in South Jeolla Province.The number of hospitals in North Gyeongsang Province increased by one, and the number of hospitals in South Gyeongsang Province decreased by one.

As disaster after disaster occurs on the sea (fishing boat), the air (crane), and land (fire), the current administration's disaster safety system that promised to "" Republic of Korea "" is not functioning properly. Police said Monday that firefighters went to the scene without even preparing plans for the building. Moreover, the rescue delay caused by the illegal parking lot and the fact that there are many people in sauna on the second floor resulted in 20 victims in sauna on the second floor. As a result, criticism was raised that the initial response was insufficient.Firemen also ignored the landlord's recommendation that the doors (screen doors), sprinklers, fire doors, and other facilities should be flame-proof on exterior wall finishes without any improvement. The parking lot and the doors on the first floor were made of glass and acted as chimney, and no fire doors were installed on the first floor steps. Another reason is that the heat lamps (heat insulation, etc.) and heat rays were installed in order to prevent the pipes from being dislodged on the first floor, and plastic, not insulation, were also added. Regarding this, fire department professor Lee Chang-woo at Soong-sil University in Seoul said, "" Because of the use of plastic and not non-combustible, the ceiling was attached horizontally and the fire spread rapidly in front of a vertical plane. ""Although multI-use facilities were used, they were illegally used as a warehouse in front of the emergency exit on the second floor and for a terrace on the 8th or 9th floors. Critics also said that the cargo lift intensified the fire, causing nine deaths on the sixth and seventh floors alone, and also fueling anger over the careless building review. We have used the first floor and parking lot walls as glass doors and repurposed them into storehouses, patios and residential rooms without doors, although we don`t know how this was approved by the construction deliberation. The company's recent inspections on fire fighting areas also point to the lack of inspections of second floor warehouses, nine-story rooftop, and fire prevention facilities as causes of the fire.The government revised the law to prevent the use of dry bit finishes in pilotis over 6 floors from 2015. However, there is no reason to improve the quality of flame protection in previous structures and there is no need for improvement in fires. A joint investigation team of police and fire department is known to point to poor electricity construction by building owners as the primary cause of the blaze. Lee pointed out that all pilotis that do not use non-furnished materials should be reinforced and mandatory involvement by fire fighters from construction committee discussions.

At that time, Buyeo was a hub of East Asian culture that joins China and Japan, and all of the world's major luxury items including Baekje's gilt-bronze shamps and gold sarira bottles were also created. However, the capital city was captured by the Union of Na Dang in 660, and the history of the loser was distorted and its cultural superiority was lost. So much of Baekje culture in the Sabi era is still shrouded in mystery. This means that there are many cultural assets that remain dormant in the ground, not yet opened. The excavation research conducted by Buyeo-gun and the Baekje Foundation for the High Level Culture has brought out evidence of the site of the Baekje Sabi Building in its latest excavation project. The Cultural Heritage Administration (Director of the Cultural Heritage Administration) confirmed yesterday that large-scale land construction facilities (such as a building for construction) were built in the area of Hwajisan Mountain and Samyeon, southwest of the capital.The Buyeo HwajI Oil Field is an important monument to Baekje along with Busosanseong Fortress and Gwanbuk-ri ruins that were listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Since it has been reported that there have been two sites, Manhaejeong and Eojeong, which are known to be sites of interest, a major facility of Baekje has been proposed. HwajI Oil Company also conducted an emergency search in 2000 by the Buyeo National Research Institute for Cultural Heritage. The research also revealed pottery and bone fragments from the Unified Silla cremation, as well as earthen tombs from the Goryeo to Joseon Dynasty, as well as the Buddhist pagodas from the Baekje Kingdom and the Silla cremation equipment that were used during the Goryeo Dynasty.

The CEBR's ranking is in dollar terms. The CEBR said China is expected to significantly change its ranking as some Asian countries move forward, including the United States, which overtook it in 2032 to become the number one hope. The Indian economy, currently ranked seventh, is forecast to jump from Britain and France to fifth next year, and from Japan and Germany to third in 2027, with a jump to third place, respectively. By 2032, China, India and Japan will be among the four largest economies. The CEBR said India will not stop and reach No.1 in the latter half of the century. Indonesia, which is currently ranked 16th, is also expected to move into 10th place by 2032. In contrast, Italy and Canada, two of the seven major countries (G7), are expected to be eliminated in the top 10 by 2032, according to the CEBR's forecast.

Kim Sang-hee, head of Aging Society on Aging Society (the president) conference held at Cheong Wa Dae, 26, vice chairman of the Committee is of a new government's low birthrate policy directions like this.ReportedThe Commission respects individual choice of ` marriage, childbirth ` and other human rights policies aimed at the number of children born out of wedlock to respond to low or elderly societies, and respects ` human rights choices based on birth control `.It also plans to implement policies to make the system more proactive and responsive to macro trends, such as changes in population structure and the fourth industrial revolution, instead of just boosting the birth rate.At the same time, the Commission plans to strengthen its role as a communication platform so that it can serve as a window for communicating diverse opinions centered on parties.The Commission selected ‘ Happy people with future hope ’ as its vision and continued to respond to Δ day and life balance Δ stable and equal female jobs, Δ employment, housing, and education reform, and Δ support for all children and their families as the four directions for low birth rates.We will make the key tasks to balance our lives first, Kim said, adding that the key tasks under consideration are to be carefully supplemented by future committees and announced on the roadmap early next year. In consideration of the urgency of the low birth rate, the Commission announced a ‘ roadmap for responding to low birth rates ’ in the first quarter of next year and is planning to re-opening the third basic plan for low birth rates and the aged society by the third quarter of next year (2016 - 2020).Specifically, the Government's original effort to reduce childcare hours by three hours was made, ranging from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., to encourage children to take off without pay, and to encourage workers to work without pay by one hour. The government will secure time for the children and their parents to spend together by activating flexible work such as the staggered hours. Considering the wage cut (80 percent income replacement rate) and the difficulty of managing the workforce due to a 3-hour cut, the ministry said it was considering a more convenient way to apply the system. The committee will also look into alternative support measures to encourage small businesses to actively participate.In addition, men with children under the age of two can take a short childcare leave that can be used for a total of 30 days to encourage fathers to take active childcare leave. The maternity leave is 20 days, 10 days per year, and 3 days of paid maternity leave can be extended to 10 days, which is not a planned two days ' leave, but a full day's leave.In the past, the government raised the pay for childcare leave from 40 percent to 50 percent of the usual wage, and increased the amount of incentives for childcare leave by 200,000 won to 700,000 to 1.2 million won.However, some point out that it is necessary to come up with practical measures to deal with the problem of decreasing income, poor use of childcare leave by business cultures and men.To make paternity leave universal, we will prepare reform measures for childcare leave, including assessing the suitability of wage levels, while expanding implementation activities from government ministries and public agencies, Kim said. The Commission also decided to prepare a measure to provide maternity support to enhance the maternity and childcare rights of non-employed women. To support female re-employment, the medical institution operates a participle-case management success package and strengthens the tax support for stock companies.To solve the ' caring cliff ' problem in the lower grades of elementary schools, the government is planning to strengthen primary care and connections to secondary schools, and to prepare and spread a cooperative care model between schools and the local communities.As for strengthening the public awareness of childcare for infants and children, the government also plans to implement the expansion of 40 percent of the nationwide children's homes through new installations and private purchases.Report to the National Youth Service : [Untraded reproduction and redistribution of news 1 Korea (news1.kr),] : Monthly income of low-income young households in their 20s increased by 780,000 won last year, increased by only less than 800,000 won, and proved that there was an increase in non-regular workers ' incomes by just 300,000 won and flexibility in the labor market last year. The problem of youth poverty is getting worse, the 880,000 won generation is becoming obsolete and the 770,000 won generation is coming up soon (the first page report of the Kyunghyang Newspaper, December 22, 2016).Low-paid youth, in the data of the Household Finance and Welfare Survey of the 21st century of the National Statistical Office, last year's stock price was less than 30 years old and the average monthly income level of households in the bottom 20 percent. These households also have a teen-age household, but very few and mostly 20-somethings.Monthly incomes for low-income young households under the age of 30 have been dropping since 2013. Last year, the price dropped from 908,000 won in 2013 to 810,000 won in 2014 and 806,000 won in 2015, but it was not as high as 800,000 won for the first time. Among those under the age of 30, the proportion of annual income of less than 10 million won (less than 830,000 won per month) increased from 4.4 percent in 2013 to 8.1 percent last year.Statistics show that the rise in low-income young households is due to the increase in single-person households due to the spread of individualism. More single people are finding it difficult to earn enough money to support themselves and feel financially challenged. A more fundamental cause, however, is the unresolved issue of non-regular youth.There are still many non-regular workers at young age, and many are concerned about their livelihood due to the low pay. Especially in the pre-chamber jobs, such as fashion and design, the passion pay habit remains for young people. In a recent survey of 200 stylists, the Seoul branch of the Korean Federation of Women's Unions, 28.5 percent of respondents said they receive 500,000 won per month. Many of the respondents said they work long hours."" By mid-month-month, I wasn't able to afford a meal because I was down, and I wasn't able to afford food, "" says the clothing assistant, who said, "" but the mood in the industry wasn't changing. Internership at a fashion company, Hun, also said, I don`t have any changes in my salary even when the media report goes over my head.In the past, governments used to raise their voices, saying, "" I will resolve the problem of youth poverty whenever it raises, "" but the priority of policies was delayed. In particular, the flexibility of the labor market, which was emphasized by the conservative government, has hurt the younger generation the most. Park Geun-hye, the government average wage is higher ‘Increased earned income tax’ that gives tax breaks to companies in 2014 and introduce a temporary but emphasized the improvement.The following year, the human resources management flexibility and setback, such as the removal of restrictions on use of temporary workers and dispatched.Moon Jae-in, the government leading and income growth underlines the troubleshooting of jobs for young people, but ‘generation of 77 million won’ still uncertain if he could block the reality. The problem of non-regular workers for young people and low wages is a chronic phenomenon with growing job insecurity, said University President Park Woong-kee, who should continue to make efforts to increase quality jobs by solving job matchmarks."
"Seohangi Support Notice Revision (Seoul=Communist News), a small business establishment that provides pension benefits for low-income workers and employers with less than 10 employees will receive up to 90 percent of the national pension insurance premium from the government. The Ministry of Health and Welfare announced yesterday that it revised its public notice to provide pension insurance benefits to low-income workers at small workplaces and to enforce it from January 2018. The income standard for the so-called Durunuri Pension Schemes Service will be extended to those who will apply for the pension by more than 1.9 million won per month, up from the current 1.4 million won per month. The Durunuri project is a general project to provide employment insurance and national pension premiums to low-income workers working at small businesses from July 2012 to resolve blind spots on social insurance. The revision will increase the support rate for new pension insurance premiums from the existing 60 percent to up to 90 percent depending on the size of the operations. Specifically, between 1 and 4 new members of the business establishment and 80 % of the new subscribers of the business sites with 5-9 employees receive support among the pension insurance premium paid by the users and workers. Reflecting the nature of irregular workers ` hiring, such as frequent changes in jobs, the company eased discrimination against non-regular workers by revising the criteria for entering the workplace from the previous three years to one year. In addition, the ' insurance premium support history ' was deleted from the list of new subscribers ' requirements, allowing more vulnerable people to receive pension benefit. However, non-new subscribers (such as those with national pension service sign - up process) receive 40 % of the pension insurance premium paid by users and workers regardless of the size of their operations. The reform resulted from the intention of the Durunuri Social Insurance fund support project, which is aimed at expanding the number of new subscribers to Social Insurance. As a result of this action, about 147,000 people who receive 60 percent of pension insurance premiums as of 2017 could be cut from 60 percent to 40 percent of pension insurance premium support. However, the pension insurance benefits were not significantly reduced to around 16,000 won per worker, considering the increase in the wage levels in 2018, when the lowest wage will be around 730 won per hour.Get job insurance and pension support for 2.25 million low-wage workers next year [Combined News Network] shg@yna.co.kr [Commissions report to the United Nations] ▶ Trump Administration slashed $ 280 million (307.3 billion won) from its two years of budget on the United Nations from 2018 to 19-year budget, AP reported on Tuesday (local time).

"The duty-free shop is still packed with hotel reservations.[Asian business reporter Kim Hyun-jung, reporter Lee Seon-ae and journalist Cho Ho-yoon] ["" Do you agree that the prohibition on selling Korean tour products has been lifted? "" As a group, less than a thousand Chinese tourists will arrive in a month. '' Although the conflict between Korea and China over the deployment of the high-altitude missile defense system is yet to resolve. There is no group tour bus visible in the parking lot of duty-free shops, and the four-star hotel where Chinese usually stay is still empty. As the market is suffering from a long drought, Myeong-dong's commercial district is known to have begun to renew its business. According to the industry on July 26, it has been about a month since the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China allowed the trip to Korea, but the domestic tourism and distribution market did not recognize it. China held a local conference on July 28 and allowed regular travel agencies in Beijing and Shandong to visit Korea for the first time. The hotel industry said in unison, "" There is no genuine return of Chinese tourists to China. "" More than 10 five-star hotels in Seoul that are highly dependent on Youker now have almost no reservation for Young.Rooker, the first hotel in Seoul to be opened by Grand Hotel in 262 days since the last 2 days "" Our hotel has 80 percent of all Chinese tourists, and after the ban, we still have less than 10 percent of all hotel reservation in China, "" said an official of a 4 star hotel.As Chinese who spend less on accommodation and accommodation go to business hotels in the middle of the year, it is more difficult to find a shadow of Youker in such five-star hotels as Shilla, Chosun, and the Plaza. Lotte Hotel is known to have been excluded from lifting the ban, so there has been no change at all. There will be significant number changes starting next year`s Chinese holidays and the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, an official at the luxury hotel said. The duty-free shop industry, in which the number of kioskers and profit margins are virtually interlinked, is in a similar vein. There was not a single large bus for group tourists in the parking lot of Lotte Duty Free Shop on July 25. Instead, dozens of Carnival cars were parked around. Industry sources say the car is mainly designed to carry only the royal carriage with five members in attendance. Industry watchers say the duty free shop is more crowded recently than it was a month ago, as the discount store owners actually moved faster to make final demands, adding, "" This is why they are waiting in line. "" "" The number of tourists who could be called Youker would be less than 1,000 in recent months, "" he said, stressing that the lifting of the ban is not yet a dramatic improvement over the past years.On March 27, when the Chinese company was in the middle of a retaliation against the THAAD system, an advertisement was posted on the exterior of Lotte Department Store in central Seoul that said, ' I understand you, and I will wait for you. '(Photo : Munonam, a journalist, and Munonam) The atmosphere of the tourism market is not very different, either. On the same day, some Chinese appeared on the streets of central Myeongdong, Jung-gu, but the majority of them were small individual tourists and parcel dealers. Although it was partly due to the cold weather, no flag-waver units were visible anywhere on the roadside. However, the demand for Korean products remained. In front of the MCM store, more than 20 people lined up to purchase the limited edition of the spring and summer (S/C) next year. "" If you see a video clip of a Chinese friend and like it, you are waiting to buy one instead, "" one Chinese woman said. Considering the timing of the retaliation after the THAAD, stores in Myeong-dong were in the process of renewing their stores. Sun-color Estula, a color brand in Amore Pacific on Myeongdong-gil, underwent a renovation last month, with the firm in the middle of the month. Hedges Myeongdong store in LF companies will begin a long-term renewal project at the end of next month. The cosmetics brand stores, which saw their earnings decline by 30-50 percent after the THAAD retaliation, are still improving. "" The number of kioskers in Korea has partly increased since the ban was lifted, but it is hard to say it is a recovery, "" said an official at a major cosmetics brand shop in Seoul, hoping to create a similar atmosphere next year. China's move to resume the ban is also a major source of anxiety for the industry. Local travel agencies are rumored to have decided to rebase group tours to Korea and sent them to some companies. It is also worrisome that it is not possible to get a clear picture since it is not an official sanction as it was in the notice of the ban in the past.

Once remodeled, it will be the first time for the Self Defense Forces to possess an aircraft carrier. The Maritime Self-Defense Forces is seeking to operate U.S. military's latest stealth fighter jet, the F235B, that can take off short distances and land vertically when converted into an aircraft carrier. It is believed to be aimed at responding to China`s threat to strengthen cooperation and strengthen its maritime operations, as well as North Korea, which repeatedly makes provocative moves between the two countries. According to the official Japanese government, it is not allowed to have attack aircraft carriers, intercontinental ballistic missiles or long-range strategic bombers available in terms of total defense. Therefore, the government is likely to determine that the conversion of Izumo into an aircraft carrier does not violate the original stance by establishing it as a defensive aircraft carrier, not as an attack, but an argument is expected. Meanwhile, Defense Minister Onodera Itsunori said, "" We are not considering converting Izumo into an aircraft carrier at the moment, "" adding, "" Considering the security environment, we are reviewing ways to maintain our security.
