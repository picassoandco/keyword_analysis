"○ Steel Pillotti Building It is a four-story building in Jangseong-dong with its first floor parking lot bent and broken like a taffy, an apartment in Heunghae-eup with its buildings tilted to one side, and a building with outer walls that fell down. The reporters, along with Kim Seung-jik, a professor of construction and anti-seismic design specialist at Kyejeong University, Shinkyeongjae University, and officials from the Korean construction and rescue organizations, checked the damages at the scene.Daeseong Apt., Pohang Heunghae-eup, two kilometers from the epicenter on July 16. One of the six-story apartments that were completed in 1987 had a tilt of 15 centimeters to the north (near the surface). The lower part of the veranda on the first floor had a gap of more than 30cm when the concrete was dropped. There were two or three loose strands of reinforcement. The other five outer walls were also badly fractured. There are no columns inside the apartment, said Shin. It is designed to withstand loading only from walls to maximize interior space, '' he said. The walls must be strong in this structure. However, cracks were so big that my hands even went into the inner walls. Jeong Kwang-ryang, president of the Korean architectural structural technology society, said, We have only done basic construction to build longitudinal bars without lateral reinforcement. The outer wall is also thin, with a length of 15cm. Empty spaces were visible behind the bars that had splattered through the gaps. It is not filled with steel and concrete. The anti-seismic design was required in 1988, the year after the completion of the apartment. There are 39 apartments not earthquake-proof in Pohang.Residents say the quake, which occurred on July 15, has a five-story Daeseong apartment building in Pohang City, North Gyeongsang Province, tilted to the left as if it were the Tower of Pisa. Building access is completely blocked due to the danger of collapse, and residents are evacuated to nearby gyms. / The new apartment building was also vulnerable to earthquakes. Apartments on the 21st floor in Yangdeok-dong, Seoul, which began to move in last June, were also cracked with the exterior walls and dentuded of cement. "" I don't have a big structural problem, but I haven't done my best with the exterior tiles, "" said Professor Shin. In front of the entrance to the apartment was a notice posted the previous day by the management office, "" My apartment is earthquake resistant, class 1. ""When we took a look around the scene on July 16, Kim Bu-kyum, the Minister of Public Administration and Security, said, The situation was much worse than I expected. I will suggest to the Cabinet that it designate the areas as areas of special disaster. Pohang Earthquake Ground Motion Sizes 5.4, which was smaller than last year's Gyeongju earthquake (5.8), were damaged due to the impact of the earthquake, which was delivered directly to the ground with a depth of 9 kilometers. Many of the buildings damaged by the strong earthquake in Pohang were originally designed in error. Inherent diseases such as poor construction were also blamed for increasing the damages from the earthquake.◇ Filroty Building Seismic Design Failure, ’’ a four-story building in Jangseong-dong, Pohang, built in 2011 with a "" pilotis technique "" in which the first floor is to be turned into a parking lot and the second floor is to be raised. Three of the eight pillars supporting the building were bent with the iron bar exposed. Inside the exposed columns, lateral reinforcement (transverse reinforcement) was visible. To withstand a quake like Pohang, the crossbars should have a cooler spacing than the thickness of a column, Kim said. The reporters measured the square column with a ruler and found that it was about 30cm thick and that the horizontal root clearance was about 32cm to 33cm. Critical Pilotis - A strong earthquake in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, broke down and bent building columns built with the Fillotti technique were damaged. Officials of the Korean architectural structural technical community are checking the building conditions on July 16. / There was another problem with the reporter of Namgang. The thickness of the concrete around the pillars was about 10cm. A thicker concrete means a thinner central pillar is the same as steel, Kim said. "" A proper building would crack in the upper and lower boundaries of a column when a strong earthquake occurred, so it would not break in the middle of the building, "" he said.The pilotis method is inherently earthquake prone. If they are to endure an earthquake, they need to be connected with columns from the first floor to the top of the building. Most Korean people, however, have built columns on the first floor only and put walls on them. This was not the only pilotie building damaged by the earthquake. The pillars of another two-story building in Jangseong-dong were all cracked or broken out of concrete, showing a bundle of bars. Inside the pillars, there was an "" X "" shaped crack one meter across. Such a crack is far more dangerous than the cracks, Kim said. If they are hit hard by aftershocks or another shock, the concrete can break down like glass. Professor Kim said, The studio here was built in a similar fashion at the same time. The same damage can occur at any time when aftershocks hit, warned.◇ Handongdae, where the wall brick has collapsed due to poor construction, was pointed out as a failure in masonry. On July 16, on the side of the fifth floor lecture room, the Nohemiya Hall, was free from bricks stacked up on the four to five stories tall. If you look at the structure, it shows a few bumps in the steel. The problem is that the steel bars are not properly connected to bricks, said a report by an undertaker of bricks or an undertaker of experts who oversees them. At several places on the campus, you could see a pile of bricks lying off the wall, scattered like knives. It is what happened when bricks were applied to the wall of a building with adhesive only on the edges. Professor Shin and other investigators said, How did we do this? It is really bad.Masonry work on the walls of libraries, first public schools, and student halls resulted in poor masonry. "" An earthquake could cause deformation of windows, which could easily break open or someone at the bottom could get hurt, "" Shin said. Boilers on the first floor of the annex building were leaking oil.The University of Han Dong was founded in 1995. Meanwhile, POSTEC, which was founded in 1986, was hit by a drop in the water supply on the day of the earthquake and was hit by a power outage in some areas. Although some were close to the epicenter, it looked as if the university collapsed because it failed to complete the finishing touches. Some buildings have had their walls fractured and fractured diagonally by two meters. We can see some buildings with body problems, not just outer walls. We need a thorough diagnosis. A was taken to a nearby hospital by the 119 emergency service after being reported to a resident, but was eventually killed. In the suicide note found on the scene, a note was found in the form of a suicide note titled ' Look at my computer, ' police said. The document was found to have been saved on the computer. The parent said, My son has been being bullied at school since early this year and has been treated for depression. Police are investigating whether or not the school was violent based on documents left by the soldier. lkh@newsis.com>"
"Pohang Red Sea Structural Engineers Within Daeseong Red Sea, which leans toward safety inspections, and the Safety Management Association of the Building Structure Society and Safety Council in Pohang Building, it is very unlikely that it will be possible for the Korean residents to move in soon with the "" safety inspection team of experts "" in this condition Korean architectural rescue society chairman Chung Kwang-ryang and other anti-seismic engineering experts began a safety check on buildings affected by the earthquake on July 15 with officials from the Korean Ministry of Health, Infrastructure and Social Affairs. It is to see if the residents are allowed to live. The reporter covered the group. The first stop was Daeseong Apt. in Heunghae-eup, Buk-gu, Pohang, which was hit by the 5.4 earthquake. The apartment is made up of six apartments (260 generations) with five stories. Two of them experienced cracks and fractures in the east, and one of them leans about 4 degrees to the rear, with the floor lifted. Police were in control of the entrance to the fractured apartment building, but residents continued to visit the apartment to pick up their belongings. As I entered the park, I could see broken veranda concrete and broken glass in pieces. The wall of the veranda of Daeseong apartments was torn apart. Choi Eun-kyung, a reporter, especially one apartment with an angle of around 4 degrees looked precarious, with the front of the apartment leaning backward. As I entered this neighborhood, the floor felt like I was trampling on a trampoline every time I stepped off. Actual floor sticking out or unselected. The slope sloped over and I put a round object on it, and it went by itself. The air conditioner was standing on its face. The closet was empty and all kinds of paragliders were rolling on the floor. At each corridor and inside the house I could see a terrible crack. In many places, tiles fell and the front door was crushed out of business. Chairman Chung Kwang-ryang put his hand in between the cracks and tilted his head, "" Oh, I can't see the reinforcing steel. "" Reinforcing bars could not be found even in cracks in the wall on the first floor. When I looked closely, I could see broken bars on both sides. Gap on the outer wall of Daeseong Apartment. Experts say they do not see any reinforcement to be continued. If steel reinforcement is a frame but can not connect with each other or be connected in the middle, it is easy to crack down on the quake, said Kim Eun-kyung, an associate professor at Kangwon University, an architecture and engineering department at the university. Kim Jin-koo, vice president of the Korea Earthquake Engineering Association, looked out on the broken veranda, said, "" It was a short wall between generations and was not an earthquake resistant brick. "" Considering the sound of the building from the floor, there may be a problem with the construction, said Kim Jin-koo, vice chairman of the building. Apartment residents who met during the safety check complained to the group, I don`t know whether to rebuild or what to do. Officials at Pohang City Hall asked if residents were allowed to enter their homes. Experts say, Additional inspections are needed, but we have seen that it is difficult for people to live with and should be eliminated. Earthquake Engineering experts are inspecting multiplex housing in Jangseong-dong, Buk-gu on the afternoon of July 16. Choi Eun-kyung changed his position to look for multiplex houses with a structure of pilotic structures in Jangseong-dong, Buk-gu. Experts are also paying keen attention to the building because it is vulnerable to earthquakes. A makeshift steel frame supported the building instead of the broken post. As soon as experts saw the building, they said, "" The building that could have been damaged is broken. "" Most of all, the wall with its doors is too close to one corner. "" A building with a pilotis structure is under force at the center of the quake, but its resistance is twisted and shaken because of the wall. That is why the column on the far side of the wall has been badly damaged, Kim explained. Broken Columns in the Fillotti Structure Building Engineering chief Han Yong-seop, who had been watching the steel bars exposed by Choi Eun-kyung, said, "" Normally, the column sheath (on concrete and steel reinforcement) is reduced by more than 40 millimeters. Because the overlap between the bars is short and the bars surrounding them are not properly tightened, the steel bars were thrown sideways as a force was applied from above, Kim explained. Another problem was the plastic drain pipe between the steel bars. But it appears to be possible to restore the structure by placing a wall against the edge of the building and reinforcing the columns, Han said. The column is broken and the steel bars are clearly visible. After touring several pilotless buildings with damaged columns for reporters Choi Eun-kyung, Park Jeong-woo, director of Bun-gujo Engineering, said, It is very dangerous and dangerous to have any kind of repair done to get tenants on the spot right now. Since the quake wave is very complicated, asymmetric structures such as the pilotis can be dangerous even if they are earthquake-proof, Kim said. On July 17, when the earthquake hit, Daeseong Apt. "" Even the PilottI building is not all dangerous for earthquakes, "" said Woo Sang-jo reporter20171117. When building the PilottI building on the third or fifth floor, it is advisable to get a safety check from a structural engineer. Regarding the building of the university, experts say, "" It looks like bricks attached to outside were shaken sideways and crashed. "" Without or with a few hardware reinforcements to connect bricks and concrete inside, they could collapse during an earthquake, Kim said. After they have settled with Pohang City, they plan to conduct a thorough safety check.

At the scene, a ' thoughtful icon ' appeared. The main character is a young boy who is believed to be around five years old.An earthquake measuring 7.3 on the border of the northwestern Iran of the country of Khermansha and Iraq killed around 530 people and injured 8200 others. More than 30,000 homes were destroyed and more than 70,000 people were left homeless.Iranian officials at Red Crescent were on the scene delivering aid and food aid to the victims, as were the victims of an earthquake that left one of the most affected people in the five-year-olds.A video clip released recently shows a boy holding a girl of his age holding hands to approach an employee of the Red Crescent. Witnesses at the time told her to take food from a friend, she told a volunteer, I have not given her anything to eat.The volunteer immediately took the lunch box and the coke and handed them to the girl, who did not touch her friend's arm and gave him a pat on the back while he returned to his seat.The volunteers who had admired the sight took the boy to see off their friend and prepared the same lunch box and another coke, which made him leave with the prettiest smile in the world.The video spread when one of the volunteers on the scene took it with a smartphone and uploaded it on to social networking sites.

Since the announcement of the real estate measures, many people have argued that it is necessary to increase the property tax for multiple residents, but the Strategy and Finance Ministry (Minister Kim Dong-yeon) has been cautious.About half of the households in Korea are homeless. Meanwhile, the number of households with more than two homes increased by 100,000, further worsening the property department's poverty. According to the 2015 Householder Data Show released by the National Statistical Office, the number of homeless Koreans stood at 862,400 as of last year, or 44.5 percent of the total households (3,608 million). Homeless households saw a 0.5 percent increase (212,000 points) from the previous year (8,842,000 households). Seoul's homeless households were the highest with 50.7 percent (1,921,000), and Ulsan's households were the lowest with 37.4 percent (159,000).Meanwhile, the number of multiple home owners has increased. The total number of households with more than two houses stood at 289,000, 168,000 more than the previous year's 2,925,000. The number of two-house households rose from 2,800 to 2,117,000, three-house households grew from 454,000 to 493,000, and four-house households rose from 125,000 to 137,000. In particular, the number of households with more than 10 homes increased. The number of households with 11 to 20 units increased from 5,000 to 6,000 with 10 houses, from 24,000 to 25,000. As many as 3,000 households owned more than 51. In order of households with more than two houses, Gyeonggi Province (642,000), Seoul (521,000), and Gyeongnam (209,000 households) ranked first. Among the households with more than two homes, Jeju (32.7 percent), Sejong (31.6 percent), and Chungnam (30 percent) were the most expensive. Gangnam-gu, Seocho-gu, Incheon, Ongjin-gun, and Yeonggwang-gun were ranked as cities with 36.1 percent, followed by Jung-gu with 40.6 percent and Yeonggwang-gun with 38 percent. Data = National Statistical Office] [Data = National Statistical Office] Choi Hun-gil (choigiga@edaily.co.kr) Meanwhile, the average home ownership rate of the baby boomer in their 50s and 60s was over 60 percent, showing a gap between them.In addition, the number of single-person households rose by more than 200,000 in a year last year.According to the National Statistical Office's report on the year 2016 Housing Ownership Statistics, among those in their 30s (30-39) last year, 1.87 million households (58.3 %) were homeless. Among the households in their 30s, only 1,344,000 households owned a house, while 41.7 percent owned a house. House-owned households saw a decrease of 46,000 households compared to 2015 (139 million households), and the housing ownership rate decreased by 0.7 % (p) point per year.Families in their 20s had less housing than their 30s. Among 139,000 households last year, only 152,000 (11 percent) owned homes and 127,000 (89 percent) were homeless. Housing ownership in the 20s fell by 3%p from a year earlier, the biggest decline in all age groups.It seems to reflect the fact that the age of marriage is being delayed, and that it is becoming harder to own a house at the start of marriage due to the increase in housing prices. Unlike the early 20s and 30s, when households were born, the average ownership rate of houses in their 50s and 60s was 60 % or higher.In particular, people in their 60s had the highest housing ownership rate (68.9 percent) among all age groups, with 2.08 million households owning homes. The report also showed that 70-67.8 percent of apartments were owned by people, 62.7 percent by people in their 50s, and 57.5 percent by people in their 40s.The 60-somethings recorded an increase of 5.3 % (105,000 households) per year, the second highest growth rate following those over 80 (11.2 %). Meanwhile, those in their 20s and 30s saw their home ownership households decreased 20.1 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively.Last year, the total number of homeless households stood at 862,500, a 2.5 percent increase from the previous year's 8,841,000 households.Among the total households, the proportion of homeless households stood at 44.5 percent, up by 0.5 percent from 44 percent a year earlier. Meanwhile, the share of houses owned by the government last year was 55.5 percent, down by 0.5 percent from the previous year.The increase was attributed to the large increase in the number of single-person households without homes.Last year, the number of single-homeless households stood at 3,837,000, a 7.5 percent increase from 364,000 in 2003. Single-house households accounted for 45.2 percent of all homeless households.In particular, the size of the single-person households with no homes increased more than 257,000 last year, which is largely responsible for the increase in the number of homeless households.As a result, the number of single-person households rose significantly, and it appears that the total number of homeless people also increased, said Eun Hee-hoon, director of the office`s administrative statistics division."

Sinchangseop journalist Shin Chang-seop and journalist Park Hyung-dong were found to have hit the new town hard, dealing a side-shaped M blow with an earthquake centered on the epicenter. This shape is consistent with the long-deposited soft land, and Pohang City has promoted the development of new towns since the 2000s. Experts agree that the Pohang earthquake should lead to stronger inspections and designs of new towns built on the coast fill or soft ground. After researching the disaster safety headquarters in Pohang and the office and damage areas in Heunghae-eup, South Korea's most affected area is the quake's epicenter, Heunghae-eup. He then passed the Handong Univ. on the right of Heunghae-eup and moved the Jongmyo Shrine to the left to the new northern area, Jangnyang-dong (Jangseong-dong + Yangdeok-dong), and Hwangho-dong to Yongheung-dong. In particular, the damages were concentrated in the new town of Jangnyang-dong, which is built on the pulse layer within a 7- 8m radius of the epicenter and on the soft ground, contributing to the damage caused by fragile geological features. Pohang City urgently checked 45 earthquake-hit buildings, including Heunghae-eup and Jangnyang-dong, and ruled against the use of 18 buildings, including apartments and apartments. Professor of geology at Pusan National University said, "" Generally, damages to the ground are related to ground effects. The ground is usually bigger than the Gyeongju earthquake, so the ground damage is particularly severe in this area, and the ground damage is shallow, and the houses were submerged 10 million years ago "" As a result, new towns along the shores of the eastern part of the peninsula along the coast must strengthen anti-seismic design standards and inspections. Since some of the landfills in Pohang are heavily stacked, we need to plug the design and construction by installing 50 meters of paper to strengthen the bearing capacity of the construction. In fact, it was revealed that the number of people leaving Seoul after the real estate measures on August 2 was greatly increased. It is interpreted as an increasingly difficult influence on the building of homes in Seoul due to a series of government regulations on real estate and rate hikes.According to the National Statistical Office on July 17, the number of people who escaped from Seoul increased by 22.2 percent to 13,331 in September from the same month last year. The number of people who received net outflow from 6045 in June to 8243 and 8991 in August, respectively, but exceeded 10,000 for the first time this year.As housing prices continue to rise in Seoul, it is becoming harder to find homes for residents who need more than one house due to tougher regulations on real estate.According to the Korea Institute of Audit and Inspection, the average apartment sale price in Seoul last month stood at 544.46 million won, up 4.5 percent (25.15 million won) from a year earlier. Apartment prices in the Seoul metropolitan area rose 3.1 percent (11.87 million won) to total 399,522. On the other hand, apartments in the rest of the Seoul metropolitan area only rose 0.3 percent (590,000 won) in a year to an average price of 929.49 million won.Rental rates have shown a similar trend. The average rent in Seoul was 388.85 million won last month, 3.0 percent higher than a year ago. During the period, the Seoul Metropolitan area increased by 2.2 percent (59.9 million won) to 266.61 million won. Compared to this, the local area has remained substantially flat, rising 0.2 percent (290,000 won) to 114.48 million.It is hard for most office workers to make ends meet without paying a penny to buy a house in Seoul or to rent one. Because of this, most people buy their homes on loan. The problem is that it is also becoming harder to get a loan.As the entire Seoul area was locked down as speculation zones due to real estate measures, regulations on mortgage loans were tightened. Even those who do not have a home will have a mortgage loan ratio (LTV) and the debt-to-income debt ratio (DTI) of those who want to buy houses in Seoul are limited to 40 percent. The combined annual income of couples who earn less than 60 million won per year is reduced to 50 percent, but the rate is not much different. If you wanted an apartment worth 500 million won, you could borrow up to 350 million won, but now you can only get 250 million won. The remaining 250 million won has to be set up by the government, but it is not easy for ordinary people.Mortgage rates are also rising. According to the Bank of Korea, the bank's mortgage rate rose 0.44 percent to 3.24 percent in September from 2.80 percent a year earlier. In other words, if one pays 200 million won per year in housing security, one should pay 64.8 million won in interest per year. Adding the principal amount to this will make the payment even more burdensome.Under these circumstances, people are leaving Seoul in a row. According to the National Statistical Office, 140,000 to 257 people left Seoul last year. Among them, 136,603 people, or 97.3 percent, built nests in Gyeonggi-do. The number of people who left Seoul until September this year reached 58,840. During the same period, 72,927 people were literally brought into Gyeonggi Province. It is analyzed that this migration demand is responsible for the high competition among apartments in the Seoul Metropolitan area, whose prices are similar to the pre-Selling prices. The first round of applications for the post ended with 5304 people applying for the post for the 302-generation mobilization Royal Duke of Siheung City Hall in Gwangseok-dong, Seoul, on July 2. A more reasonable sale price of 395-425 million won based on the double railway zone area of Siheung City Hall and Yongseong Station and the dedicated area of 84 ㎡ is believed to be the reason of its popularity.We expect continued popularity among apartments in the Seoul metropolitan area, said an official of the real estate industry.Park Min-kyu, reporter yushin@asiae.co.kr"

Experts are different in whether the painting is really da Vinci's work or whether it is worth the money considering its preservation. Christie's, the auction house, said, "" I'm sure it was by Da Vinci, "" but not a few experts are claiming to object. AP reported on July 16 (local time) that some scholars regarded Salvator Moondi not as drawn by da Vinci but as a painting at the da Vinci Gallery. "" Some of da Vinci's works were in the studio, "" said Jack Frank, an art historian and an expert, estimating 15 percent participation. He pointed out that the shape of the hand in the painting did not reflect Da Vinci's profound knowledge in anatomy.

"" There were Muslim touchpoints in that book. Leonardo artist and art historian Jacques Frank also told New York City that it was "" a good studio with at best a little Leonardo and not a lot of damage, "" adding, "" It's called the male Mona Lisa. "" Philip Kenny Cut, an art reporter at the Washington Post, said, "" The high price of the work does not remove doubts about its authenticity, "" adding, "" It is safe to say that it was part of da Vinci's work rather than part of it.

As an art historian and dealer, Dr. Vendor Grosvener told The Guardian, The new and interesting ways of promoting Christie were effective. Christie led an unprecedented marketing campaign by selecting an outside agency before the auction to promote her work and holding exhibitions in Hong Kong, London, and New York. It is also believed to have been made in the 1500s, and brought to the auction market by rich and enthusiastic buyers of modern art. They point out that raising the price limit is not desirable for the entire art market.

"Jeon Byung-hun, Senior Presidential Secretary for Political Affairs at Cheong Wa Dae, who is suspected of illegally receiving donations at Lotte Home Shopping, is leaving for a car accident at Chunchu Hall Monday morning. As the confirmation of the president of the Constitutional Court and the Board of Audit and Inspection of Korea (BAI), and the search for a successor to President Jeon Byung-hun's office for handling the budget, Jeon Byung-hun, the senior secretary for political affairs for Cheong Wa Dae, continued to be criticized as saying, "" Cheong Wa Dae is still in dispute. "" However, given the situation at the National Assembly, it is widely expected that Cheong Wa Dae's real worries are just beginning. The former senior secretary for the morning on December 16, hold a press conference, ""today I'm going to tell president's resignation."" and said, "" No long time, but as best as a senior presidential aide to the efforts of the president.I tried to his eventually got trouble to make sure that I was so miserable, the ambassador said. It is the second time that Kim Ki-jung, the second deputy chief of the National Security Office, has offered to resign among the senior secretaries. It is the first time that he voluntarily resigned from the scandal. For the Blue House, Jeon was relieved to see that she avoided standing in front of the photo lines of the prosecution under her current title. I was being investigated to maintain the current status and greater morality of the Moon Jae-in, the government as a suspect can be a death blow. The presidential office has repeatedly called the issue not an issue with the incumbent administration, and has repeatedly distanced itself from the former chief of staff, which is interpreted as an effort to maintain the moral integrity of the incumbent administration. It is also concerned that the power of the cleanup and reform measures against enemy abuses could be reduced.

However, the analysis suggests that the fact that Jeon's departure from her post does not solve everything does not solve everything. The president is facing a tricky situation, including political figures and budget situation, the role of the then presidential chief of staff, considering the situation of the National Assembly, such as it is crucial. For the presidential office, it is necessary to find a senior secretary for political affairs who will serve as a bridge with the National Assembly, and solve the pending issues at the same time. The fact that he discussed his attitude with Chief of Staff Lim Jong-seok until the previous day is believed to have been meant to draw up a concrete alternative to Post-Specific. With Cheong Wa Dae in the run-up to appoint Hong Jong-hak, the chairman of the Constitutional Court and the chairman of the Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI) have come under fire. The three opposition parties, the Liberal Democratic Party, the Right Party, and the People's Party, are expected to file for the National Assembly's decision to send a repeat of Hong's confirmation hearing, and to deal with the remaining budget. The GNP floor spokesman Chung Tae-ok said, The push for the appointment was a challenge to the public, declaring an end to the alliance between the two, warning the presidential office against any possible delay in appointing a candidate.

As only former NIS chief Lee Byung-ho, who has served as NIS chief for the longest time, avoids arrest, attention is focused on the background of the arrest. They reportedly admitted to the fact that the special expenses were passed on to Cheong Wa Dae in investigating prosecutors and examining warrants. However, the court apparently judged that there was a difference in the circumstances of their appointment due to the extent, the degree of their involvement in crime, their activism and their intent. Nam served from March 2013 to May 2014, Lee Byeong-gi from July 2014 to February 2015, and Lee Byung-ho from March 2015 to June 2005. Among them, Nam is said to have begun paying special expenses to Cheong Wa Dae. He gave for Special Programs at the request of Cheong Wa Dae in a warrant and the Park, while acknowledging the fact that there is no president needs known to have. Former chairman Lee Byeong-gi reportedly raised the special purchase fee from 50 million won to 100 million won. The prosecution, he is president and chief of NIS job to the nature of money paid as tax is based on fact and believes that it would be enough. Lee Byeong-gi also confessed that he gave special money to Choi Kyung-hwan, then deputy prime minister for economic affairs and minister of planning and finance, of the liberal party. Regarding this, judge Kwon Soon-ho, who conducted a search for the warrant the previous day, issued an arrest warrant, saying, We have good reason to suspect a crime, and fear of destroying evidence of its importance. This is interpreted as an act of accepting a substantial part of the prosecution's argument that it defines the case as a bribery case. Meanwhile, former chairman Lee Byung-ho, whose arrest warrant was rejected, avoided arrest while handing over more than 2 billion won to Cheong Wa Dae during his term of office. Lee Byung-ho, former head of the NIS, said, "" I was informed of the practice since the time of Lee Byeong-gi, former chairman of the NIS, and only maintained it.

"More than 800 refugees are staying at the Pohang Indoor Stadium on July 16. If there is a screen like this (Pohang = Yonhap News Agency), it is a paper partition installed in a temporary shelter by a Japanese architect, Ban Ki-moon, right after the 2011 earthquake in Japan. "" Japanese-Japan Newsparter : 2017.1117 Above all, I hope you can make sure you get enough sleep. "" Lee Bong-yeop, 65, who met Pohang quake victims at the Hongchae Gymnasium in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, said yesterday. Lee spent time chatting with his friends over two or three stories with a paper box on the floor and a blanket around him. After the 5.4 earthquake on July 15 in Pohang, 1,421 people who lost their homes were left in 11 places. It has a combined 800 gym, 300 students from Daedo Middle School, 100 students from Hangdo Elementary School, 69 students from Haengdo Church, 35 children from wild flowers village, and 21 employees from Eumsandong Office. Many of the people who stayed at their relatives or acquaintances ' houses or visited their children's houses in Daegu, Busan, or other cities. Especially, the gym where the most victims were gathered was busy with the combination of the victims, volunteers, and government officials. Children looked at smartphones and slept while adults sat or lay awake absent-mindedly. Because there isn't much that can be done. At 1:17 a.m., when the 2.1 magnitude earthquake hit a spot 6 kilometers north of Pohang City, the gymnasium in the area of the house was rocked slightly. There was a time when a frightened person shouted at the same time while sleeping. It is unavoidable for the victims to suffer from group life after they immediately took out simple clothing from home. However, some say that partitions should be installed to ensure privacy and stability. Some shelter for the victims of the 2011 earthquake in East Japan had a paper and cloth screen installed to give a good response. Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi-do could protect some privacy by setting up tents in January 2015 in shelters for the victims of fire at Uijeongbu Apartment. However, the tent is dark, so the bad part is that you need to turn on the lights individually. Another victim (64) who met at the gym also said, "" It is best to go home because you are sick and anxious, "" adding, If you can not go to sleep properly due to the safety diagnosis, I hope you can. They do not solve rice or snack by being helped by various groups. But rice is also needed for the victims of collective living. Thin styrofoam and paper boxes are cold as they can not properly stop the chill from rising from the floor at night. In many cases, they can not wash properly and therefore stay dirty. I completely give up washing, explains Kim Ok-soon, 65, who explained that even the sounds of an earthquake make my heart feel heavy and hard to digest. As a result, they are saying that they need to provide necessities such as soap, towels, underwear, and socks, repair the disabled bathroom, and sterilize themselves inside their homes. Although we are still disturbed by the quake, children go home because they feel uncomfortable living in shelters, Rossarier said. Dae-sung apartments are closed to the public because of the danger of collapse, but some residents still live in the same apartment building. Due to the inconveniences caused by group life, more people are leaving shelters. The Rosarie family left the Heung-Heat Indoor Stadium and went to their home, Daeseong Apartment. Although we are still disturbed by the quake, children are going home because they feel uncomfortable living in shelters, Rosarie said. One 60-something resident said, I would like to go to Pohang in Songna-myeon, Buk-gu, Busan, after my niece told me to stay there to manage her pension.

"Government, convenience store late night and business hours ' curfew "" Review "". Although the department store owners initially decided to extend the late-night business limit of giving up their business to 7 a.m. to 8 a.m., the actual market is more open because of the fact that the backlash from the sale was raised earlier than usual. However, the sales of the era of convenience store owners is also high. According to industry sources on July 17, the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) is considering setting the late-night slot for a convenience store from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. Currently, the business hours for the late-night snack store are from 1:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Brokers can reduce their hours if they see a loss of business during the six-month window. The Fair Trade Commission passed a revision bill on the "" Member Business Business Practices Act "" that increases the late-night business hours from midnight to 7 a.m. or at 1:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and reduces the loss of business to three months. The company has extended its late night business hours from the previous five to seven hours, and reduced the standard of operating loss to three months. At the time, the FTC was unfair because of the time it took to close the door after closing or to prepare for the opening, even though the actual closure time was less than five hours, and it should have to wait for its shareholders to clearly anticipate an operating loss of six months However, he strongly protested that if the business hours at night increased from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m., customers would give up their business during the most hours. Reducing the number of operations to the peak of the floating population would be tantamount to giving up morning business. As with the revision, the FTC avoided the 7 p.m. curfew, which was used to set an alternative time limit for late hours at 7 p.m., The problem is that the store's sales are at one of the highest times from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. A convenience store official said, Sales are good in the downtown area because many customers look for drinks after drinking, and even residential areas have to close their supermarkets. If the time-top time limit is included in the late-night hours, it could have the effect of forcing late night sales for the free-flowers. If sales are good, it will make it harder to prove the loss of business. "" We implemented this legislation to ease the labor burden of shop owners with minimum wage hikes, but it is not the standard that makes it more difficult to reduce the number of store operations, "" an industry official said. "" It is the standard that makes it difficult to cut down on business hours unconditionally on the administrative costs by seven hours. "" Some also point out that consumers ' convenience was never considered. As the last name suggests, convenience stores are open 24 hours a day, and closing at night will cause great inconvenience to consumers. This could lead to a decline in sales for convenience store owners. If consumers are reminded that they close their doors late at night, they will go to other stores instead of the stores. Rosson, the second-biggest Japanese convenience store company, introduced an 18-hour business contract for slave sales but ended up losing sales, making the system useless. It is not clear how to move the late-night business hours from 11 p.m., a commission official said. Jiyeonjin Correspondent gyj@asiae.co.krPark Cho-rong, a reporter for the Seoul Metropolitan Government, has decided to change the direction of escalators in which more than 90 percent of the people in Seoul subway stations are going up. Although it is a myth that walking up stairs is harder than going down, it is also believed that people with knee problems, pregnant women, and the elderly have difficulty walking down the stairs. The Seoul Metropolitan Government announced on July 17 that it would try to change some of the escalators in its subway exits to the down grade by applying Universal Design, which considers diverse users. Universal design means creating an environment that is convenient and safe for anyone, regardless of age, gender, or physical condition. Most escalators installed in Seoul Subway Line No. 1 through 9 are installed in both up and down. However, when only one elevator is installed because of the narrow exit, the rate of ascending is overwhelmingly high. Of a total of 156 one-way escalators, 141 (90.4 %) operate upward. Seoul City decided to change an elevator to a down grade if two subway station exits are on the same sidewalk. For example, Exit 1 and 2 of Woojangsan Station on Line No. 5 are on the same line with the same coverage, with the escalator facing up. Change the direction of the escalator to the down direction and place an information sign for an upward escalator user on the exit. Seoul City decided to change the direction of escalators by selecting a pilot station in Jeungsan and Mangwon stations on Line No. 6, Suraksan stations on Line 7 and Woojangsan stations on Line 7. After listening to the opinions of citizens who have used the system, they decide whether to expand. chopark@yna.co.kr. A mid-low frequency earthquake is one that causes more damage to a building than a high-frequency wave. In the case of the epicenter (the closest surface to the epicenter) of the quake, the sediments in Pohang were amplified and damaged. The Pohang earthquake, which occurred at 2:29 p.m. on July 15, was one quarter of the total amount of energy generated by the earthquake (5.8 p.m.), according to the magnitude of 5.4. But Pohang citizens felt that the earthquake was larger than the one in Gyeongju. The Korea Geological Resources Research Institute announced yesterday its analysis on the cause of the Pohang earthquake, saying, "" It is because the shaking frequency range is lower than the mid-low. "" A mid-low frequency earthquake is one that has a relatively long propagation of vibrations. For example, an earthquake with a frequency of 10 Hz (Hz) will transmit its vibrations every 0.1 seconds. A lower frequency 5 Hz earthquake carries its vibrations every 0.2 seconds. Generally, the lower the frequency, the more severely damaging the skyscraper is, the more the first floor is shown to be a vibration of 10 Hz and the second to be a vibration of 5 Hz. Pohang earthquake caused a low - to mid-low frequency because the area was made of soft, semi-substantial sediments that were created during the Cenozoic Era. In case of Gyeongju earthquake, shaking was once like breaking hard crackers because of hard igneous rocks, but in Pohang earthquake, minor shocks occurred in succession like friable cookies. The damages to the nation's most populous city was due to the geographic characteristics of the town. Heunghae-eup is a village that is located between 10 and 20 meters deep in sediment, unlike the nearby area. The sediment amplified the quake's vibrations causing more damage. An analysis of the Pohang earthquake and aftershocks also revealed that there is a new active fault in the area that has not been known. Since it was not directly exposed to the earth's surface, its existence has not been known. This fault is a fault that moves both horizontally and vertically and simultaneously and is analyzed as a reverse layered main movement fault. Yangsan fault, an active fault known to cause earthquakes in the southeastern region, is a moving fault moving horizontally. If you look at the patterns in Pohang, the western ground of the epicenter of the quake, as shown by the east-rising pattern, said Sun Chang-kook, head of the Korea Institute of Geology and Geology. Up until now, aftershocks are also more likely to generate more energy at one time than race earthquakes.Oh Ga-hee, a reporter at Donga Science solea@donga.comIT media business insider introduced a video of the successful backdumbling of a walking robot "" Atlas Shrugged, "" by robot developer Boston Dynamics on Monday.In the video, the Atlas robot passes the barrier lightly and succeeds perfectly in backing up.

A sample of traveling pigeons from the Museum of Nature and Sciences in Denver, USA. Bailey libraries and archives. In 1914, a 29-year-old travel pigeon named Martha died at the American Cincinnati zoo. The species that boasted of North America, perhaps the world's largest population of 3 to 5 billion, disappeared from Earth. PetoskI, Michigan, the United States alone, vanished after only 36 years of catching 3 million in a year. However, even though it has been over 100 years since it went extinct, the debate over what caused it continues. Knowing why the dove, an icon of extinction, has disappeared is vital for the conservation of species. Painting of the traveling pigeons hunting in northern Louisiana, USA. Smith Bennett, Wikipedia Minister of Media Commons. The magnificent new year, lordliner ducks that visit our country is in the evening. But the traveling pigeons were 10,000 times more than him. John Audubon, an American ornithologist and artist, left behind a vivid observer in the 1838 book, ' The Birds of America. ' `` I saw many times, but I could tell if this was true every time I saw it, '' he said. `` When the dove soared, the sky was getting dark as a solar eclipse and the thundering noise was falling on my ears. The fecal matter dropped like sleet. He revealed that a group of traveling pigeons had even gone overhead for three days, squirming around in the sky like a giant snake. When the waste was dropped to the ankles, the branches were broken from here and there. He wrote, "" It was a magnificent, wonderful, almost terrifying sight. "" Traveling pigeon cancer specimen Brian Boyle, the Royal Ontario Museum, how did the history of overfishing get the last bird gone in a generation? No wonder, then, that people did to this bird. The bird, which travels in the eastern United States to find a forest full of chestnut berries and oak acorns, was hunted in every way and in bed. At one shoot, several were dropped. The dragonflies swept away the choked pigeons with sulfur. The uncollected pigeon gave the pig the brush-off. They set up nets to catch 800 live at a time, and then cut down nests to catch tasty young pigeons. Still, there were many traveling pigeons. Audubon said, "" I think this brutal mass murder will end soon, but it has shown that birds have increased. "" But things changed in the 1860s. Once the telegraph was invented, the journey and bed information of the traveling pigeons was quickly known, and as the railways were expanded, commercial mass transportation and sales were possible. New York City passed a law in 1907 to ban pigeons from being used as a living target for shooting ranges, but by then the bird had already begun in effect becoming extinct. An illustration of the July 2, 1881 illustration of how to catch up to 800 travel pigeons in a trap, described the ' Picture News of Frank Leslie ', who used it as a living target for a shooting range. Many of the excrements, hypothetical travel pigeons, were just too obvious examples of human destruction of a species. But there is a riddle. How did they die out so quickly, even when their populations decreased and their commercial value decreased? If hunting alone could not make them go extinct so quickly, other factors had to be found. There were even rumors that they migrated to South America to wipe out the disease. British biologist Haliday told a paper he was interested in in 1980 to find the causes of extinction in the biological characteristics of the species of passenger pigeons. He argued that the bird must maintain a minimum mass size to succeed in breeding, which collapsed and became extinct due to poor breeding. Taiwanese researchers, armed with the latest molecular genetics, conducted a genome analysis and published the results of their work to support Haliday in the Journal of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), in an interview of the travel pigeon extinction of 100. There weren't that many passenger pigeons in the past, but the disturbance of the car, which had proliferated and then declined again until the mid-nineteenth century, dealt an irreparable blow. The extremely low genetic diversity of traveling pigeons was once attributed to the group's very small movements. A sample of traveling pigeons from the Denver Natural and Scientific Museum in the United States. Deliver Bailey libraries and archives. The hypothesis that excessive choice of animals is responsible for the instability in the pigeon population itself has faced a new challenge recently. In a cover paper published in the journal Science on July 17, scientists claimed that natural selection worked so efficiently with traveling pigeons, that it led to their extinction. In general, large species are known to be highly diverse in their genetics and are not known to die out. Chang Yi-kwon, professor of ecology at Ewha University, said, "" If a large number of people live in a wide area, they adapt well to changes in their habitat. "" But they did not necessarily say that populations are diverse. A traveling pigeon with the theory that it has become extinct because it has become so well adapted to live in a huge group. Researchers at the University of California, Santer Cruz, and others say genetic analysis has shown that traveling pigeons have maintained a gigantic population for the past 20,000 years. The lack of diversity in the field, although a large group, scientists attributed the spread of beneficial mutations in the mobile carrier pigeons and the elimination of harmful mutations to occur very quickly. In other words, they optimized their behaviors to live on a large scale, and could not adapt to new environments due to overfishing. "" Even though the populations are large and stable, they are at risk of becoming extinct in the face of dramatic environmental changes, "" the researchers said in their paper. Joh Hong-seop, journalist, Hong-seop, could you be my best friend in the Hankyoreh? [Subscription to Man and Animals] [KakaoTalk] [北 Hambles-Newspaper : Uncontrolled and RedistributionDistribution Report] There were some cases in which we sent notice of past protests or requested military officials to protest against North Korea`s violation of the armistice agreement, a military official told reporters on July 17. We called a meeting between generals to explain, protest and apologize to North Korea for investigating the violation of the armistice agreement at the meeting, he added. However, the General-level military talks between the U.N. Command and North Korea's armed forces have not been held in more than eight years since March 2009. The UNC suggested holding high-level military talks with the North to discuss the incident, even after the Cheonan was attacked in March 2010, but North Korea refused. The UNC and North Korean forces are also disconnected from the DMZ and can not send out notice of protest to the North Korean military. North Korea unilaterally shut down its communication channel at Panmunjeom in February last year in protest against the government's move to close the complex. The UNC sent telephone fingerprints to the North just after the North's shelling of the DMZ in August 2015, but this time, it is known to have to make a loudspeaker even when protesting against the North Korean army. North Korea did not recognize the armistice as a norm, either, by unilaterally declaring it would cancel the armistice immediately after its third nuclear test in February 2013. However, the South Korean military said, "" If the North Korean military violates the armistice, it should thoroughly investigate the truth, if not the actual effect, and call for the South to avoid a recurrence. "" We will keep a record of the North Korean military violation of the armistice agreement on each occasion, military officials said. The UNC is also investigating whether the North Korean military violated the armistice agreement, collecting evidence from the Joint Security Area where the incident took place. The UNC reportedly secured some shots, shells and shells from about 40 artillery and pistol shots fired by four soldiers who were chasing North Korean defectors in the southern part of the MDL. Evidence that North Korean soldiers fired shots south of the MDL has been found. The U.S. is also analyzing the circumstances of a North Korean military strike team crossing the MDL. A video clip of a closed circuit TV set by the UNC showed a group chasing a fugitive to the MDL before turning around as if they had crossed the MDL. However, it is known that it is difficult to question whether the MDL is on the moon because there is no MDL marking on the approach of the North Korean military pursuit team. The conference room buildings in the JSA clearly show MDL with the cement jaw marked, but the rest of the area is on the MDL line with only the posts spaced out and no lines drawn between them. The UNC reportedly decided to publish the CCTV footage of the North Korean defectors and their pursuit group's actions when it announced the results of its final investigation. The UNC initially planned to release the video on July 16, but postponed the video, citing the need for an internal review. ljglory@yna.co.kr"

School facilities and general housing were especially affected by the earthquake. They point out that the anti-seismic design was not properly made, and there are also suspicions of faulty construction. According to the Central Disaster Prevention and Countermeasures Headquarters on July 17, the preliminary results of the earthquake indicate that the number of people who lost their lives to public facilities, including schools and cultural assets, and 63 people who lost their lives to public facilities were injured were also injured. Pohang, the epicenter of the quake, suffered 1,133 cases of damage to individual facilities. Among them, most of them were damaged by housing with 1,900 cases. Some pillars and walls of Daeseong Apartment in Heunghae-eup, Buk-gu's 6-dozen town, collapsed and were evacuated from the apartment building. As a dense forest broke out on the mountain, seven nearby residents moved to temporary residential areas. Residents are fully blocked from 16 areas in the affected area, including Daedong Villa, Hwangyeobira, Crystal Studio, Handong Mansion and Daeseong Apartment. There were big and small cracks in the floor, such as Youngilman harbor and quay, and some of them even sat down. There were also cracks at 104 schools in Pohang, including the entrance examination center for the CSAT.

"Bekal Mahmoud left home at the age of 16. This is because the father did not want to marry his husband. In 1995, when Bekal was in his early teens, the Kurds moved from Iraq to Britain to avoid Saddam Hussein. Many relatives came along and lived in a large family. The Mahmoud was the revered people in his hometown. There was a land and a prestigious ancestor. In Britain, however, Bekal's father, Mahmoud, lived on the social security system and could not speak a word of English. He was taken into custody by his brother, ArI Mahmoud, as head of the family. There were also reasons why he couldn't get a foothold financially, but most of all, his daughters had dropped him. Mahmoud's daughters did not obey his orders. After the Mahmoud got the status of refugees, his father's violence began when his daughters went to school, learned English, and made friends with ' The West. ' Violence was common. Minor acts, such as loose buttons on a coat or hair gel, also caused violence. When her father caught Bekal taking off her scarf to cover her hair, she was beaten. After spitting in her daughter's face, the father shouted, "" Don't even think about breaking your parents ' words. "" The father regarded his daughters as deaf to his orders when they came upon the Western lifestyle. This soon felt disgraceful about him. The only son became a bully who committed many minor crimes, but it didn't matter to the father. © Mail Online GalmurI Bekal goes around hiding from his relatives.When Bekal refuses to marry his cousin in Iraq, whom he has never seen before, his parents lock her up. She managed to get out, reported it to the police, and was put in foster care. The father threatened to kill all his sisters, and his mother, and commit suicide unless Bekal returned. Vekal said he had no choice but to live because the disgrace he received was too great. She believed that her father's threats would not stop with words. To Mahmoud, his own honor was more important than his family's. Violence and the pressure of marriage continued when she returned home. Bekal ran away again and went back to the foster home. When Bekal had a boyfriend, her brother came to kill Bekal according to orders from her father and uncle. He smashed the knife's head with a dumbbell in a backpack. When he collapsed with bleeding hair, he cried out to Bekal, "" It is my duty to kill my sister who is ashamed of my family. "" He could not bring himself to kill his sister. Bekal went to the hospital and sewed up the wounds, but did not respond to the police investigation. When she left home, she was also devoted to her family's honor. P.s.

My father was very pleased to hear that he was the same son-in-law as David Beckham. The man, who had just come from Iraq to Britain, spoke no English and was violent. He regularly hit and raped his wife. The parents agreed with her husband's explanation, "" To change their habits, "" and persuaded Barnaze to become a better wife. The little bride ran away from her husband after two and a half years. When Banaz returned home, he fell in love with a man named Ramat Gelemani. Rami has known each other for a long time, but she was not the right person for father and uncle's eyes. Barnaze was also legally married. Banaz and Ramet met secretly in order to avoid their relatives. They knew full well that their meeting was a problem. The relative who saw them kissing in the subway station told Dad. There was a family meeting at her uncle Arie's house. The men of the family decided to destroy the qualities of Banaz and Ramat that had demeaned the family. Arie telephoned Barnaze's mother to advise of the decision. On December 31, 2005, Mahmoud tried to strangle his daughter. Banaz broke the window and ran away. Police who received Barnaze's report did not fully understand the situation. It was hard to believe this would happen in England in the 2000s. Banaz Mahmoud (left) was found in his bag, murdered by his family.Mahmoud apologized to Banaz with tears. The father begged his daughter to come home, saying it would never happen again. Banaz trusted his father and went home. On January 22, 2006, Ramat narrowly escaped being kidnapped. Barnaze did not appear at the police station the day he was supposed to make a relevant statement. When the police, who was notified of the taste, inquired of Banaz, the family said they were getting along well with their friend because she was an adult and had the freedom to go as she wanted. She reappeared after four months, saying it was happening in Britain in the 2000s. He was nearly rotten and jammed into a suitcase. She wore only one underwear and had an electric cord around her neck. He was only twenty. She was killed by her father, her uncle and three relatives. He was tortured and raped for two hours. One of the criminals boasted to the other relatives how manly they had treated her. Barnaze was terrified and vomited, but paid no attention to it and tied an electric wire around his neck. ■ Mail Online Galmury's father Mahmoud Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is being escorted to court, where dozens of relatives indirectly participated in the case. Someone lied and provided an alibi, and someone helped dispose of the body. No one but Bekar and Rahmath appeared as witnesses. The same was true of mothers and other sisters. All the criminals involved in the murder were sentenced to life in jail. At the time of the sentence, the judge deplored the barbarity of the incident and rebuked those who value honor above the lives of their kin. But I don't really agree with you that what they're trying to protect is ' honor. ' They were only trying to save their pride by giving women at their disposal. By using violence. I was afraid of being laughed at by other men because he was not good enough. After testimony at trial, Ramath's lover and Banaz's sister Bekal changed identities and hid in police witness protection programs. Bekal wore a traditional costume, which prevents his relatives from seeing him when he went out. He was the price of liberty. Ramat killed himself in 2016, 10 years after his lover was killed.

"As accumulated since 2008, each of the sequential customers will have to pay 120,000 won per year since the end of the 10-year validity permission…The first time that the amount of unlimited use is returned to the same amount of time, the airline should pay 200 billion won per flight ticket sold out. Local airlines such as Korean Air Co. and Asiana Airlines have changed their 2008 terms, saying the mileage accumulated since 2008 has a 10 year validity period. As a result, the mileage accumulated in 2008 will not be available until the end of next year, when January 1, 2019. The 2009 mileage will expire on 2020 and 2010 Miles on January 1, 2021, respectively.◇ Air mileage validity ends next year and the total mileage reserve amounts to 1.5 trillion won for Korean Air, including 1.9127 trillion won and Asiana Airlines 547.6 billion won, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. As overseas travel has become more commonplace, there are at least 20 million people who own air miles, saving an average of 120,000 won per airline customer."" If an airline customer uses Miles, then he or she first uses those Miles that were initially accumulated from 2008 to ensure that the Miles that was initially accumulated has been fully consulted and then becomes available before the expiration date for 2008, "" an airline official said. Airline companies are also reportedly sending text messages that say the time is approaching when Miles will expire.However, there are already fears that accumulated Miles will not be fully utilized when desired, and that among them, considerable of the 250 billion won per year will die out. Airline customers want to use Miles to purchase ' bonus tickets ' or ' seat upgrades, ' but the more popular flights, the more likely they are to have frequent seat availability during the holiday season. "" Only when you book economy seats at relatively high prices can you upgrade to business seats, "" an airline official said.◇ Need to make air tickets payable with Miles available, ’’ the ministry plans to seek ways to enable airline customers to use the miles before they disappear, such as expanding the number of places they use. A plan to allow people to pay for air tickets in full or in part with mileage, such as Korail and KTX Miles, is being considered.However, the government is not likely to come up with a plan because it does not know how many miles each airline has per year or how many airline members have Miles to spare. We have pushed for revisions in related laws in 2015 to encourage airlines to report their mileage information to the government, an official at the ministry said, encouraging airlines to expand their use of the miles they currently have. In response, airlines say it is not easy to expand the mileage points as it takes a series of procedures, including obtaining financial commission`s approval under the Electronic Finance Act.[everywhere@chosun.com][ the press hongjungi the dot com a shortcut] - copyrights © 5 Kits combine the Chosun Ilbo and chosun com 【 = Newsis, Seoul, Korea and Hong Hyo Shik, reserved.The - Journalist : Ahn Cheol-soo.Uidang-myeon KM21 2017.11.15. yesphoto@newsis.com 【 = Newsis, Seoul, Korea and Lim Jong Myung Kim Nan Young Uidang-myeon Journalist : The Ahn Cheol-soo, the Lee Myung-bak on Monday the Moon Jae-in, former president to the government's.Full payment of an evil of data is that the Roh Moo-hyun government corruption and political belief that the regulations for ""I can't cover it up with's behavior."", pointed out.

"Professor Lee Kook-jong of the United States Forces in South Korea (1992-1992) moved out of the hospital for one year with 35 % of the younger nurses leaving hospital, and a surgery department said Monday that no one was involved in tracking the issue. To prevent bedsores from forming on the back. The patient is heavily equipped with a respirator, artificial kidneys and fluid reservoir, blood clots, and various life-signal monitoring facilities. Professor Lee Guk-jong interviewed JoongAng Ilbo after the second operation on July 15 by a North Korean soldier who defected from the South. [NEEDS :] Jang : The other patient has similar equipment. Lee Guk-jong, head of the Korea Center for Oriental Medicine, said, Because of the high blood loss, patients with severe injuries can use artificial kidneys and other devices. I can`t open my eyes. Night night care is for nurses. When I asked the nurse who was injecting medication into the fluid bag, she gave me a hand. Because I'm too busy. `` You can not wake up when you hear an emergency beep simultaneously from a device attached by patients, '' another nurse said. The Azudae Center opened in June last year. In one month, he or she has enough patients to fill in 100 beds, leaving 30 to 40 people hospitalized in other hospitals. Sixteen others besides Aju University were designated as trauma centers, which opened nine sites. Some operate partially. The company invested 257.7 billion won from 2012 to 2016. The preventable death rate (the proportion of those who survived proper treatment) decreased from 35.2 % in 2010 to 30.5 % in 2015 (the trauma center 21.4 %). It is still higher than the 10-20 % of the U.S. and Japan. Lee said, "" I still had a lot of complaints. Regional trauma center surgery Q : What needs to be corrected first?A : "" We are short of nurses. A minimum of one-to-one care shall be provided. As one person has to see several patients at the same time, it is not possible to create more than one room. 35 % of nurses have been transferred from work in the past year. "" Q : What about doctors?A : "" I don't have any surgeons. There's only one emergency medical specialist. "" The Azu University Center hasn't had a surgeon in two years. According to the Korean Hospital Association, the ratio of support for surgeons dropped to 90.1 percent this year. The same goes for nurses. Son Hyun-sook, head of the Center for University of Azu said, The patient here is very serious and can not predict his condition. Have a lot of psychological stress It feels like doing twice the work of another ward. Sohn added, Foreign countries have a separate staff that is responsible for lung, injury, nutrition and medicines. Lee Guk-jong, head of the Center, points to problems with the evacuation system. `` Doctor helicopters do not fly at night. Except for the Gyeonggi Fire Department, fire helicopters do not work well at night, said U.S. first aid workers, who are known to be older than us by flying a 1992 helicopter by night. Doctor helicopters (6) pay annual wage of 3 to 4 billion won from the Ministry of Welfare. Some trauma centers don`t actively regard patients, said Kim Yoon-yoon, a medical professor at Seoul National University. The patient is flocking to Azu University Hospital, where the government has spent a lot of money but the trauma center is not working effectively. Professor Kim said, If the 119 emergency department has a serious case, it is problematic to get them to an emergency room nearby. You should go to the trauma center even if it takes time. That is how we get professional treatment. Professor of trauma at Gacheon-gil Hospital in the strongest country also said, We saw a 10 percent decrease in deaths over the past three years. We can accommodate more trauma patients, but 119 goes to an emergency room in a nearby hospital, said, If you go to the emergency center, an emergency medical practitioner checks you and calls you and takes the time to do this. Serious trauma patients may die within the hour. The medical bills are low, and the government should finance the labor costs of support personnel, Choi said. Cho Hyun-min, head of the district trauma center at Busan National University Hospital, said, We need to create a price for nurses at the trauma center.

Cave lions are known to have become extinct about 10,000 years ago as carnivores who lived on the Eurasian continent during the same time as mammoths and Rufous-like tigers. Few fossils have been discovered so far, so it is hard to say how specific they look like. A cave lion cub discovered frozen in the air made its announcement at a news conference in Tokyo on July 15. The Russian Academy of Sciences and the medical team at ChikaikaI University in Tokyo, Japan. An additional one was discovered in September after two years of being found in the ice of frozen waters in the Zakha Republic of Russia in 2015. The research team said one of them, with a length of 40cm and a weight of 3kg, has hair remaining on his face and is well preserved to the point that he appears asleep. The other one was 47.5 cm long and weighed 4.6 kg. After a thorough examination of the physical characteristics of the cave lion found, the researchers estimated that it was born less than a month ago, with its fur increased than that of modern lions and its birth to more than 50,000 years ago. One of the two dogs discovered two years ago is said to have all of their body bones, organs and muscles intact. `` It's a big discovery, '' said Dr. Alberto Protefort of the Sakha University Academy of Sciences at a news conference. `` It's amazing.

The iPhone X Reservation Selling (Seoul = Yonhap News), reporter Kim Joo-hyung (Yonhap News Agency), has begun selling the iPhone X in Korea. Officials at a large telecom company in Seoul describe the "" iPhone X "" on July 17. ▽ Selling 20,000 units of kjhpress@yna.co.krKT sold in five minutes = A photo of the combined news bureau of the initial iPhone 8 (Seoul=Confederence News) was sold out with Apple's ambitious iPhone X (10) scheduled for July 17. It is analyzed that the highest price of more than 1,550,000 won (256 GB) is causing the initial volume to fall short of the demand. SK Telecom sold out of its reserve requirement for the first time after three minutes of online booking at 9:00 a.m., and the second sale, which started at 9:30 a.m., sold out in just 1:50 a.m. Compared to the first 20 minutes of iPhone 7 sold out in the first and one hour last year, the second generation sold out at a noticeably faster rate. The iPhone 8, released three weeks ago, had a substantial amount of content left. This is because the reservation for iPhone X was not enough. SK Telecom reported that less than half of the iPhone 8's first reserve is for the iPhone's first generation. More than 20,000 KT were booked in five minutes, and LG's reservation for the first 10 minutes was more than doubled for the iPhone 8. It is hard to keep up with demand because the initial supply is so insufficient, an industry source said. The three companies still receive requests to sell their iPhones X reservations, but the order to open them can be moved back. The first batch of iPhone X in Korea is known to be 100,000 units. It is far from enough compared with the iPhone 8 series of more than 200,000. As additional supply plans are uncertain, a potential disruption in the supply volume is expected. The iPhone X is equipped with the first face recognition function called "" Face ID, "" which utilizes an OLED screen and a 3D scan. The high price of the products is 1,367,000 won for the 64GB model and 1,557,600 won for the 256GB model. Public support is estimated to cost 34,000-122,000 won, with most buyers willing to take a 25 percent discount, or five times as much discount, as the aid.

"A woman who lives in Ull-la bought a building with a 4 billion won cigar to reduce her gift tax by handing down 2 billion won to her children. The tax office only charged two billion won for the building. After receiving the loan for two billion won, he paid no gift tax on his children by giving them debt two years later. If the fund gave 4 billion won in cash, it should have paid a gift tax of 620 million won, but it avoided taxes with a kind of money donation. Recently, small, five-story buildings that are used as neighborhood shopping malls or offices in urban areas are being used to avoid taxes by the wealthy. Unlike apartments, they have little transactions and can not judge the price of apartments, so they have to resort to setting standard market prices that are not nearly equal to the market price. As a result, some point out that the standard of assessment for real estate properties should be properly raised first, rather than raising property taxes, as opposed to raising property taxes. The related authorities, including the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport and the National Tax Service, identified the problem and started preparing countermeasures.○ Non-residential property located on the fifth floor in the downtown area of the tiny building that has become a means to avoid taxes, is called Little Building because it is small in size. Investors noticed that the six-story building near Yangjae Station in Seocho-gu, Seoul, which was purchased by broadcaster A for 2.8 billion won in 2000, recently went up more than 20 billion won. The problem is that they are being used to avoid inheritance and gift tax for the wealthy. For residential real estate, such as apartments and apartments, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Housing, the best prices are announced each year. The National Tax Service and local governments will levy capital gains tax, inheritance and gift tax on each child by combining publicly assessed value and market price. On the other hand, non-residential properties do not have much of a transaction volume and their prices vary significantly depending on their location, making it difficult to accurately price them. Without an open disclosure system, the National Tax Service and local governments will publish standard building towns. In other words, there is no consistent standard of assessment. As the price increases, the gap between the market price and publicly announced price will grow, and taxes will likely be decreased. A building near Rodeo Street in southern Seoul has a standard market price of only 10.52 billion won. If the building owners give their children gifts without a debt, they will have to pay 8.85 billion won in gift tax when applied, but only 4.2 billion to the standard market price. In addition, tax will be reduced further if parents give their children the same debt they have secured on their property.○ If the government introduces the system, it will increase taxes by more than 60 %. Therefore, the argument is growing that the difference between the sale price of non-residential buildings and the standard market price should be reduced to ensure proper taxation. Politicians should also establish a standard for the assessment of real estate tax, which is excessively underestimated before raising property holding taxes. NTS Commissioner Han Seung-hee also stressed during this year`s parliamentary audit that I really think a formula to increase the market reflection rate is necessary, as some lawmakers point out that the stores and buildings should remain low on the floor. According to a report by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport and the Korea Institute of Public Finance in September last year, when the non-residential real estate price disclosure system is in effect, the combined real estate, including residential and commercial properties will grow 68.8 percent. Tax payers ' standard market will also be raised by more than 60 percent from the current level. The report said that retail outlets will grow by about 67.5 percent from the current standard market price of the Ministry of Public Administration and Security and offices by about 63.8 percent. As a preliminary step, the National Tax Service completed a revision to a law that would hand over to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport the project to calculate the standard price of non-residential property. The ministry is preparing specific calculation standards for the introduction of the real estate price disclosure system. The ministry is set on a major framework to disclose the price of non-residential property, said Park Byung-seok, director of the ministry`s real estate evaluation division, to finalize its technical preparations for implementing the system by the first half of next year.Choi Hye-ryeong, reporter of the Supreme Public Prosecutors ' Office, Park Jae-myeong, and Cheon Ho-seong, official news agency, Facebook. Prosecutors secured evidence of the slush funds of Hyosung management, including Chairman Cho Hyun-jun (49), and began a search for the slush funds. The Seoul Central District Public Prosecutors ' Office's investigation team 2 (senior prosecutor Kim Yang-su) said Monday, "" We raided the headquarters of Hyosung Group in Mapo-gu, four related companies, and four residential areas for working-level employees. "" Prosecutors have launched an investigation into whether Hyosung mobilizing its affiliates to create slush funds. Such suspicions were raised in 2014 when the second son, Cho Hyun-moon, 48, accused the elder brother of being the chairman. Former Vice President Cho said, "" At that time, 10 billion won of embezzlement or breach of trust was caused by Hyosung management, including Chairman Cho, making excessive investment in affiliates. "" Former Vice President Cho has been in the prosecution several times as an accuser, but has been staying abroad recently, including Singapore. The case was initially allocated to the investigation department, which is in charge of the accusations and accusations against the company, and then assigned to chapter 4 of the investigation into major corruption cases, including corporate corruption cases in 2015. Questions arose over whether the influence of Woo Byung-woo, then senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, was played by Cho's lawyer.

"▽ Industry Department of Commerce and Industry = Export by $ 501.2 billion as of 2:00 p.m. on July 17 = Korea achieved annual export volume of $ 500 billion in the shortest time ever. The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy and the Korea Customs Service announced yesterday that the aggregate annual exports surpassed $ 501.2 billion.It is the shortest period since the trade statistics were compiled in 1956, and the figure has surpassed the $ 500 billion mark. Currently, the preliminary tally shows that the volume of exports is 501.2 billion dollars and imports is 416.6 billion dollars, which makes it more likely to reach 1 trillion dollars in trade this year. Trade volume decreased by year after 2014 by $ 1.982 trillion, reaching $ 963.3 billion in 2015 and $ 906.6 billion in 2016. Main causes of the gap in annual export volume in the shortest period exceeded $ 500 billion were a steady growth rate by item and region, and increased diversification of items and regions. By item, most of the major items were promoted, such as exports of semiconductors, petrochemicals and steel, among the 13 major items. In particular, semiconductors are leading the export growth, breaking their all-time export record every month. The cumulative standard of the third quarter showed that semiconductors accounted for 16.1 percent of the exports. In addition to the 13 major products, diversification of items has progressed, including the steady growth of promising consumer goods and exports of the eight new industries. By region, exports to most major regions, including China, ASEAN, and India, have shown steady growth. The cumulative standard of the third quarter, ASEAN recorded the largest export growth at 30.6 percent, followed by the European Union with 22.8 percent, China (13.4 percent) and the United States (5.3 percent). sypark@newsis.com> Domestic Seismic Research Step-Level Geological Resources Research : Unreported seismic intensity in Gangwon Province Chuncheon : Yonhap news agency is now squirming with the "" active fault. "" Although up to 450 potential active-producing structures including Yangsan fault, which is blamed for the strong earthquake in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, are still known to have settled down in Korea last September, studies have shown. A map of the nation's active fault lines is not expected until 2041.The Korea Institute of Geological Resources said in a briefing on July 16, "" After investigating the surface of the main earthquake, Pohang Earthquake struck on July 15 along a single layer in the north-south-north direction that had never been reported as being. "" Another fault that caused the previously unknown quake was discovered in the southeastern region of Seoul, the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) estimated that the quake was felt in a different neighborhood from the previous day's one in Jangsan, a tributary of Yangsan's fault. The Korea Institute of Geological Resources, along with the Korea Meteorological Administration and academia, began an on-site investigation to determine the cause of the Pohang earthquake. About 450 active fault lines are now estimated to exist south of the Korean Peninsula. The Pohang earthquake also suggests that there may be much more active faults. Earthquakes are mostly caused by ' fault, ' which is layered. In particular, active fault lines are more likely to have an earthquake or fly as tectonic movement is in progress. Kim Young-seok, professor of earth's environmental science department at Busan National University of Seoul, said, "" Ninety percent of earthquakes occur in an active fault. "" Although there are hundreds of active fault lines, only 25 were found to have been investigated by the government. Choi Seong-ja, a researcher at the Korea Institute of Geology and Earthquake Risk Map Creation and Publishing project, commissioned by the National Institute of Geology and Resources Development in 2009, said, "" The Seoul Metropolitan area, Chungchong Province, and Jeonnam are estimated to be active. However, the project report was not released when experts raised the reliability issue due to the hasty implementation, so virtually no reliable data on the active fault exists. Under these circumstances, there were no agreed standards to define the active-fault fault, so academic circles debated over the existence of an active-single-action Korean Peninsula. The national research was carried out in earnest this year after the Gyeongju earthquake last year when the Active-Story Group began receiving attention. The government is pushing for a fault-to-fault investigation from this year to 2041. During the delay of the investigation, the active layers on the Korean Peninsula began to act more suspiciously. Experts agreed that Pohang earthquake was caused by the "" active fault "" itself, and said, "" Now an earthquake of the magnitude of 5.0 on the Korean Peninsula can be found at any time. "" In particular, the Yeongnam region, where Gyeongju and Pohang are located, is known to have many active faults that could cause earthquakes, including the Yangsan fault, Milyang, Moryang, Dongrae, Ilgwang and Ulsan. If aftershocks of the Pohang earthquake occur in nearby areas, it could provoke other cracks and cause larger earthquakes. If the ground between Pohang and Ulsan shakes, the Ulsan fault could move too, said Kim, referring to the large reverse formation of the Ulsan fault, although its length is shorter than the mass production fault. The metropolitan area or central region is not safe from an active fault. Choi Seong-ja, researcher of the institute, said, "" Hongseong Fault and Jeonju Fault, which penetrates Hongseong, Chungnam Province, where the magnitude of the earthquake hit in 1978, are also active ones, and they reach the southern part of Gyeonggi-do. "" As a result, the Seoul earthquake hit the city in 1518. However, he pointed out that the government should push for the investigation from a long-term point of view, as it is possible to have to scrap the "" second safety report "" should occur after it is busy with immediate results. Lee Ki-hwa, honorary professor at Seoul National University, who first raised the possibility of an active fault in Yangsan since 1983, said, As large-scale earthquakes originate from large single layer areas, we should conduct a thorough investigation.

"Shin Young-chan, a reporter at Todal Girls ' Middle School, is accusing Lee Young-hak of being a child's father and an epileptic. Hwang Jae-ha, a reporter at Yonhap News Agency in Seoul, said, "" Lee Young-hak, 35, admitted not that he violated and murdered his daughter's junior high school student during her first trial. "" He also claimed to have been high on hallucinogens at the time of the crime and was weak in mind and body. Lee Young-hak made the statement during his first hearing in Seoul's Constitutional Court hearing on July 17, which was held at the Supreme Court with a criminal consensus on the case of Chief Justice Lee Seong-ho. In addition, he expressed the same opinion in a recent statement he made to the court. The court referred to the opinion of Lee Young-hak. Lee said in a statement, ' I think I committed this act because I miss my wife. Miss A wrote, ' I and my wife thought it was the nicest of friends. ' I would like to ask the victim to forgive me, Lee Young-hak said in a statement. I will live by the sweat of my teeth. Don't just sentence a life sentence. I want to live a life with hope. ' In addition, Lee wrote in a statement, I would like to offer sacrifices to my wife for my daughter.

"" Lee lowered his head and whispered, "" Somehow … "" "" Lee Young-hak committed the crime while his mind and soul were weak from hallucinations and delusions, and the murder was incidental, "" the lawyer said. It is interpreted as an attempt to be given the benefit of the doubt by claiming that he was unable to make a clear judgment. Lee Young-hak was adopted as a witness for his daughter (14-year old) and herself when a 36-year-old man accused of helping him escape from prison denied the charges. When the judge asked, "" Why so Woo? "" Lee sobbed, "" I don't want to see the child here. "" The witness newspaper for the young girl will be held on July 8. Park insisted, "" It is true that I gave Lee Young-hak a lift to my car, but I did not find any hiding places to stay and I did not know that he was on the run after murder.

"" Leonardo preferred the twisted movement, "" he said, "" but at best it was called a good studio with a bit of Leonardo at best, and it's not very damaged. "" In a separate column in New York City on the same day, Jaisson Pragnov also raised doubts about the authenticity of the work. As for Salvator Moondi, he noted, It is not a particularly brilliant religious painting from northern Lombardi during the 16th century, although it is a feat by Leonardo. He said, "" Muslim touch was inserted, "" citing the suit of Jesus in a zigzag line, adding, "" If you analyze Leonardo's work technically, it is a pure blue light. "" He had a ' spiral competence ' with Christ's flowing hair down to the neck, but the recently restored ' portrait of St. John of the Barriers ' was not Leonardo's ' portrait of St. John of the Baists '. Salvator MundI is known to have been painted by Leonardo in the 1500s for the French royal family and moved to the British Royal Family when Franco-General Henrietta Maria married King Charles I of England in 1625. The painting, which belonged to King Charles I, first appeared at an auction in 1763 and was then lost until Sir Frederick Cook, a British collector of paintings, bought it in 1900. Meanwhile, as the face and hair of Jesus were covered, it was not recognized as da Vinci himself but rather as the work of his students. That is why they were sold at Sotheby's auction in 1958 for only about 45 pounds. It was also sold as a fake painting in 2005. However, he received an authentic assessment from experts at the 2011 London National Gallery exhibition. Martin Camp, an honorary professor of art history at Oxford University in Britain who was involved in the emotion at the time, said, "" Nobody drew anything like that, not even da Vinci's students or followers, and it was a newly discovered painting by Leonardo.
