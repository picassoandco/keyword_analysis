"Lee Hae-young, a mysterious carnivores who died out about 10,000 years ago, was found in the frozen layer of Russian permafrost. The baby cave lion, found frozen, was born about 50,000 years ago. Cave lions are known to have become extinct about 10,000 years ago as carnivores who lived on the Eurasian continent during the same time as mammoths and Rufous-like tigers. Few fossils have been discovered so far, so it is hard to say how specific they look like. A cave lion cub discovered frozen in the air made its announcement at a news conference in Tokyo on July 15. The Russian Academy of Sciences and the medical team at ChikaikaI University in Tokyo, Japan. An additional one was discovered in September after two years of being found in the ice of frozen waters in the Zakha Republic of Russia in 2015. The research team said one of them, with a length of 40cm and a weight of 3kg, has hair remaining on his face and is well preserved to the point that he appears asleep. The other one was 47.5 cm long and weighed 4.6 kg. After a thorough examination of the physical characteristics of the cave lion found, the researchers estimated that it was born less than a month ago, with its fur increased than that of modern lions and its birth to more than 50,000 years ago. One of the two dogs discovered two years ago is said to have all of their body bones, organs and muscles intact. `` It's a big discovery, '' said Dr. Alberto Protefort of the Sakha University Academy of Sciences at a news conference. `` It's amazing. '' "" I will continue to study the cave lions, and how they lived in what environment, "" said Shikokai Naokai University, Tokyo medical school professor, who was a member of the team. lhy5018@yna.co.kr and inquiry (Click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (Click!)

The government is subsidizing farmers to support the baby boomers and give a boost to their farming and fishing villages, but a substantial amount of the subsidy is being used illegally. The government's joint corrupt prevention team announced on July 16 that 505 cases involving the diversion of loans to farmers and receiving improper subsidies were confirmed and 17.1 billion won. It is a result of the government's joint inspection of projects to support home farming and home village projects for eight local governments with typical rural communities between April and July. It is the first time that the government has checked the status of ears in the wake of the Act on the Promotion and Support of Earbards and Earthlings in 2015. The government has provided support to the people who live in rural areas since 2009 by conducting ‘ Home Farm and Home Village Project ’. It supports the fund at a low interest rate of 2 % a year, ranging from 300 million won per family starting to 75 million won per house. In addition, the center is operating a stay-style agricultural startup support center, in which urban residents can experience agriculture while staying in rural areas. The total support amount rose to 31.50 billion won this year from 51.3 billion won in 2011. The study found that 15 billion won out of the total amount of 103.8 billion won in loans violated the law in the loan business. The ratio is 14.4 percent. The subsidy project was poorly executed at 2.1 billion won, 11.7 percent of the total amount of subsidy of 178 billion won. In addition to his case, a former government employee falsely registered as a temporary home in a rural area, and then took out a loan for home farming or received a settlement subsidy for home farming. In some cases, they reported to rural villages and took out loans from businesses, but according to the inspection, the land they reported was an inhabitable place. The government will request for investigation, collect aid, and discipline officials involved. The government decided to strengthen management to prevent such cases from recurring in the future. A tentatively named "" fund information system for businesses with rural communities "" was adopted to systematically manage the lending process and prevent double payment of funds to people with the same date. It is required to register the completion results of rural education with the education system in order to prevent cases in which those who did not receive education for farming or farming should be cheated out of receiving funds for businesses that did not return to Korea. The fund information will be shared by the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, Korea Forest Cooperative Federation, and the government will avoid redundant assistance. To find out if he is working in other industries, he or she will receive additional receipts from the source of income when applying for a home run. "" We will conduct a supply and demand survey by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and metropolitan governments for all municipal and provincial governments, "" a government official said.

Seven residents in the lower part of the area evacuated to homes of relatives or community centers at 9:45 p.m. The Korea Forest Service is planning to dispatch an investigation team of researchers, professors and doctors to investigate the causes of the landslide to determine the damage and prepare countermeasures. Investigators will visually explore site index cracks and damage scenarios and discuss future actions, such as extent of damage, time to stabilize the land forests, and the return of refugees.

"ROK-Canada currency swap conclusion (PG) [Choi Ja-yoon] Illustration[The biggest meaning since Korea-U.S. currency swap] The establishment of the Korean economy trust, financial cooperation and importance of the market (Seoul = Yonhap news) Choi Yoon-jung, a financial crisis reporter said yesterday The Bank of Korea and the Central Bank of Canada signed a currency swap deal with the Korean won on July 16. A currency swap is a contract that allows you to make an emergency call to your own country and borrow money from your partner or dollar. When it comes to households, it is like a negative account. The currency swap agreement with Canada is significant in that the subject is actually the key currency. Currently, no one in the other side of the currency swap agreement has been able to negotiate with Korea. Canada is an advanced country that received the highest credit rating of AAA (Moody`s) from the three major credit rating agencies in the world : Standard & Poor`s (S&P), Fitch (Fitch) and Moody`s (Aaa). The central bank says the Canadian dollar is recognized as the most important currency in the global financial market, along with the U.S. dollar, the eurozone euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound, and the Swiss dollar. Though the currency swap with China has significant meaning in many ways, such as economic cooperation, it is not sufficient to take measures in case of a crisis because the yuan is not the key currency. The Bank of Korea Governor Lee Joo-yeol said in a telephone interview with Yonhap News Agency, It is the most meaningful currency swap deal with the United States during the 2008 financial crisis. Since financial stability is stipulated for the purpose of the currency swap agreement, a strong safety valve has been set in case of financial instability, Lee said. Deputy Prime Minister and Strategy and Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon spoke at the Government Office of the Republic of Korea and Canada on Tuesday morning. "" It is significant that we have a strong foreign exchange safety net that can be utilized in the event of a crisis, "" Deputy Prime Minister and Strategy and Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said at kimsdoo@yna.co.kr on November 16, 2001. The term "" standing agreement "" is exceptional. It is the first time that South Korea has signed a bilateral currency swap with an indefinite amount of aid to each other. It is a standard agreement in the form of currency swaps among the six major key players. It can be interpreted as Canada recognizing Korea as its equal partner in terms of economic and financial market stability. Korea will be able to enjoy the effects of the currency swap network indirectly. There is no need to worry about tools at maturity. Korea is currently entering into a $ 168 billion (U.S. dollar basis) currency swap agreement with China, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia via the regional financial safety net, the Chiang Mai Initiative. If the UAE (United Arab Emirates), which is under extended discussion, includes $ 5.4 billion, the bilateral agreement will be extended to five countries and $ 122.2 billion in size. Lee Jeong-hoon (Yonhap News Agency), a reporter of the Korea Won - Canada dollar exchange program, checks the Canadian dollar yesterday morning at the Modulation Response Center above KEB Hana Bank's headquarters in Seoul. The Bank of Korea and the Central Bank of Canada signed a currency swap deal with the Korean won for the U.S. dollar on Monday. The agreement with the United States on currency swap of $ 30 billion helped pass through the financial crisis, but has now ended. Japan and the currency swap were suspended due to diplomatic conflicts.ROK-Canada Signs a Unlimited and Unmatured Currency swaps (Seoul = Yonhap News) Korean Bank President Lee Ju-yeol (left) signed on July 15 at the Bank of Canada's Ottawa, Canada, where he and Canadian Central Bank's Stephen Polos. photo@yna.co.kr Korea extended the maturity of currency swaps with Australia and doubled the size of its currency this year, and subsequently signed an extension contract. In addition, they have made efforts to suggest to the Bank of Canada that they make a currency swap agreement. The central bank said it has been in talks with the Canadian Central Bank for several months and that negotiations have been in a steep slump since the middle of last month. Although the risks of North Korea have been eased a little, the currency swap agreement has been concluded with the North on the higher alert. Lee Chang-sun, an economist at LG Economic Research Institute, said, "" It is especially meaningful that Canada has secured the U.S. dollar's credibility, stability and liquidity during an emergency, and that it has not helped to strengthen the Korean credibility and thus increase its maturity.

Report the news on the news and inquiry (click!) ▶ Use of Starbucks coffee on subscription to Yonhap News Channel - horn is restricted by road traffic laws … Be careful about how to use the horn system … Using the horn car as an increase in noise, and use of the horn equipment. Unless the honking area or dangerous zone designated by traffic signs is specified, honking is strictly restricted by road traffic laws. But the reality is that less than a few seconds after the signals were changed, many drivers use it to blow their horns and press their car into a space to rush to the front or make a right. This leads to noise complaints and causes retaliation. One intersection in Seongdong-gu, Seoul, is noisy with honking horns all day long. Vehicles that make right turns often use the habit of honking. The four-lane shuttle route is narrow, the signals are long and there is a diagonal crossing, so the right-handed cars have to wait for at most several minutes. Feeling frustrated, drivers are honking their horns on the straight ahead to ask for a move. However, the two lanes are not reserved for turning right, but for going straight and turning right. Most drivers try to avoid using the stop line in order to cry out. In modern society, where driving is the norm, road manners not only guarantees each other's feelings but also my safety. Police are cracking down on selfish driving and driving in downtown Seoul. Lee Jeong-ok (58, female), who runs a restaurant near the intersection, said, "" I get nervous because my horn rings all the time.The same is true of the inconvenience to nearby residents who often use the road. Danny, 26, sounded like a loud horn for decades when everyone knew the road was too narrow to make it easy for the car ahead to turn right. The signal has been changed, but the car in front of him still blows the horn because it is slow to leave. "" I started driving, and I couldn't understand it for a while, "" said a 32-year-old office worker, "" but I couldn't understand it until I was startled by a horn at an intersection five or five times. "" When the car in front of you looks a little immature or confused, honking horns can also make the car feel uncomfortable. A 34-year-old office worker hit the horn more than 30 seconds after a car got lost on the road while driving along an eastern highway. Kim said, "" I apologize to you when I turned on the emergency lights, "" but the horn on the rear car did not stop. Choi said, "" If I press the horn in the back for decades, I get nervous and drive harder. "" A 29-year-old office worker who recently bought a car and drives to work is the example of honking his horn as a defensive driving style. I have had a minor fender-bender recently while transferring to my car, Kim said, saying, Since then, I have been in the habit of honking whenever I see a car coming in from the lane without a blink. "" I know I should refrain from honking around schools, but there are certain aspects to defensive driving, "" he said. Drivers ' horns come from the streets in heavy traffic, which also causes annoyance to nearby citizens. The honking sounds of bullet buses that conquered lanes at the entrance to the Gyeongbu Expressway south of Hannam Bridge and complained about the use of the special lanes are very stressful for nearby residents. [Photo : Jung Hee-jo Correspondent /checho@heraldcorp.com] If there is an urgent reason to avoid dangerous situations under the Road Traffic Act, a horn can be used. However, it is also susceptible to being interpreted as a reckless driving if misused.Park Moo-hyuk, professor at the Korea Highway Traffic Corp., said, "" In general horns can be used for justifiable reasons, such as emergencies, but if there is no clear reason, horns can be broken, and the cars can be punished for directly by the traffic stopbars. "" In other words, it is not necessary to push forward for a car that is about to turn right in the lane that enables you to go straight and turn right. In such cases, they often lead to actual punishment. As the number of reports has recently increased to include a tip line from "" Searching for Witnesses, "" the number of people who are punished for violating traffic signals is on the rise. Police launched a retaliation and violent driving crackdown from February to December last year, which resulted in 12,611 cases in which 20.2 percent of those who were caught were "" threatened with honking or elevated "" cases were found to be their second largest threat. why37@heraldcorp.com"
"Rep. Won Yoo-chul of the ruling Grand National Party received a photo on possible involvement in questioning by prosecutors and aides over the possible involvement of prosecutors in the probe into the scandal. Prosecutors who have been investigating the surroundings of Won, including his aides and businessmen in local districts, are now focusing on Won. According to the authorities, on September 15, the Seoul Southern District Public Prosecutors ' Office arrested the office of Won Gyeong-won, a district office in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province. The search and seizure reportedly includes Rep. Won's house, which has been in charge of financial accounting, such as political funds and donations.Prosecutors suspect Won received about 100 million won in illicit political funds from businessmen based in his district. The prosecutors will also check whether illegal political funds are in return for what they say is because they include funds that look like bribes. Prosecutors plan to summon Won after they finish their analysis of data obtained through a search and seizure, sources of funds, personalities, and statements of officials. If Won helped solve various business complaints, including approvals, and received illicit funds in return, criminal punishment will be inevitable.In particular, it is noteworthy that the seizure and search targets include the office of the district in Won. Former aide of Won and businessman of acquaintance are on the investigation so far, but Won himself has confirmed that he has been designated as the subject of investigation by prosecutors. This means the prosecution has obtained substantial evidence and statements concerning the handling of the National Assembly's judiciary.Prosecutors told a former aide of Won's aide Kwon (age, age 55) and his aide Han (age 47) last September to prosecutors in search of the bank's accounts. In particular, while analyzing the flow of funds from nearby figures, including Won's aides, they have been tracing and finding clues that led to a number of random amounts of money being flowed into them. Kwon was previously convicted of accepting 30 million won in jail time in October 2012 from Park, the head of a plant equipment company W, for arranging loans from an industrial bank and receiving a jail sentence in June. The Financial Investigation Department of the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors ' Office, which was in charge of the investigation at the time, investigated whether Won received bribes, but concluded that Kwon was involved in corruption.Regarding this, Won has flatly denied any of the allegations, saying, We have done nothing to cause any legal problems.

Pablo Picasso's previous record price was "" The Algiers "", which was sold at Christie's in May 2015 for $ 179.4 million (approximately 988.2 billion won). Only 10 movies have ever sold more than $ 100 million. In a non-public auction, the personal transaction record was at the top price of $ 300 million, set in September 2015 by Dutch abstract expressionist Willem de Kooning, an American artist. Da Vinci's rare painting of Jesus Salvator Moondi [Yonhap news agency] released around 1500 years ago, Salvator Moondi raised his right hand and blessed him with a crystal. It was the only painting by a person that had less than 20 paintings left. The remaining works of da Vinci, including the famous Mona Lisa, are currently housed in museums in France and the Louvre. Although we are now in a position to receive the highest ransom, the process has not been smooth. The painting was damaged by severe painting by the hands of European nobles and went on for hundreds of years without even knowing whose work it was made by. The painting, which was bought by British collector Sir Frederick Cook in 1900, was sold at a Sotheby auction in 1958 for only ￡ 45 (approximately $ 70,000). It was not known that da Vinci was the student of this painting. Experts, however, confirmed that the painting was genuine based on an accurate assessment of brush strokes and dyes in 2005. He was first displayed at the London National Gallery in the U.K. in 2011 and entered the hands of Rivolobleff in 2013. At the time, he paid $ 127.5 million (approximately 140 billion won) to Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier. The work was finished before the auction in Hong Kong, San Francisco, London, and New York, and was popular with a steady stream of visitors. "" Some critics have questioned it, but they agree most of the scholars were from Da Vinci, "" Christie said. The identity of the buyer of the overpriced item is unknown.

Existing Top Biofunding Radio-Presser, Picasso [EPA = Combined News] Nomad @a.cok. ▶ Report on possible solar radiation and inquiries ("" Click on it "") ▶ Open up in the latest solar trend : Scientists believe that the planet may have conditions that allow liquid water and life to exist. The journal "" Granoble Institute of Astrophysics and Astrophysics "" published on Tuesday by the New York Times and CNN. They reportedly identified the red dwarf star ' Ross 128 ' and its orbit around the solar system with a high-resolution radio planet tracking device (HARPS) at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Rasia, Chile. The planet is nearly the same size as Earth, with a mass estimated to be at least 1.35 times that of Earth. However, the researchers added that the mass of the Earth could be doubled. The distance between Ross 128 and the planet is 4.5 million miles (approximately 72.4 million kilometers), nearly 20 times that between the Earth and the Sun, which is 930,000 miles (approximately 146 million kilometers) apart. The distance between Mercury and the Sun, which is the most inward part of the solar system, is 36 million miles (about 59.3 million kilometers), a far cry from this. Therefore, the planet has only 9.9 days of revolution. Still, astronomers expect the distance to be suitable for life given that red dwarf planets are much darker and cooler than the Sun. That means it should be close enough for exoplanes to absorb enough warmth for the presence of liquid water, one of the essential conditions for life to exist. The radiation dose delivered to the planet by the star Ross-128 is estimated to be 1.38 times that of the radiation that Earth absorbs from the Sun. In particular, the Ross-12 128 is more reliable than most other extraterrestrial planets, such as the trappists and the Proxima b, that scientists have discovered earlier in life. Proxima b, called ' the closest extraterrestrial planet ' only 4.2 light years from the solar system, was exposed to the much more deadly ultraviolet rays and X-rays emitted by the stars ' Proxima Centauri, ' while Los Angeles ' deadly radiation was much quieter. Since radiation from red dwarf planets can remove oxygen from the atmosphere of nearby planets, the less, the more likely it is for life to exist. As Bompis, the lead author of the study said, "" Such (radiation) releases can disinfect the atmosphere of a planet. But Ross 128 is one of the quieter stars in our neighborhood. William Dancey, an astronomer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, also told Los 12 b that although there is a "" wait "" and "" it is possible that life could live, "" it is very possible and it is unclear "" Also, both Ross 128 and Ross 121b are moving toward Earth, so it can become the closest extraterrestrial planet in the solar system in 79,000 years, beating Proxima b. But other astronomer Vladimir Irapethian at the Goddard Space Flight Center said, "" It's a quiet star, but it could have destroyed the Ross-128 ultra-electronic emission X-rays by more than 10 times. "" Astronomers expect to observe Ros.12 128 directly and see if oxygen is present in the atmosphere with the next generation of large-scale terrestrial telescopes with mirror diameters of more than 30m. firstcircle@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"

[Report : Korea (news1.kr), [Untraded and redistributed] [The Hangyeons Country 2, OECD Top survey found that the most desirable rest is to rest alone, to relax in the forest, and to take a rest continuously. Rest in nature brings peace of mind and body. The rest of the day is spent on taking time off, and finding peace of mind and body. The Korean dictionary says, ' Stop what you are doing and stop. ' Stop what you're doing. Yes. You must stop what you are doing to relax. The problem is that you can not stop even if you want to. According to a recent survey commissioned by the Korea Institute of Industrial Economics and Trade (KIS), 33.5 percent of vacation time was less than five days per year, or 1000 workers aged 20-59 years old. The most frequent cause of the poor vacation was the "" atmosphere at work "" of 44.8 percent. The survey was followed by "" excessive work "" and "" insufficient substitute workers. "" The reality of the day is that office workers can't stop their work even though they want to take a break from work. What kind of country is Korea? The annual working hours are 2113 hours, the second highest among 35 OECD countries as of 2017. It is a far cry from Germany's 1,171 hours of least working hours per year. So, in reality, they are too busy to do what they call an "" annual work hours "" or an "" international ranking. "" Still, I need to take a rest. Let's stop the work for a moment and get into a dilemma about how to stop. What kind of situations do Korean office workers want to take off and how do they want to take a rest? An ESC survey was conducted. Ask 1000 men and women aged 20-49 with the survey platform Tylion (www.tillionpanel.com) on November 10, the results showed that ' when you are sick ' (40.4 %) and ' when you need to relax ' (36.4 %). The number of "" when there is too much work "" (23.2 percent) was relatively low. It appears that the desire to rest is stronger than the workload, when the body and mind are uncomfortable. The most desirable relaxation options were ' staying at home ' (58.4 %), ' Travel ' (20.5 %), ' Conversation with Friends ' (8.1 %) and ' Light exercise ' (8.1 %). If given a break, it simply means that they have a strong desire to do nothing and relax. Women (65.6 percent) were stronger than men (51.2 percent). When asked what kind of rest would you choose if you were given a day off, the most (38 percent) surveyed showed a desire to sleep all day long (43.2 percent), which is also higher for women (32.8 percent) than for men. Next, it was "" Oncheon Bathing "" (20.6 percent), "" Walking a dense forest path, "" (15.8 percent), and "" Light exercise "" (13.3 percent). Although the ratio of "" what is most necessary for relaxation "" to "" economic composure "" (47.0 %) to "" time margins "" (44.7 %) was not much different, however, by age groups. In the 20s, 52.3 % answered "" free time "" and 40.4 % answered "" free time "" while 51.0 % answered "" need "". In other words, people in their 20s and 40s feel they are short of time. The most frequently asked men and women who they would like to be with when given a day off, and the other answers were, "" Alone (37.6 percent of men and 48.0 percent a year). "" The answers of ' Family ' (27.4 %) and ' Lovers (16.9 %) ' (16.9 %) were relatively small, with the majority of those who wanted to rest unhindered.

"· The rate of real estate asset price hikes and the rate of increase in labor income can be much higher than that of wealth inequality. The lifelong workplace concept has vanished, and it is hard to afford a high rent for the ' sweat '. Ultimately, the exit individuals found was the most apparent ' real estate '. In reality, when I woke up, the land price of apartments and apartments had gone up. Although investment sentiment seemed to be rather shaken after two crises before the 2008 global financial crisis, the myth of Korean society's invincible property market is now becoming a faith. Is the era of hard work, saving money, and becoming rich over?Learning effects on property prices are strong. Lim Joo-eun (48, alias), who ran a restaurant in Seocho-dong, Seoul, closed down his store in 2014 and became a rental business. Lim saw the real estate possibilities as a means to rebuild the country in 1998 after the IMF crisis. "" The apartment building in Gangnam went down to 4 million won per pyeong (3.3 ㎡), but went up to 27 million won in just two or three years, "" Lim said, "" I thought, ' Oh my goodness. ' Currently, it has an eight-story hotel in BangI-dong, a commercial building in the same East Asia Alley and three commercial buildings in Seocho-dong. He said, Since the IMF has been falling since, if you put one billion won in a bank, you still get 10 million won in interest, and who would put the money in the bank now?The government has come up with a tougher set of 8-2 property policies to drastically reduce mortgage loans, but the faltering market is stretching again. According to the National Housing Price Trends (Housing Price Survey) released by the Korea Institute of Audit and Inspection, housing prices nationwide rose 0.13 percent from the previous month. In particular, housing prices in Seoul increased from 0.07 percent in September to 0.23 percent in October. The price of apartments in the Gangnam area and the inner circle, which are preferred by residents of the Seoul Metropolitan area, increased after September.The real problem is usually the velocity of rising real estate assets passed by far more than the increase in labor income, undermining the will to work between parents and their children. Song In-ho, an economist at the Korea Development Institute, said, The learning effects on real estate prices were strong and the result was a failure to find an investment destination amid a long term low interest rate stance and low growth rate. Thomas PikettI, author of the book, on inequality in wealth, pointed out that as asset returns rise above economic growth, income inequality is also growing. Korea, whose assets are almost real estate oriented, is a country that best demonstrates Piketty's sense of problem.The 2016 balance sheet by the Bank of Korea and the National Statistical Office showed that the price growth rate of unproductive assets last year was 4.6 percent, the highest since last year`s just before the financial crisis, when it hit 13.2 percent. Unproductive assets consist of land assets, underground resources, and timber with a share of land assets of 99.3 percent. The increase in wages was only 1.0 percent. Je Yoon-kyung, a fisherman's representative, said, "" The capital to income analyzed based on the concept of income and wealth defined by the BOK statistics and PikettI, is 8.28 times larger than that of wealth. "" Local households, non-profitable groups and government holdings were combined to total about 911 trillion won in 2016, according to Piketty. The ratio of GNI to GNI was 8.28 trillion won in net income from the nation (NNI) excluding depreciation of capital. The higher the scale, the less the labor they bring. The figure rose 2.3 percent over the past 20 years from 5.98 before the foreign exchange crisis. The current figure is more than twice that of the United States (4.10) and Germany (4.12), and higher than when the real estate bubble in Japan and Spain peaked. Japan doubled to 6.99 in 1990 and Spain doubled to 8.19 in 2007.The high rate is especially related to the excessive price of real estate such as land in Korea. The aggregate value of housing market increased by 22.2 percent to 3732 trillion won last year from 3053 trillion won in 2012, and the land price of residential buildings also rose to 248.5 trillion won from 1943 trillion won in the same period.

"The pilotis structure is a type of architecture that is open to the public on the first floor without any walls. As the parking standards of apartments in Korea were drastically tightened from 1997 to 2002, parking spaces were actively secured using the pilotis structure. Currently, most of the apartments and motels on the first floor are designed with shopping facilities or parking lots and are located on the upper floor.The pilotis structure is very vulnerable to earthquakes because the lower floors that support the entire building are weak. Seoul Metropolitan Government introduces the pilotis structure as an earthquake resistant building through its Building Seismic Inspection website. The first floor has a column, but on the upper and lower floors, buildings with only walls are very vulnerable to earthquakes. Also, many stairwells are not located in the center of the building, which is very vulnerable to earthquakes because of the strain concentrated on the columns on the other side of the building.The magnitude 5.4 earthquake that occurred in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, on July 15 revealed the dangers of the pilotis structure. Shortly after the earthquake, the skeletal picture was spread in social media and online communities, with the first floor parking lot with the theme of the Pohang studio apartment complex, Pilotic Building Earthquake Damage, and others. Some dangerous buildings were also seen bent with the car park posts that could not withstand the load.The revision in 2015 required buildings with three stories or higher or 500 ㎡ or higher to be earthquake-proof. As of December 2015, however, only 6.8 percent of the buildings were equipped with anti-seismic designs. Public structures had only 40.9 percent of earthquakes and private structures only 30.3 percent. The ministry, therefore, has implemented a revision to the building code that would expand the anti-seismic design target to two-story or 200- ㎡ or more.The problem is that although the scope of seismic design is extended, it is not applied retrospectively to previously built structures. The government has promoted anti-seismic reinforcement such as incentives such as building failure rates and floor space rates when reinforcing existing buildings. However, although the structure is designed to be earthquake-proof, the public anxiety is growing as it raises the risk of an earthquake.Choi Min-soo, senior researcher at the Construction and Economy Research Institute in Seoul, said, "" In case of Japan, we need to strengthen the anti-seismic performance of existing structures by providing financial support and providing financial support to support for existing structures. "" It is not easy to find an earthquake shelter nearby in a scary situation where the building is roaring and shaking in the near future. Most of the time, they run out of a building or an apartment and gather around to watch the situation. The same applies to Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, where a 5.4 strong earthquake hit. Pohang City has 415 outdoor earthquake shelters, including a school playground and vacant lot, across 29 towns, sides, and East Side. Starting from April this year, all signs of evacuation center to town and on the east coast were installed. Last year's Gyeongju earthquake triggered an earthquake, creating the nation's first earthquake map to be used to avoid earthquakes. Web maps are available at a glance to determine the location of each neighborhood through the city's website and the home page of the disaster relief headquarters. It is also available on PC and mobile. Various information on shelter, how to act during an earthquake, contact information from the associated agencies, and earthquake accidents is available.However, few citizens used shelter when a strong earthquake hit on July 15. They didn't even know there was one, or they couldn't afford to run to one. Most of the residents gathered in small groups on the streets, not in shelters, to relieve their anxiety. "" It was so urgent that I felt as if I had to go out and move to a safe place, "" said citizen Lee (47), adding, "" I just didn't think it would be a good idea to go to evacuation center. "" We can`t tell whether or not the citizens went out because the shelter was a playground or an open space, said a Pohang City official, who planned to evacuate for the sake of public safety since we can`t be safe from earthquakes. shlim@yna.co.kr ▶ Report and inquiry (click!) ▶ All the latest trends were set (click!).

The first - to third-grade class at Chung-won High School in Cheongju was not able to provide students with their first day of class, and the first day of elementary - and morning class was not open until the first day of test. In some schools that decided to go to school due to postponement of the CSAT, nutritionists or chefs did not come to work and the ingredients were not available to provide lunches, and so lunch was not available. Contrary to the education office's guideline to force high school seniors to study at home, some schools were at the discretion of the school owners, causing confusion among parents and test-takers. According to the Chungbuk Provincial Office of Education on July 16, Cheongju's Unho High School was planning to close its doors on July 16 when the CSAT was held. It is because teachers were dispatched to school as a coach for the exams en masse, so it was impossible to get regular classes, but when the CSAT was postponed, the first or second graders except the third graders ' class decided to go to school. We were forced to go to school to fill the number of school days, said an official at the school. However, the decision was made late at night, so nutritionists and chefs refused to go to work and lunch classes were not delivered, so they decided to take only morning classes. The official said, As group lunch is not available today, we decided to have all of the students leave school at 12:30 p.m. after the fourth class. As instructed by the education office, Osong notified seniors not to go to school but to take psychological stability at home and notified freshmen or sophomores not to go to school. Two-thirds of all teachers were ordered to close because they were appointed to supervise the CSAT, and according to the original plan, it is difficult to provide school meals and can cause confusion to students who are supposed to be closed for the day 16. Despite such a policy, some third graders have been taking independent lessons at school. The school said, "" Since it is difficult to provide meals to school students, students who attend schools should take care of it voluntarily. "" All the first or third graders of high school at Chungbuk University closed their schools. They decided to keep their original decision because the delayed CSAT could confuse them if they reverse their plans. Fortunately, no students attended the school as of July 16. Cheongwon High School, contrary to the education office's guidelines, requires all freshmen and seniors to go to school. The classes will continue as usual, and night time self-study will take place. The school also provides group meals. The nutritionists and the chefs were also here, and they decided to prepare a menu in a hurry to provide meals, school officials said. High schools were confused by the postponement of the CSAT, but the boarding school, Chungbuk Science High School, was lucky. The school, where all students live in dormitories, does not change significantly. The school will also take care of the school's lunches as usual. ks@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"

As the CSAT was delayed without notice for the first time in 24 years ' history, it has become inevitable to reschedule the admission of all universities. The CSAT was also held on the day it was scheduled to be released in 2010 when the swine flu spread. Students who were born in 1999 were also victims of frequent changes to the curriculum. They have not learned history in social studies classes for the past six years, because the seventh and fifth graders ' curriculum to learn history was adopted when they were in the sixth grade, and in fact, the sixth grade class of 2007 was revised. In 1999, students went through more education courses than anyone else, including the 7th curriculum, the 2007 revision curriculum, the 2009 revision curriculum and the 2011 revision curriculum. jylee24@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"According to the travel industry, major airlines and hotels have yet to present plans to provide an exemption from the official cancellation fee so far, so if you cancel the test fee, you should cancel the cancellation fee of the travel packages by 30 percent. Major travel agencies decided to exempt the fees at their own expense. In addition, some foreign airlines operating in Korea will be exempt from paying fees as a branch office. "" If we receive cancellation by the 20th, we will exempt the test takers and their parents and siblings from paying the fees for the goods they leave by the 30th, "" said an official of Hana Tour. "" First, we will cancel the fees and charge at the airline. "" Even the most favorable travel packages were canceled by canceling the price of an examinee and one of her guardians who booked the merchandise by July 23 when the airline and the hotel did not have any idea of cancellation fees. Yellow balloons will be exempt by reflecting the cancellation fee of travel packages not only for examinees but also for immediate family members. The scope of exemption from cancellation fees is "" Products Leaving November 16-23, "" which must be registered as a test taker and a family certificate. Changes to a schedule can be made without a fee and the difference by date can be collected only. In addition, the commission will be exempt in the case of earthquake victims in Pohang by checking their copies.KLM Air France has decided not to accept a cancellation fee on its ticket at the request of Korean branches. "" The postponement of the CSAT due to natural disasters is a special case, and the headquarters did not have a separate guideline to deal with it, "" said an official of KLM Air France. But the test was postponed. When it is considered difficult for domestic airlines to perform such travel schedules as natural disasters, they usually cancel reservations without a fee, but they have not given a detailed opinion yet. The postponement is more incidental than directly related to natural disasters, said a Korean Air official, in a further review of the cancellation or refund.Unlike overseas trips, tickets, hotel reservations, and travel packages related to domestic travel should be cancelled on the day of an earthquake. Those who cancel the program due to possible aftershocks should pay a fee. We are 100 percent refunded if we cancel the tickets on the day of the earthquake, but there is no clear rule to provide a cancellation for direct ticket payment due to possible aftershocks, said an official at Korail. The same goes for hotels. "" It was a natural disaster that worried us to be safe, so we can cancel the cancellation fee if we ask for it on the day of an earthquake.seulbin@news1.krReport to Pohang! ! [Report on News1 Korea (news1.kr), [Unrestricted and redistributed] Government on the morning of July 16. Governments will report to Breakfix, which led to the construction of apartments in New York City, which was devastated by the earthquake.Ahn Young-kyu, director of disaster management at the Ministry of Public Administration and Security, made the statement in a briefing on the situation of the Pohang earthquake in Seoul on July 16. The following is an interview with Director General Ahn - When is the announcement of a special disaster zone?▲ In case of an earthquake, it is a natural disaster, so it has a quantitative standard. Pohang will decide whether to designate as a standard or place of request when damages amount is more than 9 billion won. ▲ area ask?= Not yet. Depends on the re-adjusting force index. - If there is a serious earthquake, is it possible to delay the CSAT again?▲ I don't assume such a situation. - Contingent aftershocks are continuing, but what about the second phase of the series? ▲ and the second? Damage is anticipated on a large scale, but not at the moment. Phase 1 is enough. It's just a rough estimate of the damage to the schools. How? Did you check to see if you are going to take the CSAT next week? Have you made any decisions at the Ministers ' meeting? ▲ School was diagnosed urgently yesterday. The ministry, education ministry and experts will make a thorough diagnosis on the part. The ministers ' meeting was a meeting to discuss various ministry progress, and to support the restoration of damages and damages in the future. - How much money can the special grant tax be paid?▲ and then, the amount is not decided yet.- Why did schools only have 23 % of anti-seismic designs? _ ▲ and then it looks like there are a lot of targets. Overall, designated public facilities were 43.7 percent as of the end of last year and schools 23 percent. First of all, there are lots of construction subjects, old schools, and it might be the effect of that.- We announced comprehensive measures to deal with the earthquake in Gyeongju on December 16, last year. However, I will make up for it actively with this earthquake.- whether there are support measures or support for the victims of human casualties or victims.▲ If you're taking emergency measures now and you have something to support in the future, there's going to be extra support.- How are the 10 inpatients, Social facilities, public facilities. All 32 fractured schools in Pohang? ▲ Ten people were hospitalized, but one of them had a serious operation and the rest was treated with minor injuries. - Are measures being discussed to strengthen the anti-seismic design issues in schools? What effect will the earthquake have on pre-relieving policies? ▲ School violence is a big investment. It was less than 100 billion won per year before last year's measures, and since then, it has utilized the Education Ministry's special bridge tax, and so forth. I'm doing it. As for the nuclear plants under construction of Sin-Gori Units, they are thought to be designed and implemented with tightened earthquake-resistant standards. It is not the time to answer the overall nuclear plant policy.- There are many poorly built first floor buildings like the PilottI building. Pictures of sidewalk columns were used to create a wall. Regarding such things, countermeasures? ▲ PilottI Building has been pointed out before. Since the damage was seen this time, I will take measures with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.- All the houses were earthquake-proof until the second half of this year. How is it going on with legislation?▲ October 27, it was signed into law. In future, anti-seismic design shall be mandatory when constructing all homes and buildings with more than 200 square meters.

In the process, the North Korean military pursuit team fired around 40 rounds of rifles and pistols, loaded with live ammunition, and sent reinforcements to our archipelago rifle, creating a threatening situation. Therefore, it is known that the Military Armistice Commission of the U.N. Command will release the closed circuit (CC) TV video set up at the JSA on July 16. Newsis reviewed the tense situation at the time. At 3:14 p.m. on July 13, three North Korean soldiers rushed to the North's outpost line on a road in front of Panmungak, North Korea. It is because an attempt to defect was made to North Korea at the risk of the lives of its soldiers. A few minutes later, a North Korean soldier drove a jeep with water wheels that fell into a ditch at 3:15 p.m. and sank on its chin 10 meters away from the border. At this time, there was a boom, and it was seen at our guard post. The North Korean soldier tried to defect several times after falling out of the race, but was shot by three North Korean soldiers running and one North Korean guard post and soon jumped out of the car, when more than 40 AKs were fired indiscriminately. The South Korean military immediately strengthened its surveillance and readiness to fight, and transmitted the situation to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and sent in reinforcements. However, it is known that no firing was carried out by the Korean military. South Korean guards were not able to cover the vehicle with the trees, and North Korean soldiers were hidden by trees and witnessed the incident temporarily. At 3:31 p.m., the first time a North Korean soldier fell down on the west side of the Freedom House was found with a thermal shock detection device (TOD) in the Panmunjeom's situation room. The North Korean soldiers were shot in five places, including their shoulders, thighs, and abdomen, and covered with fallen leaves. The place where the North Korean soldiers fell was just 50 meters from the Military Demarcation Line and 60 meters from the North's outpost. There were no wooden or forest cover, and therefore there were threats of additional fire from North Korean soldiers. 【 Seoul-Newseer : On July 13, a soldier who defected from the Joint Security Area (JSA) is transferred to the Suchu University Hospital, Suwon City, and Nambu District trauma center. The North Korean soldier was shot during the defection and was wounded in the elbows, shoulders, and so on. Colonel Kwon Young-hwan and two other Korean Army battalions commander Kwon Young-hwan led the Korean contingent, and crept in on (Photo = Subsidised by Readers).

"In the PilottI building, three of the eight pillars were damaged during the Pohang earthquake on 15th. Baek Kyung-seo, a reporter, said, "" I ran because I heard there was an earthquake at home, and I was struck by an eight-grade car accident on the 8th floor of Jangseong-dong, Pohang City, North Gyeongsang Province. The building was built in the form of a pilotis. Pilotis is a building that has a column on the first floor and can utilize empty space as a parking lot. Five police officers were barred from entering the building. "" It is just ridiculous, "" said Choi (45), a landlord who met her in front of a house. It is very sorry, but I am a victim.

I drove home because I was worried about the people who were staying in the apartment, Pohang Filoti Building has a no-go line. Luckily for the reporter, the test-takers on the third floor of the building were outside. Choi took the student to safety. Even though they have things needed for the college entrance exam, they were too dangerous to enter again. At the time of the earthquake, there was one tenant in the building. According to police, the house alone has had two reports of a rift within it, possibly collapsing. What would you have done if you had an accident? According to Choi, the building owner of the house saw media reports after the earthquake and ran quickly to install the iron pillar. Choi asked, "" Shouldn't we not destroy altogether? "" But the architect was quoted as saying only, "" We can save you. "" The builders who met on the scene hurriedly evacuated the site, saying, I have nothing to say. The Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs and Pohang City visited the building, but it is no surprise that they could not reach an exact conclusion on whether to remove the building immediately. Three officials from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport came to the building at 9:00 p.m. the previous day and told Choi, We need to do more research, so please wait for it to happen. However, Pohang officials visited the scene at 12 p.m. that day and told Choi, Since the building is privately owned, we should settle it out of court with the client.

"As the number of millionaires grew fivefold since 2000 with the assets more than $ 50 million in pockets due to quantitative easing in the 2007-2006 Credit Superlech Report, 43 percent of millionaires grew from the U.S. to the top 10 percent of global millionaires (global financial crisis) Born from 1980 to 2000, the Millenier Generation is expected to experience much greater inequality in wealth than the previous generation. Analysts say the number of super-rich capitalists in Korea will grow 7.2 percent each year over the next five years, further contributing to the poor economy. Credit Suisse (CS), the Global Investment Bank (IB), announced its "" 2017 Global Wealth Report "" on July 14 (local time). As of the end of this year, the world's wealth increased 6.4 percent to 280 trillion dollars (about 3,000 trillion won). The figure shows that the financial assets and real estate assets were debt-loss. The phenomenon of the rich becoming richer continues. In 2008, the top 1 percent of the wealthy made up 42.5 percent of the world's wealth. The ratio rose steadily to reach 50.1 percent this year. It is possible to analyze that after the global financial crisis, the quantitative easing in the U.S. and other developed countries helped make more money into the pockets of the rich. In particular, the number of super-sized asset holders with assets of more than $ 50 million (about 56 billion won) has increased fivefold since 2000. Compared to the more than $ 1 million asset price increase, it is faster than that of Korea's economy. There were about 36 million people in the world with assets of more than $ 1 million. The number of Korean students has increased by 3 million since last year. The human water supply is 0.7 percent of the total but owns 45.9 percent of the world`s assets. Among them, 5.3 million (43 percent) are in the U.S. Japan ranked second with 2.7 million (7 percent) and Britain with 2.2 million (6 percent). China ranked fifth with 1.9 million, or 5 percent. Adults around the world own an average assets of $ 56,840 (approximately 63 million won). Korea had the 10th largest millionaires in the world with 686,000 (2 percent). CS estimated that the number of millionaires in Korea will grow to 972,000 by 2022. Korea had the world's 10th largest asset with more than $ 50 million and a supercluster of 2,300. The number of students has increased by 12 percent since last year, and it is expected to reach 3300 by 2022. Korean adults ' assets averaged 166,607 dollars per person this year. The people of Millenier, now in their 20s and 30s are expected to face an accelerating inequality in wealth. CS called them the "" unlucky generation. "" The Millenier generation suffers from unemployment due to the financial crisis, intensifying income inequality, rising property prices and student debt. Pension receipts are also expected to decrease compared to previous generations. The statistics are also clear. The average asset in the United States this year is $ 72,240. This is 46 percent less than the 134,800 dollar assets that people in their 30s now have. The gap between the rich and the poor was extreme between countries and the continents. Assets per adult in North America rose 9.9 percent this year. On the other hand, Africa saw only a 0.9 percent increase, and South America saw only a 3.9 percent increase. Korea has increased by 4.4 %."" Graphics : Na Seong-won : naa@kmib.co.kr, [Kookmin Daily Web site] [Facebook] [Newspaper! (click] KoodNews Internal News Agency (www.kmib.co.kr), [Media Center conducted last year], which prevents unauthorized copying and redistribution of information. There were also concerns over the possible collapse of the rock last year when the quake hit 5.8 on the Richter scale in Gyeongju, leaving it as if it were the second largest ever. Cheomseongdae, a structure reportedly built during the reign of Queen Seondeok (reign 632-647), is 9.07 meters high and has an air mass area of 28.35 ㎡. The structure of the air mass above the geodestone, 27 steps in a cylindrical shape, and the second stage of the gander stone was raised, and the 13th and 15th stage had a small entrance to the south. Because of its elongated shape, strong vibrations are apt to break down, but Cheomseongdae is a staunch cultural asset that has kept its presence for nearly 1,400 years. It is not clear whether the Silla people were mindful of the anti-seismic designs at the time of the construction of Cheomseongdae, but in conclusion, Cheomseongdae is equipped with anti-seismic features that are also used in modern architecture. The reason why Cheomseongdae stands firm against strong earthquakes is its lower center of gravity. The lower part is larger in diameter than the upper part, and up to the 12th stage is filled with gravel and soil inside, resulting in a lower center of gravity. Experts say that low center of gravity makes the vibrations more resistant to vibration than the five to five fingers that can be pushed back into place. Kim Deok-moon, director of the National Research Institute of Cultural Properties, said on July 16, "" The theory of weight loss is not utilized for the reason that Dongfang Ming Ju, a skyscraper in Shanghai, China, is famous for its reasons. "" Kim added that the sperm cell in the 19th-20th and 25-26 levels also contributes to the seismological vibrations. In addition, the cross section of Cheomseongdae is considered to be circular, and the cross-building of stone bricks without gluing is also a reason to withstand earthquakes.Cheomseongdae Survey conducted after Gyeongju Earthquake in September last year. However, human beings can not regard Cheomseongdae as a perfect building. Back in 2014, when the Board of Audit and Inspection investigated, Cheomseongdae was 20.4 cm tilted from its central axis. In addition, since the absence of members, cracks, and discoloration appeared before the Gyeongju earthquake, the team goes through a thorough examination four times a year. After last year's Gyeongju earthquake, the central axis leans two centimeters further north, and the stone tomb stone was found to have moved a little. However, the Cultural Heritage Administration and scholars judged that although the slope has become severe, it is not enough to worry about collapse. Gyeongju is likely to have a strong earthquake with a thousand years, Kim said, adding that we plan to clearly identify the source technologies our ancestors had secured against earthquakes and utilize them to repair and restore them. psh59@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"Earthquake Damage Presentation""North Korea Earthquake Ground Damage Report Possible for a MultI-Layer Residential Building in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, one day after the quake occurred on July 16. "" This is different from the ‘ cotton fault ’ of the Gyeongju earthquake, which could be estimated roughly on the ground, so it appears a thorough investigation is needed. The Korea Institute of Geological Resources said yesterday, "" The earthquake in Pohang on the face of the main rail link is analyzed to have occurred on the reverse movement of the northern and southern directions, "" adding, "" It has never been reported before. A moving main fault is one in which two layers slide to the left or right. An earthquake appears when part of the fault extending laterally releases accumulated force on the left and right sides of the fault. Park Jeong-ho, head of the Korea Center for Geological Resources Development, also told Yonhap news agency shortly after the quake hit, As the fault slips, I believe the earthquake occurred because of movement toward home. Academia groups faults that have moved at least one time more recently into the "" active fault "" category. Yangsan fault, which runs from Gyeongju to Yangsan to Busan, is well known for its active fault.Pohang Earthquake Analysis Status (Daejeon = Yonhap News Agency) [Korea Geological Resources Research Institute] estimated that there are currently 450 active faults in South Korea as of 11 a.m. on July 16. The center of the Pohang earthquake has an umbrella plant to the west, but not directly connected to it. Because of this, it has been continuously raised that the Pohang earthquake occurred in an unknown fault. The earthquake hit about 40 kilometers northeast of last year`s Gyeongju earthquake, Jijinyeon said, adding, The earthquake-producing fault is not believed to have been reported on the Earth.Korean Marine Corps (Marine), express its assistance to the earthquake victims and its citizens (Pohang = Yonhap News Agency) : Home-sponsored soldiers are recovering from the disaster after they began to provide support to the public. Regarding the expression ' previously not reported ' in 2017.11.16, Dr. Shin In-soo of the Earthquake Research Center stated, "" If you go through a geological investigation process, you can assume that a fault is still possible. "" He added, Understand that the Pohang earthquake was operating on an previously unknown fault, which was not estimated on the surface of the city.Daeseong Apartment is seen as a big apartment building that was closed to the public because of the wreckage of the earthquake that hit the area in Pohang. The earthquake also had a short duration of strong earthquakes (1-2 seconds). It is explained that medium - to low-frequency frequency vibrations are more developed than those in Gyeongju earthquakes.Comparing the Number of Earthquakes of Pohang Earthquake and Gyeongju Earthquake Comparisons=Conference News (Daejeon = Yonhap news agency), which estimated that the first year of the Pohang earthquake was released on July 15, was aftershock (blue) and tsunami caused by last September 12. In addition, it was discovered that the earthquake in Pohang had a relatively high vibration intensity near the surface of the earthquake due to its shallow focus. We believe the quake could have caused a great deal of damage as it could have been amplified in the sediments, said Jijinyeong official in Pohang, the epicenter of the quake.

"Jeon Byung-hun, senior secretary for political affairs at Cheong Wa Dae, finally resigned yesterday. It has been six months since his appointment on May 14. Jeon is currently in jail because his aides were involved in corruption of home shopping reservers during his term as a lawmaker. Prosecutors have confirmed that they will investigate Jeon personally. Regarding the current presidential chief of staff, Jeon was forced to resign, unable to endure what he called an "" unusual "" situation in which the prosecution pointed the knife at her at the beginning of the administration.◇ Measurement “Nu has had devastating to the former secretaries of the deviant behaviour … president” I, at Chunchugwan of Cheong Wa Dae ""Today, president offered his resignation."" and "" long time, but not.For Political Affairs did my best to assist the president at the top of trying to do, and as a result, trouble to make sure that I was with great pleasure that I really feel miserable. ''Set up as "" extremely hard to put to the public`s hopes citizens and government, it's just so much with your president who can not be to put in the then presidential chief of staff job. I don`t believe you'll keep until the end of the government was Moon Jae-in people. And I feel sorry for the deceptions of my former secretaries. But I make it clear that I have not engaged in any illegal activities.After entering the center with a firm face, Jeon read the prepared position statement. He could not even speak the words in the middle. The past advisers were referred to by hand and recoiled once. After the announcement, he left the office without being questioned.◇ Preparation of a serious investigation = The prosecution has confirmed that Jeon will be summoned next week. The major suspects in the case of the commission and embezzlement of the Korea e-Sports Association are all directly and indirectly involved with Jeon. Although Jeon protested that he was "" not involved in any illegal acts, "" the prosecution has surrounded the leader by one person after another, placing a nearby figure in the dragnet. Jeon is expected to appear on the photo lines of the prosecution for the first time among high-ranking officials of the current administration.Considering the progress of investigations, it is inevitable to question Jeon, the honorary chairman of the association, said Shin Bong-soo, a senior prosecutor at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ` Office. Moon Jae-in president is key aides, former senior investigation would a day back home after finishing a tour abroad. Jeon is expected to sit in the prosecution investigating room next week as a suspect at the latest.Lotte Home Shopping Corporation provided 330 million won to the Korea e-Sports Association in July 2015, and among them, 110 million won is stolen, all of them are former senior acquaintances. The grant was led by Yoon (34, arrested), a former senior secretary. Right after deciding whether to reseat Lotte home shopping network, he called in officials of the Ministry of Future Creation and Science, the responsible ministry, in early May 2015 and raised questions over whether to re-setting the company should reconsider. At the same time, Lotte Home Shopping asked for support. The prosecution judged the money as a bribe.Yoon and his fellow secretary, Kim (arrested), and Bae (37, arrested), a former civil rights activist, who was involved in embezzlement. Bae, who runs an amusement establishment, is known to be a member of the Dubul Fishing Party. His social network service was linked to a large number of Democratic politicians and former senior regional office officials. Bae reportedly learned of Jeon through his former senior staff.An acquaintance of Bae said Bae helped him with his former senior duties many years ago. She was called "" folding screen "" during the general elections and told around the neighborhood that her daughter helped him when he was president of a university. T & S representatives who were hired to launder donated funds were also reported to be related or close to Bae. The former chairman of the Korea Youth Commission in Seoul, a regional hub, was also known to have served as the chairman of the company`s youth committee.Prosecutors believe it is unlikely that Jeon knew anything about the process of having many of her aides and acquaintances launder money and embezzling large sums of funds from associations.◇ Former Senior Director & e-Sports Association Professionalization? Jeon became the first politician to head the Korea e-Sports Association in January 2013 when she was a member of the National Assembly. Before that, businessmen had been the chairman since its inception in 1999. In the former Senior Secretary General system, Yoon is known to have exerted great influence. Although he is not a member of the association, he was known as a secretary to the president. Cho, 46, who was dispatched as an employee of a telecommunications company that signed the chairman in 2011, reportedly called Yoon a vice chairman. Cho became the former chief of staff in 2014 after taking office. Prosecutors suspect that former senior secretary has effectively established the Korea e-Sports Association through close associates such as Yoon and Cho since taking office. The reason why Jeon resigned as an honorary chairman in December 2014 as an honorary chairman as a result of a ban on the appointment of her and her successor is because she wants to continue to manage the association. In fact, Cho is known to have reported to Yoon major tasks such as the commission`s budget, personnel management, and events. Even though they knew of Yoon's withdrawal from the society, they paid a card to Yoon after the former chief of staff was optimistic about the matter last year. Yoon reportedly spent about 100 million won on entertainment and other expenses with his card. Prosecutors also believe that the members of the association were mobilized to protest the omission of nomination nominations and that the association's board changed its articles of association to pay Jeon.Taewon June 15, Seoul Correspondent wjtae@kmib.co.kr[ [Facebook] ▽ Damage to exam rooms, possible aftershocks, and disadvantages of high school applicants in Pohang are expected to be announced by the Education Ministry on July 16. Schools suffered considerable losses due to the magnitude of 5.4 on July 15 in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, and if an aftershock occurs on the day of the national college entrance exams, it is unlikely that the exam will be disrupted and lives. Fortunately, the fear that normal tests will not be easy to conduct in the earthquake-stricken Pohang area even if there are no major aftershocks on the national college entrance exam day played a crucial role. Deputy Prime Minister and Education Minister Kim Sang-gon also told a press conference on July 15, Considering the importance of student safety and the fairness of the tests, we decided to delay the CSAT by one week. The ministry initially announced that it would carry out the CSAT as soon as the earthquake hit, but with the damages identified, it changed its stance and decided to review the postponement of the CSAT. In fact, it was discovered that out of the 14 schools in Pohang, Pohang High School, and North Korean National Schools near the epicenter, cracks occurred in test centers and other building walls. Pohang High School had the most severe cracks and the back story of Pohang Girls ' High School collapsed. There were even falling wall tiles at the Pohang Girls ' Jeonja High School and Yuseong Girls ' High School. The preliminary test site, Pohang Joongang High School, also showed cracks. Under such circumstances, even if students take the test as scheduled, they can not perform well in an unstable state of mind, and the damage to the facility could cause disruptions in English listening tests.Park Chul-hong, a reporter for the College Scholastic Ability Test (Gwang-ju = Yonhap News Agency), said, "" We should keep one more week to ourselves. "" According to the plan, the exam questions were to be distributed to exam centers on July 16, but will be kept under police vigil for a week as the CSAT was postponed. Students in affected areas were also prosecuted for taking the exam under the more severe conditions, even if the test was to be completed without major accidents. However, there were also strong objections to delaying the CSAT, which is the nation's main concern and crucial influence on entering university only a day earlier. Tests requiring thorough security were delivered to test centers across the country, requiring high management and costs, and that made the decision to delay, according to reports. However, it was not possible to delay the test only to certain regions. Considering this and the importance of the issue, a pan-governmental consultation was conducted on the postponement of the CSAT, not to mention the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Public Administration and Security, and the Presidential Office. Moon Jae-in, president returning from the Southeast Asian tour and report the earthquake in the private jet, he immediately convened an emergency meeting to discuss relevant. When asked when the postponement was decided, Vice Education Minister Bahk Chun-ran said, It was decided hastily (before the news conference), adding, There were many worries and disagreements within the government. As if he was aware of the unprecedented postponement, Kim said, Understand that it was a tough decision to make with the safety of test-takers first, and ask the examinees to stay calm for a week. kong@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"

"Most retreats, part-time and monthly living … lonely [CBS ' Cisazaki's Law Center's Law Center's Law School Life.] Average retirement age : 1,000 or less children, who will never be forced to retire when they turn 18 or older, are forced to do so. For one reason or another, there are teenagers who live in child care facilities, childcare centers, and so on. But when you turn 18, you have to leave that facility. They call it the exit boy, the end of care child. I feel really sorry for them. Let's get this straight today. Come on in, Director Ahn Jin-geol of the People`s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy.  How are you?  ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > At the age of 18, you are legally obligated to leave the building, right?  ^ Anzingal ^ yes. That's what the Child Services Act defines. But it's not just this time, it's also the whole time that this has been a problem, but it's the issue with the 18-year-olds voting rights. You're too young to give it to me. You're too young to vote. ◇ Use of government officials > ask to leave?  Anjingal : Go out and live alone in this dangerous world. I'll raise my voice a little today. I don't think this is right. So, for example, get ready to go out into the society a little bit, maybe at the age of 19 or 20, or send someone who's not ready to stand up and support themselves, and then go into a public rental house. As I mentioned earlier, there are about 2,000 retirements per year from 1000, and they are actually teenagers.  ◇ Government service > over 1000 a year? ♫ Anjin-gal > It was really thrown out to the world alone.  ◇ Government use > I mean it. Are you just telling me to go out recklessly? Are you giving me a little support?  Ahn Jin-geol > The subsidy amount is decreased by one to five million won per local government office. I left this in the hands of local authorities. But in other countries, children and teenagers usually take care of each other on a national level.  ◇ Government use > But it is not from the central government, is it? ♫ Anzingal : It is a local government project. We have a revision to the Children's Welfare Law that the central government is responsible for. At the maximum, the support fee of five million won does not allow me to pay rent.  ◇ There is no guarantee.  Mr Anzingal : Yes, it is. Now the deposit basically requires around 100 million won for the worst facilities in Seoul.  ◇ Government use.  ^ Anzingal ^ right. There is also a rental support system, but it says that up to 80 million won a year will be given as a loan at the annual interest rate of two percent. It's very competitive and it's not easy to rent, is it? And then there was some self-help support.  ◇ Government service > support facilities? ♫ Anjin-gal > Yes. I mean, he retired, but at a child shelter. I can't live on the streets. So there are 12 locations around the country. Including three places in Seoul.  ◇ Government use > 12 locations around the country  Ahn Jin-gul > But there are 385 people in the garden.  ◇ Government service > 12 locations altogether?  Ahn Jin-gul : I mean, from 1000 to 2000, there are dropouts of home every year, by the way, 385. The rest of you have to go somewhere else by yourself. You have to stand up for yourself, really, so you go to the public service, the back room, or something like that, if you're wrong.  ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > Even if you go there, you need to pay a monthly rent at all. I have to make a living and how do I make a living?  If you go to places like Goshitel, a person I know very well, the rent is also between 350,000 won and 400,000 won.  ◇ Government use > I mean it.  Ahn Jin-gul : So when I checked, most of these people don't get a job yet. I can't go to school right away. The college entrance rate is less than half that of young people in their 20s to 30s. Employment is less than 50 percent of all jobs, and 50 percent of them earn only 1.2 million won. But they say it costs more than 1.3 million won per month or to live. You know it because we've been in the city before. It costs more than one million won.  Among them, housing is the most problematic. The fee is 350,000 won and 400,000 won per month. So, you can't live in this state, and you tell them to leave the area first, and then they leave, and then they just accept the rest of them in their own homes, and then they run away from home if they don't. I can reflect a little on how we are neglecting this situation and raise our voices.  ◇ Jung Kwan-yong : You said that the entrance rate to universities or places like this is less than half that of your age.  ^ Anzingal ^ right.  ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > If you attend university or a junior college like that, it will be easier to get a job again.  Mr Anzingal : Yes, it is.  ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > It is also more difficult to get a job since it is not working.  Into a vicious circle  ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > So you usually work as a part-timer after all?  Mr Anzingal : Yes, it is. They're going to do simple labor. So, it is said that when you work, you can only get half of the jobs, but when you work, you earn between one hundred and 1.5 million won a month. There are many types of work, such as service workers or temporary or temporary workers. And they get warm support from their parents and from society, even from college. The average university entrance rate is 70 percent. But they're alienated, they don't have parental support, and they don't have a lot of social support, they don't have a country to pick up, they're now facing this situation in local governments.  ◇ Government service > In reality, I will stay in such a institution for a long time and leave the hospital. Connect anonymously. Hello.  Hello, junior high and low school student  ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > How old are you now?  I am 22 years old now.  Are you a student?  I graduated from university in February this year and I am currently working for a job.  ◇ You graduated from a junior college?  D.A. Pulso  ◇ Government service > What do you want to do? What kind of job are you looking for now?  We are struggling to find any kind of occupation.  I graduated in February, but I have not been able to get a job since it is November. Right?  D.A. Pulso  ◇ Government service > private independence, does it mean that there is no housing cost?  D.A. Pulso  ◇ Government service > How do you manage to pay for your living?  I am just working as a job-hunter with you. That's what we're meeting for you. I tried meat restaurants, a wedding hall, and now I work at a movie theater.  ◇ Government use > How long have you been staying at a nursery?  I was a little longer than other friends. I've been here for 17 years.  ◇ Government use > 17 years since you were born in a day care facility, and now you are on your own for two years, right?  D.A. Pulso  ◇ Government service > How many friends did you have withdrawn from the nursery?  I think there were approximately seven retired teenagers.  ◇ Jung Kwan-yong and seven others are now on their own. Isn't it so?  As a teenager, I feel frustrated when I was in the facility, but now I live independently.  ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > So, only connected friends of those seven went to live independently?  D.A. Pulso  ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > Why did you go to the Independence Hall?  I wanted to study at the University of California, Youth, and University, but I had to research and find out about it to get some financial help.  ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > Then, how are friends who retired together doing? Can I get in touch with you?  I sometimes contact you as a teenager. I heard that most of you are doing part time jobs like this.  ◇ Government use > Then are you all in need of rooms?  I think I have been saving monthly rent room. I don't have much support for self-support, so I found that all of my friends are using the monthly rent to do so.  ◇ You said you have a loan support system, don't you think few friends use it?  D.A. Pulso There isn't much.  ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > is still young and needs more protection, but now no one around has actually helped him or her.  D.A. Pulso But here I am talking to my self-help teachers.  ◇ For government reasons > You should find a job right now, but if you want to say anything last, feel free to say something.  As a teenager, I have many worries about being unprepared for this independence, and I don't know what to do next.  ◇ Government use > aigo gwan .. .. I hope you can cheer up and get a good job soon. Thank you today.  D.A. Pulso  ◇ Government use > I heard it now Among the people who retired together, the only friend who went to the self-help group is this friend, and the rest of them were just a month old."
"I get three meals a day, and I work part-time. That's exactly what Director Ahn Jin-gul said.  ^ Anzingal ^ right. I don't know what will happen since I live from hand to mouth. And I think some of you have to live as a basic provider. It was surveyed that 40.7 % of the basic living supply after the actual protection was closed. So it's going to fall directly into the poor. And a lot of it is owing to the debt, most of it 35 percent living and 33 percent medical bills.  ◇ Government service > Living expenses and medical expenses resulted in debt.  Ahn Jin-gul : So there is a big difference between being with family and parents and having nothing. And I said, "" Well, first of all, it's a question of cost, and it's a job, but it's a question of how to get to work, and it's a shame and despair that I'm suddenly going to be alone, because I'm too young to vote for the world, and I don't really want to vote for them. As I said before, the biggest problem is housing, for one thing, you get a good night's rest. So for example, you can connect to public rental housing, and if you don't have public rental housing, you can have more in your existing facility, and if you have a public rental home, you can move it to a small rental home, and you can have a lot of today. With such facilities, the central government is fully responsible.  And then, for example, what is the self-help support fee of one to five million won? How would you live with this? Let's go up a little bit. Next year's budget is now 430 trillion.  Ahn Jin-gul, secretary general of the People`s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy (photo : Sisazaki) ◇ Strategyo training until you find a job, or else you can get a job, and you can do this.  Mr Anzingal : Yes, it is. Now, college students are also changed to pay back when they get a job, or they're asked to pay off their income after they get a job, or they're even asked to pay off a college degree, or they're asked to do a certain kind of thing when they get a job.  ◇ Government use > other countries do so?  Ahn Jin-gul : In the United States, various programs are being prepared to live independently for children who need protection. Even though you are older, live with one teacher and three or four retreats before you become independent.  ◇ Government service > One teacher and three or four retired employees should live together.  Ahn Jin-gul : Then, you check your independence ability or condition, and then you are forced to resign. So, I can see Japan is very thorough in its follow-up efforts. So, it provides customized counseling and help to individual problems that can enter the society.  ◇ Government use > Okay. I have the right answer. It is not up to local authorities. The central government should put in some of this money. And he would keep it protected until he could earn some money, and keep it protected and educated.  Mr Anzingal : Yes, it is. Income, housing, connection. So, if you think you can stand on your own two feet, you are 19 and 20 now that your country is an adult. I think you can step back then. These students, they were talking about 1,000 to 2,000. Not quite so many It won't cost that much. And next year's Korean budget is already 430 trillion. It's more than 500 trillion won for local governments. It is a layer that our society can warmly support.  ◇ Government use > to this day. Thank you for your efforts.  Mr Anzingal : Thank you.  ◇ Jeong Gwan-yong : I was the head of Ahn Jin-geol of the People`s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy.

Although the CSAT was postponed, the school could close as scheduled, said the school is looking forward to the new Bluehall battle ground e-sports and new air.Kim Joon-beom (Yonhap news agency) : A day after the earthquake, officials at Pohang High School in North Gyeongsang Province closed their notices at the main gate. The first day of the show is expected to last all day, but the problem is the weekend. Jistar attracted more students after the CSAT each year when it opened on the day of the CSAT, but this year, the CSAT was delayed, making it difficult for students to come to school on weekends. Last year, Gistar was expected to draw more than 219,000 viewers last year, but it is still important to wait and see if she reaches her goal. It`s hard to predict the number of visitors because it is natural disasters and the first time we have seen them, Gistar said cautiously. Usually, Moley has many test takers after the test, but this year`s schedule makes it impossible, so it is likely to have an impact on the weekend box office, an official of the game industry said. 676 companies from 35 countries participated in the event, and the number of booths rose by 5.0 percent year-on-year to 857. srchae@yna.co.krPohang City is planning to ask Prime Minister Lee to designate a special disaster area.Let's take a look at Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon's visit.Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon : If you are going to have a hard time in the world and are having an uneasy and uneasy night, let's give a cheer to Pohang citizens, especially to those who couldn't make it home at night and didn't know when they were going to sleep.I would like to give my own comfort first.Although I also told you in Seoul yesterday, Mayor Lee Kang-duk, Governor Kim Kwan-yong, and Director Kim, I appreciate your good initial response.And I hope you are very concerned, Congressman Park Myung-jae and Kim Jeong-jae.I think we should continue to work with them.In urgent emergency as an official letter yesterday and it was, my president will an emergency meeting of top aide, to open the necessary steps.And I would like you to know the scene first through Kim Bu-kyum, Minister of Public Administration and Security, especially when you look at the situation of the site, I think you can see how you're going to do the CSAT. Furthermore, as director Lee Young-woo said, the Ministry of Education originally planned to take the CSAT itself.I had a talk at a news conference at the Education Ministry around 4 yesterday, but I was about to announce the postponement of the CSAT at 8 p.m. as the situation got bigger and I had an opinion from the field.First of all, I will do what I have to do right now, what I have to do over the long term, what needs to improve the system, and what needs to be done right now can be done with restoration of damages and support for citizens.Both of these, and I will try to avoid overstarting centrally on the immediate response of disaster recovery and civic support.Each agency, please follow the manual for each unit. And this morning I told the ministers that the principles of site preference are for the administrative system and the management system. From an administrative level, Pohang City will be in the front row, North Kyongsang Province will be in the back row, followed by the Ministry of Public Administration and Security, the Central Disaster Prevention and then other related agencies.POSCO E&amp;C will do so in the following future by prioritizing and respecting the opinions of Pohang City.I think it is most right and shouldn't the nation's problems be worse than Pohang's opinions on delaying the CSAT?I say I will do so.Let me tell you a little while ago about the request of the head of Pohang City Hall, the governor of Gyeongbuk Province, and two councillors.First of all, the special assistant ministry for disaster safety will execute 4 billion won today.I would say it is much more than a race.It called a meeting of related ministers at 8 o'clock in the morning, but gave the direction to the Minister of Public Administration and made decisions.I think it will be carried out before the end of today.The second is to match the scope of declaring special disaster areas, because the damage is growing to a point where it is hardly necessary to discuss it.We were just watching carefully what Pohang City would think, but we also decided to set out to declare a special disaster zone, because Mayor Lee Kang-duk obviously requested it.▶ Collecting video news.

"[MoneyToday Kim Se-gwan] It's been 13 years since MoneyToday's campaign to establish a healthy digital culture. The digital world, formerly wired internet oriented, is expanding its scope rapidly. In particular, the fourth industrial revolution led by AI (AI), robot technology, and life sciences is emerging as a global issue. In Korea, artificial intelligence, Internet services, and autonomous driving cars have been actively developed since Alphago shock, which broke down nine artificial intelligence agencies last year. Our society is rapidly moving beyond an information society into an intelligent society. The development of such technologies is expected to enrich the lives of human beings, but one can not avoid the shadow on the back. As the fourth industrial revolution is expressed as an opening act, cyber violence, hacking, and other side effects such as bipolarization depending on the degree of information access are inevitable. This year's u clean campaign will focus on the right intelligent information, social and ethical cultures in preparation for the 4th industrial revolution.Kim, a 30-year-old businessman who has a son who is becoming increasingly younger than his age, has never dreamed of going out with a child without one. When eating out, going to the store or riding in a car, Kim looks for video clips on her smartphone. A free-spirited child gave a smartphone to keep others out of trouble, or to calm the disturbed child. Even when she was at home, it became common for her to give her a smartphone to her baby. They give smartphones to do house chores such as washing the dishes, cleaning, and even when they want to relax. Before long, smartphones are mothers and fathers. Still, it is awkward to take any action. I wonder if it would do any harm to our child. But I got used to being too comfortable. Can't get enough of it. I just feel great about my parents who raised their children without smartphones. ▽ Smartphones Addiction=The problem of addiction to smartphones is not recent. As the supply rate of smartphones increases, addiction patterns are growing among adults and children. Recently, a new word was coined, "" smunk (smart phone + zombie), "" which refers to pedestrians looking only at smartphone screens. The biggest problem is that the age of smartphone addiction is decreasing. As smartphones and tablet PCs that can show video clips on the road become mandatory items for childcare, addiction to smartphones by the young and the young has increased sharply. According to the report released by the Ministry of Science and Technology (Science and Technology) and the Korea Information Technology Agency (MIC) in 2016 (Korea Internet (smartphones) and mobile phone users aged between 10-19), the rate of addiction decreased by 17.6 % (smartphone addiction %) by 17.9 % It is the largest increase of its age. Less than value has matured before the smartphone addiction among youngsters is a problem, the body nor the inclination to babies and toddlers, just the beginning of excessive physical contact with smart phone.The development as well as a negative impact in terms of emotional self-regulation, that the diagnosis of Experts. ◇ Can negatively affect brain development…The possibility of psychological and physical disorders=The are experts who say that the most serious side effect that can occur is if children are exposed to smartphone addiction. Hyperticism, or hyperthyroidism, in which strong stimuli on smartphones relatively lower the left hemisphere, right hemisphere syndrome, and strong stimuli alone can cause an imbalance in my children.Smartphone addiction can cause problems in psychological and emotional terms, too. Not allowing smartphones to be used can cause psychological anxiety, and in the long run, problems in building patience or developing will. In some cases, this can cause mental problems that can not distinguish between reality and imagination.When children are at an early stage when physical development is important, addiction to smartphones can cause a growth disorder. As they often look down on the screen of their smartphones, they can suffer from symptoms such as dry eyes, short sight, and poor hearing, as well as swelling eye syndrome and scoliosis. ◇ Worldwide efforts to prevent baby smartphones = recently, we too proposed a law that prevents children from being overly exposed to smartphones. Many people, not just family members, but society, say that the system should solve the problem.The European Union has been promoting "" Safer Internet Programme for Internet safety "" since 2012, and Japanese citizens have been encouraged to take advantage of its ' Safer Internet Programme ' approach. There are also moves to solve smartphone addiction among children with a legal system. In Taiwan, digital devices are prohibited from being used by infants under the age of 2, and parents and guardians will be fined if children aged 2 to 18 experience symptoms of overmounding their smartphones. In the United States, digital devices for children under 18 months are prohibited from being used for digital. Korea recently proposed a law aimed at preventing children from becoming addicted to smartphones. It is a revision to the Framework Act on National Information Service by National Council Member Kim Kyung-jin and a revision to the Child Child Support Act, which made it obligatory for Kim to have children's homes and kindergartens educated under their obligations. "" Because of the increased supply of smartphones, the increase in working couples, and the spread of children's content, it is becoming more important for parents to hand over smartphones to their children, "" Kim said, "" to emphasize the importance of parents ' education in the prevention of preschoolers.

"Members of the MultI-Cultural Children's Choir sing at the "" Jinzabred House Snow Town Charity Concert "" in the Seoul Hotel lobby, Impirial Palace, Nonhyeon-dong, southern Seoul, Monday. ▽ News 1 / News 1 / Yun-seong : At the age of 36, a woman who married a husband is 27.8 years old (Sejong = News 1) ; Choi Kyung-hwan is the most talented journalist in Vietnam. China has accounted for the largest number ever since statistics were compiled, but it reversed its ranking for the first time last year. Human exchanges with Vietnam are on the rise, and it appears that changes in the system of granting permanent residency for ethnic Koreans of Chinese origin have affected the country. According to the Statistics Korea National Statistical Office's report on the dynamic statistics of multicultural marriages in 2016, there were 27,709 marriages, down by 753 points and 3.4 percent from 24,462 a year earlier. In 2016, the total number of marriages decreased 7.0 percent year-on-year, while that of multicultural marriages decreased 3.4 percent, resulting in a relatively small decrease in the number of marriages. Multicultural marriages account for 7.7 percent of all marriages, up 0.3 percent from the previous year. Vietnam ranked first with 27.9 percent of wives from abroad who were married to multicultural countries, followed by China with 26.9 percent and the Philippines with 4.3 percent. Since statistics were compiled in 2008, the percentage of Chinese wives has continued to decrease. It dropped to 29.9 percent in 2012 from 38.6 percent in 2008. Meanwhile, Vietnam saw its peak decline from 27.6 percent in 2010, but has been on the rise since 2015. Lee Ji-yeon, director of the Statistics Korea's demographic movement, said, "" Although Vietnam is considered to have been affected by the growing number of Koreans entering the country in the form of jobs and training, it was thought that marriages were not necessarily affected by the influence of the Korean people who belonged to Korean families in Vietnam. ■ News 1 : Bang Eun-young, designer of multicultural cultures, had the highest number of husbands in China with 9.9 percent, followed by the U.S. with 6.4 percent and Vietnam with 2.6 percent. Compared to last year, the share of China and Vietnam rose, while that of the U.S. and Japan decreased. Husband who married in a multicultural society had the highest percentage of over 45 years old at 24.6 percent, followed by those in their early 30s (20.4 percent) and late 30s (19.2 percent). In the case of wives in their late 20s, 28.2 percent were in their 20s, followed by 21.4 percent in their early 30s and 18.9 percent in their early 20s. The average age of a husband's first marriage was 36.0, up 0.6 from the previous year and that of his wife's was 27.8, down 0.1 from the previous year. The average age difference between men and women for their first wedding was 8.2 years old, up 0.7 years from a year earlier. Husband and wife were the most visible in multicultural marriages with 78.9 percent, and wives of the same age were the most important with 15.5 percent and 5.6 percent. 40.2 percent of married couples with husbands and relatives of 10 years old or older were found to have been married, up 2.5 percent from a year ago.The number of multicultural marriages was 5838 in Gyeonggi-do (5838), 4818 in Seoul (488), and 1280 in Gyeongnam (1280). In each region, multicultural marriages accounted for 9.8 percent of people in Jeju, 9.4 percent in South Jeolla Province, 8.6 percent in North Jeolla Province, and 6.0 percent in Daejeon. In 2016, the number of multicultural divorces decreased by 656 cases (- 5.8 percent) from the previous year (1287 cases) to 10,631. Compared to the 1.7 percent decline in divorce in 2016 (107,000 cases), the reduction in the number of multicultural divorce was very small with 5.8 percent, and the trend has continued since 2011. The most lasting marriage period for multicultural divorced couples was 38.2 % (5 + years to less than 10 years), 36.7 % (36.7 %) and 17.7 % (10 + years in order). The portion of married life expectancy has decreased from 78.2 percent in 2008 to 36.7 percent in 2016, but is still higher than the 21.4 percent of births of Korean divorces."
"As usual, I went to school on 16th in Seoul, and I heard that the exam was delayed due to the stress and stress caused by the exam. Kim Kyung-rok, reporter of Pohang University of North Gyeongsang Province, was delayed by an earthquake on May 16. High school seniors, who had worn heavy jumpers on their training uniforms, went to school in Seoul from early hours. Even though the school was closed for the day, about twenty students unpacked and began studying in its study room from 7:30 a.m., and by 10:00 a.m., more than thirty students had filled the room. Students have been studying hard with the thought of the end of the day, and when they say, "" I will do my best for another week, "" they say, "" I feel dizzy "" and "" let my teacher and parents know what's going to happen. "" Despite the unprecedented delay in the CSAT due to natural disasters, test-takers are returning to their normal lives after only one day. The Education Ministry and the Board of Education issued closing guidelines for high schools nationwide on July 15, but some schools ordered all teachers to go to work and take lunches for their seniors, just like on weekdays. Most of the schools that closed were also careful for principals, vice principals, and teachers who went to work and for those who opened their study rooms and classrooms to study as usual. School officials remove banners warning students at Dongbang High School, the 27th district exam site of Daejeon Metropolitan Office of Education, Thursday morning, when the 2018 College Scholastic Ability Test was delayed by a Pohang earthquake.When the Education Ministry announced earlier that it would postpone the CSAT for a week before the test, some test-takers shed tears or ran out of their homes, losing control. Song Hyeok-jun (Seoul Whimoon High School) said, "" I was so surprised to hear that the CSAT was postponed that I called my friend several times and kept running around the house. "" A senior high school student in Seoul who cried over an exam also said, I was thinking of going to an idol concert after the college entrance exam, adding, I don`t know whether I should prepare for the exam more. Most of the test takers did not even know that there was an earthquake. Test takers did not often use their cell phones or 2G phones to focus on their studies, so they were not notified of the emergency messages or of their postponement of the CSAT on time. A senior high school senior from Gimpo, Gyeonggi Province, said, The entire family turned off their cell phones in the morning, as it was on the eve of the CSAT. After studying abroad, I came home after 10 p.m. and turned on my cell phone to check the weather on the 16th, when the CSAT was held up, he said. Lee said, I thought it was a myth at first and turned it into a false story. Tell your friends, ' Is this a true story?"" It took dozens of texts to start accepting them as reality, "" she said. Although they decided to keep their minds to open their textbooks, when the final exams after the CSAT and the often-school-specific exams were delayed one week later, students complained, It was frustrating to see how long they were going to take so many tests. As I was preparing for college admission on time, I was pushed back to the sixth day of next month and then I was pushed back to 12th, said Seo Young-seok, a senior at Buram High School, who was preparing for the exam. Moon Il-won, a senior at Moonil High School, said, We have interviews and essays soon after the CSAT is over, and we have to check the exact date and location of each screening, which is a lot of inconvenience. High schools also have to revise their academic schedules. Most high school students plan to take the final exams on July 20-22 after taking the exam, said Joo Seok-hoon, principal of Mirim High School. High school students from 10 to 2 are also scheduled to make a nationwide joint evaluation on July 22. However, as the CSAT is delayed to July 23, all classroom desks and chairs need to be relocated to the form of exam rooms by July 22, so the final exams for the high school seniors and the joint nationwide evaluation schedule should be postponed. Lee Chang-woo, vice president of Seoul High School, not only talked about final exams, but also scheduled to attend class to cancel appointments of high-profile figures and performances organized by teachers to help them design their careers and advancement. Regarding the situation, high school seniors seemed to accept it calmly, calling it personally upsetting but unavoidable. Kim Young-seong (Seoul Whimoon High School 3) said, "" When I first heard about the postponement of the CSAT, I was surprised and surprised, but when I saw the news that Pohang University of Science and Technology's earthquake was seriously affected, I changed the date. "" Pohang students said, "" It would be very shocking to see a crack in the schools and home and aftershocks, but it would be unfair to proceed with the CSAT as scheduled. "" If I don't feel personally uncomfortable and sorry about the postponement, I think everyone in Pohang would be right, even if I think Pohang students took the test were to take it all. The wall of a Dasedae house in Pohang City, North Gyeongsang Province, has collapsed due to an earthquake on July 15. Teachers and admissions experts also advise you to accept positively and take it calmly when it is decided. Whimoon Whimoon High School principal Shin Dong-won said, "" I could have lost my study patterns due to the sudden postponement of the CSAT with a student.

"Pohang ... It has been observed that the geological structure has stabilized since the earthquake began to break out over the past year, but the argument of Gyeongju being in the wake of the massive earthquake has been focused on the ongoing progressive movement of earthquakes.Unlike the Gyeongju earthquake, this time, I could sense shaking nationwide. Kim Young-hee, a professor of the earth's environmental science department at Seoul National University, said, The quake hit 15 kilometers underground last year but this time it was 9 kilometers shallow, allowing for better energy transfer.Geologists have predicted a massive earthquake with a maximum Richter scale of 6.5 to 7.0 on the Korean Peninsula.◇ The tectonic plates of the peninsula were damaged, '' said Dr. Lee Yoon-soo, a researcher at the Korea Institute of Geostratism and Natural Resources Development. The Earth has a mantle over its inner core and above it are plates of Earth's giant land mass that touch each other. Tectonic plates slide on the mantle. When tectonic plates push each other, the two sides can push each other, and later, the fault lines will cross in the process of releasing the force. It is an earthquake that happens.Dr. Lee Yoon-soo explained, It appears that the force sent from the west to the south, pushing the Indian plate all the way to the Himalayas, was used to cause the eastern Pacific plate to resist and slide in the north. More than a year ago, Gyeongju Earthquake struck a city by sliding an unknown fault between Yangsan Fault, which passes southwest of Gyeongju, and Moryang Fault, which is located in the west of it.The original earthquake was mostly on the border, where tectonic plates collided. Examples are the Sichuan earthquake and the Japanese earthquake. The Korean Peninsula was called the earthquake-safety zone because it was inside the Eurasian Plate. However, as Korea has been hit by a massive earthquake recently, existing assumptions are collapsing. Dr. Lee said, "" When you press the ball up and down, it sticks out from the left and the right, "" adding, "" When the tectonic plates are faced, the effects of these are transmitted to complex systems inside the tectonic plates. ""◇ The science community of earthquake and domino effect in Kyushu, Gyeongju, Pohang University of Science and Technology focuses on the fact that the earthquake occurred again in a similar location to that of Gyeongju. Experts say the Japanese earthquake Kyushu earthquake hit last year, and that the aftermath of the Pohang earthquake is the "" earthquake domino effect. "" Pohang earthquakes are an extension of the Gyeongju earthquake a year ago, said Kim Young-seok, professor of the office`s global environmental science department, adding that similar earthquakes are more likely to occur in a series like Domino's.Residents ' shelters have cold blankets ... - Residents move a box of blankets from their homes to the gym in Pohang City, North Gyeongsang Province, Friday. After the earthquake, many academics insisted on closely watching the signs of an earthquake for three years. Hong Tae-kyung, a professor of Earth Systems Sciences at Yonsei University, told an international journal at the beginning of this year that the area of fault fractures caused by last year`s Gyeongju earthquake was much larger than the estimate of the Earth's quality. Professor Hong, warned that ""East Sea is an earthquake fault the race the other can cause earthquakes."" based on this.Professor Kim Young-seok said, A magnitude 5 quake happens not from the main part of a fault but from twigs, saying, If the main part of a mass production fault or nearby Ulsan fault moves, an earthquake of more than 6 magnitude could occur. Sun Chang, director of the National Earthquake Research Center, said earlier that "" earthquakes usually occur again in areas where earthquakes have occurred in the past. "" "" Production faults can cause earthquakes at any time. "" In the past, the one-story region of Yangsan was recorded as having earthquakes with a magnitude of 6.5 or higher during the Joseon Dynasty.Two hours after the earthquake, an aftershock of 4.6 occurred. Experts say aftershocks are likely to exceed three months and one year. However, it is hard to predict where the next quake will hit again. This is because they do not fully understand where the cracks are. The government is investigating the nearby one-story area after the Gyeongju earthquake. The company will draw a map of the active fault around the Yangsan fault starting next year.[scientific reporter Lee Young-wan [direct to Dooson.com] - Cooprietts ' Daily & Chosun.com, no unauthorized reproduction and redistribution by the National Meteorological Administration in Seoul on July 15(Photo : Yonhap news agency) [Daily Hanjeongseon] reported on July 15 at 2:29 p.m. The magnitude of 5.4 earthquake and the magnitude of 2.0 aftershock follows the quake in North Pohang City. According to the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) on July 16, a magnitude 3.6 aftershock occurred in an 8-kilometer area north of Pohang City in North Gyeongsang Province at 9:02 a.m. Three aftershocks have occurred on a magnitude of 3.0 or higher. At 2:32 p.m. on July 15, magnitude 3.5 aftershocks hit the 7-kilometer area of North and South Jeolla provinces on July 15.The aftershocks of the magnitude 4.0 earthquake occurred at 4:49 p.m. on July 15 in the northern part of Pohang City, North Gyeongsang Province. It was an aftershock of magnitude 4.3."
