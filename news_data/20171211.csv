Lobster, which is usually available at restaurants for tens of thousands of won per person, is considered a symbol of luxury menus and expensive menus.`` It's a menu that wasn't able to be concluded easily because it was too expensive, '' Saingot told CBS Nocut News, a poor environment surrounding the school. She tried to move to school several times. I prepared for the exam with the hopes that the hard-working students and faculty will step up their efforts amid the difficult situation, the official said.As boys, the reaction was not very violent.

Nocut News (www.nocutnews.co.kr) Overheating the market for piracy and redistribution, and a snowball on similar receiving and reporting scandal that says the government's currency regulation on second Sea Story should be concerned before the "" Industrial Shubit "" digital street is opened. The price of the new beat coin decreased by 44 percent for two days. A citizen looks at the cipher suite of the Korea Exchange in Mugyo-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul yesterday. [Jang] There was a Bitcone Bubble. Bitcone prices, which had soared to 2,290,000 won on July 8 in the crypto-currency (so-called virtual currency) exchange, went down to 139,100 won on July 10. It fell 44 percent two days ago. The South Korean government has set off a burst of bubbles. It was also rumored that on July 8 when Bitchin recorded its highest price ever, the Ministry of Justice will review banning the transaction of encrypted currency. Investors were horrified. In the blast of Bitcone, those who were about to jump even one step ahead threw the water to jump first. Panic cell launched.The Justice Ministry is worried that the bit-coing frenzy might recur the "" second Sea Story. "" Sea Story was legally introduced to the market in December 2004 when it was judged as ` using 18 years of age ` by the Korea Media Rating Board, which was in charge of regulating games. However, the effects of the gambling and addiction were serious. There was a run of people who wasted their fortune. Some even took their lives. The government drew up a related regulatory bill late in 2006. Critics said the government acted as the working class government, which was criticized for allegedly splashing people`s pockets after the mass increase in victims. There is a lot of damage associated with encrypted money. As many as 56 cases were requested by the Financial Supervisory Service to investigate similar cases of receiving money under the guise of cipher money from 2015. "" Some buildings in Gangnam are all multI-phone-dollar, "" a FSS official said. "" As the price of beatcone increases, it is usually said that old people should invest their money in coins similar to those of discount coins. "" Having defined the products as "" crypto-money = pass-and-for-issue, "" it is not possible to buy even products that are traded legally abroad. The Financial Services Commission recently stated that "" the bit-coined futures that are released in the U.S. market can not be used as the original assets of derivatives. "" However, it is questionable how effective the South Korean government's regulations will be. It is difficult to keep the market from operating because we need a basis law to set it up and pass the National Assembly, said an official at the ministry. The Chinese government has imposed a super-intensified ban on the use of encrypted currency, but failed to break the rising price of Bitcone. That is because of the properties of Bitcone. On the base of the bit coin is the block chain technique. It is a technology that is believed to lead the fourth industrial revolution. Unlike the legal currency, which has borders between borders, Bitcone has no barrier. If one country blocks the transaction, one can use the other country's exchange. Even when the domestic exchange closes, investment is possible through the overseas exchange. As premature regulations can nip things in the bud in the face of industrial development abroad, it is advised to wait and see. However, they are constantly warning of speculative risks to protect investors. The United States has clear principles. Regardless of the number of patients who have the right to receive protection, they are determined to stop money laundering. New York State is said to have approved the crypto-money exchange, but it only approves encrypted currency with cash-following techniques, and the rest are banned from trading at all, said an official at the commission. Japan is the most active country in cipher. Last April, the fund payment method was passed and Bitcone was recognized as an official payment method. However, the protection of investors is strict. It only gave the go-ahead to 11 places that have a company-level investor protection system via the Crypto-Collater Exchange. Kim Ho-min, head of Spart-end Investment Company, said, Korea`s possible focus on cipher currency and block chain technology, is what the government is worried about, as it may become an anachronistic strategy. OS representative Park Chang-ki said, "" Companies like Naver, NCsoft, and Nexon began to make IT bubblers in the late 1990s. "" But none of us could have missed out on the mobile revolution era's results, which was sparked by the iPhone. However, businesses agree that it is necessary to stabilize the cryptograph market, which has turned into a speculation zone. Only exchange opinions should be approved to provide investor protection, set age or investment limits when dealing, or to prevent money laundering or verification of the real name of illegal transactions. The exchange, which has failed to meet the investor protection standards or has left open deals suspected of illicit funds such as drugs, is set to stop issuing bank virtual accounts, said Kim Jin-hwa, co-president of the Korea Federation of Block Chain Association. It is also urgent to prepare a taxation system. This is because the legal nature of cipher money is unclear. Germany, which views cryptogamy as barter, imposes VAT. On the other hand, the U.S. and Japan do not impose VAT on cipher money by considering it as a currency. ◆ Money that is used to encrypt a block chain, such as cryptocurrency. Unlike coin, it was called virtual currency, which means it has no substance. The South Korean government calls it ' virtual currency. ' It is unified into the global language of cipher money.

"" ▲ Chung-ju's convenience store is claiming a minimum wage.(Not relevant to the photo engineer's specific facts) ⓒ North Chungcheong NewsNews A convenience store in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, reported a student who demanded minimum wage to 112 for theft. The plastic bags the convenience store reported were sold at 20 won per page. Police checked the footage on the CCTV that an arbitrate had taken from the store and checked the footage immediately at his home.The current working group has admitted to taking two 20-won envelopes on two occasions. Police are accusing parents of illegally taking two 20-won plastic bags to the Earth and calling the thief's house to ask for a random escort and to ask for an excessive number of party-timers.In particular, it was confirmed that the store did not pay the minimum wage, the weekly holiday allowance and the night shift allowance. Arvite and the convenient store were found to have engaged in a verbal battle with the minimum wage before reporting the theft, sparking a controversy over a retaliation.Around 10:10 a.m. on July 10, A, who lives in Cheongju, was startled by a call from the police. Police said the daughter of a 19-year-old was also reported to have committed theft, calling for her company to accompany her to the Earth.Mr. A woke his daughter up and went to the earth with a police patrol car waiting near his house. They arrived at a police station in Seowon Gu, Cheongju.Her daughter, B, was questioned by the police for about 10 minutes in front of her mother and blocked her documents. The police arrested him on suspicion of theft.A convenience store in Sugok-dong reported the stolen goods from convenience stores by Mr. B, and followed them around 112 a.m. yesterday.Did you report it for only 40 won? The store manager explained to the police officers who went to the store, "" After work, a part-timer bought the items and took them away without paying 20 won. ""A police official said, We believe there may have been other thefts from the items, so we asked for an investigation and took the suspect to the Earth as a random escort to investigate.In response, B admitted taking plastic bags without calculating them. The convenience store is finished at 12 p.m. I bought the necessary items from the convenience store, paid the check in the card machine, and put them in a plastic bag. It seems to have been done twice, including last week.I was so surprised to hear that it was a theft, Mr B said. I don`t think I would have been reported as a thief for not paying the plastic bag price of 40 won yet, said Park.Police have only confirmed once that they are currently taking plastic bags via CCTV footage. We checked the CCTV footage at the convenient store once, police officials said. But the convenience store raised suspicions of further crimes, arrested and investigated, adding, Two plastic bags, or 40 won in total, were they reported as theft? ▲ Cheongju Store announced the "" Arvite, "" a convenience store worker who demanded minimum wage, at 112 for stealing a 20-won plastic bag.(Photographs not relevant to the fact of the engineer) ⓒ Among the wage wars before the news theft report, the store manager and Mr. B exchanged a message one day before the theft report.The argument states that the minimum wage and the type of wage payment are off. B requested that the wages be paid on a scheduled date when the payment is due.In response, the store manager rejected the request, saying, If you quit, you will be paying the last day of the month. When I first said I had not heard the above clauses, the convenience store manager replied, "" All employees stay the same. ""Again, Mr B said, If you do not pay me the lowest (hourly) but do not pay me the lowest (hourly) wage. I will send you an account later.The store manager said, "" Pay according to the principle of probation. Use without payment, plastic, etc. Indiscreetly. Cleaning the store or cleaning the store is negligent. "" No deposit is made. Come and get it yourself. Pay direct payment has already been delivered Only time frame when it is due, said Lee.Afterwards, B again asked, "" Remove the plastic bag and the bag from the sale and send me with a weekly allowance. "" The store manager nailed the request of Mr. B to no deposit. Then I will report the minimum wage and the payment I owe you, he said.The two sides differed on the controversial minimum wage. A convenience store official said, We gave about 5800 won per hour to a close associate of the company`s whether or not to make a minimum wage. It is not a violation of minimum wage.As of 2017, the minimum hourly wage is 6470 won, said a staff member at a convenience store headquarters, asking only about 90 percent of employees to pay during the probation. It is not illegal.In response, B said, It was not an hourly payment of 5800 won. After calculating the bill, it was about 5,500,000 won per hour, said the ministry, refusing to give me day and night work allowance.Under the Labor Standards Act, workers who work between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. the following day are supposed to receive an additional 50 percent of their regular wage. Workers who work 15 hours a week are also required to get paid holidays. This is because he worked three days a week from 5 p.m. to 12 p.m.Regarding this, the convenience store refused to cover the story.

The revision provided legal grounds and procedures for getting involved in disputes between residents over intermediation of apartments. If the victim reported smoking between floors to the apartment management body (the apartment management office), it was recommended that the managing body enter the injured person's room to check the fact that the smoking was suspected and stop smoking by indirect inspection. If the management body made such a recommendation, residents would cooperate to prevent second-hand smoke damage. The government agency is acting as a kind of mediator.

"Lee Hae-young, a reporter for Bitcone [Yonhap News Agency] (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) : Companies are divided over whether to pay by using virtual currency Bitcone as a payment method. Bitcone prices have been fluctuating wildly, rising more than $ 1,000 a day last week, and sliding 40 percent in the second half of the week. Companies that receive Bitcone as a payment call have mixed expectations that soaring prices will make it easier for customers to open their wallets, and the pessimistic view that they will not be able to use their wallets for smaller payments due to heavier fees. The Japanese travel agency, HIS, which accepts Bitcone as its payment currency, said it was surprised to see more than the bitchman user had thought. The company has received Vitcons as payment calls from 38 stores in Tokyo since September 23. It is to increase the convenience of customers. It is said that one Bitcone payment is made every two days after the service starts. The company explained that the price hikes in Bitcone are definitely positive in terms of business. HIS hopes to add momentum to its demand for travel during the holidays and the graduation season next spring. Big Camera announced on July 8 that it would increase the upper limit per store, which can be settled with bit coins, from the previous 100,000 yen (about 1 million won) to 300,000 yen (about $ 13 million). Bitcone users have increased significantly and many customers use the bill up to the limit of 100,000 yen. If the ceiling is raised to 300,000 yen, it can counter sales of large refrigerators and high-end washing machines, as well as mass purchase of gifts by foreigners. While there are bit-coiners such as HIS or Big Camera, there are growing skepticism about the effect of being a sales pitch. Haichino, a Chinese restaurant chain that accepts Bitcone as its payment currency, said, "" Although the Bitchin payment increased from October to November, it was only a few cases per month. "" Although the price of the bit coin has soared, it does not affect the number of customers. According to Megane Super, an official with Likurt's Bitcone Payment System, less than 100 were used until November. It failed to meet the expectation of foreign tourists using it, and most of them were tested by Japanese. There are several small concert halls, restaurants, and bars available in the Japanese metropolitan area, but most of them do not have customers. Such discrepancy is due to the fees paid by employers. When the offline store pays the fee in bit coins, the user operates a smartphone application and transmits the coin from his or her electronic wallet on the virtual currency exchange to the other person's electronic wallet. Remittance fees vary depending on the type of exchange and purse, but 0.0004 to 0.0005 bit coin is typical. If it was the beginning of this year before the price surge, the fee would have been 650 yen (approximately 650-600 won) to 1,000 yen (approximately 10,000 won). It is not worth paying attention if the price is hundreds of thousands of yen, such as traveling abroad or large electric appliances, but it is definitely in the interest of paying by credit card when purchasing meals, small items or necessities. If you think the price of Bitcoin will go up tomorrow than today, it is natural to keep it rather than use it as a payment method. If a retailer that sells at least several hundred to thousands of yen in transactions receives a bit coin as a payment method, it can not be used by a customer who knows exactly what to lose. If the customer does not use the coin, the retailer must leave the coin at a distance, and if so, it will not increase the number of stores that can use the coin. As the price of a bit coin increases, the function of the currency weakens, thus, it is in a dilemma. Nippon Gaizai pointed out that the question is whether Bitcone can be considered as a currency.[AFP = Photo of Yonhap news agency ]lhy5018@yna.co.kr ▶ Report and inquiry (click!) ▶ Staff are busy at the Korea Aerospace Industry (KCO) headquarters in Sanam-myeon, Sacheon-si, South Gyeongsang Province.

In particular, the U.S. depended heavily on it. However, according to SIPRI, the Korean industry is becoming increasingly self-sufficient in arms as it has recently begun to grow rapidly.As Korea went through a major industrialization, Peter Beseman, a senior researcher at SIPRI, said, "" We are using more and more weapons and technology to compete with what Europe and the United States have provided. ""Jimon Beseman, a senior researcher at SIPRI, also said Korea is turning its eyes to its defense industry to meet its needs, and aims to achieve its goal of becoming a major arms exporter.This is not something to be seen as North Korea's threat.

According to SIPRI, the Korean government spending ratio is the highest in the world when excluding the divided regions of the Middle East and Africa.Last year, seven Korean defense contractors were included in the list of 100 SIPRI companies.

""Samsung Electronics ` Galaxy Note 8.4 was ranked at 1.5 percent, with the third place at 2.4 percent. Galaxy S8 was tied for fifth with the X20 share of the iPhone 6, iPhone 7, and BB, respectively. In addition, Shaomi's Hong Mi Note 4 and Opo's R11 were tied for ninth. If you divide the top 10 smartphones by brand, Apple is the top four, Samsung the top three, followed by Samsung the top three, sad ones, Shaomi the first, and Opo the second. Apple is at the center of the global smartphone market by taking first, second, and fifth spots. However, Samsung does not have many iPhone types, and since Samsung owns both low-country and expensive smartphones evenly, it can have a different market share in terms of brand. What's clear is Apple's dominance in November must have increased. The store forecast that the company`s $ 400 + premium smartphone market share will have been extended gradually in November as a result of the release of the iPhone X. The iPhone X was released globally on July 3 and was not included in this research. Counterpoint has not released its Global Smartphones Market report in November.Samsung Electronics received high marks for its price strategy.

According to Jang, former director of the Center for Genius, Lee Kyung-hyuk (39), was contacted by Samsung Electronics in October last year to ask Lee Young-kook, the first vice president of Samsung Electronics ` management team, if he could provide extra support. Lee asked to meet him in a week, but in the end, the meeting was unsuccessful. When asked whether Lee contacted Samsung as instructed by Choi, Yes, Choi said, I asked him to send out the budget plan for the following year. When the special prosecutor asked, "" Did Choi try to get the third funding of the Center for the Genius? "" (I should know better than to send me next year's budget). Jang also revealed the fact that Choi tried to rob the center of genius with an extra 300 million won. Chang was previously convicted of embezzling 220 billion won in funds from the center to the sports marketing company he runs under borrowed names, and was sentenced to two and a half years in jail in the first trial. We have transferred 220 million won more at Choi`s instruction to the school's sports bureau, and ordered Choi to pay the salaries of employees with the funds of the center, she said. "" Has Choi ever told you to withdraw 300 million won from the Center for the Genius? "" Choi asked the special prosecutor to turn it into an account and answered, "" Yes, that would be the case. "" Meanwhile, Jang, who appeared in court for the first time since being sentenced to jail on July 6 at her first trial, could not bear the swelling of emotion throughout her testimony. Jang could not say anything for about a minute, even though the judge told her to take an oath before starting testimony. She even wiped her fingers off her eyes. Jang then ended the oath with a tearful voice : I will tell you the truth without any reserve or aid. Jang's testimony was later revealed to be in response to the newspaper, swallowing her tears. hey1@newsis.com>"

"Park Hyung-ki (Seoul news 1) : Some Wall Street experts say, "" Bit-coin gifts are an opportunity to break up a virtual currency bubble, "" Bloomberg reported on July 10. Because I can bet on a decline in gifts. As the futures are released, investors can bet on a rise or drop. If major investors bet on the decline, the price of Bitcone will most likely find its place.Bloomberg gave a one-and-one-one answer to Bitcone, saying that some hedge funds were preparing for a downward bet.1. How is Bit-coin traded? : Bitcone is traded on a private exchange not officially recognized by the authorities. Private bit-coining exchanges have exposed a variety of issues, including delayed transactions and hacking. Investors only buy beatcoiner because of expectations for a future rise.2. What does it mean when the Bitcone futures are launched? : Gifts are deals that are made on condition that they are delivered at a certain time in the future. Investors can take a shot position. Take a bet on the price reduction. Then the price goes down. 3. Who provides gifts? : All major U.S. trading agencies provide gifts. The Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) first released Bitcond futures on July 10. The Chicago Board of Trade (CME), the world's largest futures exchange, is set to release the gift on July 18. NASDAQ is releasing Bitcone early next year.4. Why do they release gifts? : As the number of bit coins has soared recently, more and more people want to invest in them. Korea Exchange (CME) was reluctant to release the Bitcone futures, but as investors rapidly increased recently, they decided to release the ones. For traders, Bitcone is an interesting market. U.S. markets, including NASDAQ, are relatively stable. However, Bitcone is extremely volatile. Beatcoiner gifts will give traders a new world experience.5. What are the risks? : Price fluctuation. Therefore, some say it is too early to release the Bitcone gift. Three days before the official launch of the gift at CBOE, Bitcone climbed to nearly $ 20,000 in just 90 minutes on the GDAX exchange and collapsed to $ 16,000.Then, is the Bitcone gift a bad idea? : Some institutional investors feel that the bit-coined gifts are too fast. The Korea Futures Industry Association (FIA), which has major institutional investors subscribed as its member, criticized the public letter saying that it is premature to release gifts.We recently sent an open letter to the regulatory authorities, pointing out that public awareness and transparency are not enough to deal with the bills. The disclosure statement said that "" there has not been sufficient consideration for the potential dangers of bit-coining gifts, "" and opposed the introduction of the bit-money futures. 7. Then, is there any investor who makes a bet on the decline? Experts say that the gift will allow the customers to adjust the price of the beet coin. Some hedge funds are preparing to go down. Sinopark @Report! [News 1 Korea (news1.kr), The funeral expenses of the funeral limousine to run the remains from Ansan to the bathroom were not only moderately low, but also a lot of the funeral expenses, such as the food and funeral expenses, went to the 10th page on November 28. The funeral expenses for the Sewol were carried out by Ansan Office of Education on a budget of the Gyeonggi Office of Education.As the agency checked Ansan's budget performance, it found that 22 funerals had been held at the time. K funeral parlor, where 61 funerals are held, received an average of 5.2 million won per meal as food (excluding drinks and liquor). At that time, the meals per person was 15,000 won. That means it was provided for 350 people. But one of the funerals staff said, As it was the funeral of a young student, the funeral hall was empty because there were few visitors. I remember that the average number of people per empty stomach is less than 100 for the three days. One chapter report said, "" Most of the mourners were students, but the numbers were small. "" The students ate a lot, so they ate a lot of food, said the funeral parlor.At the funeral, about 9.2 million won was paid per funeral for food, drink and drink alone. A funeral parlor worker said, It was not the buzz at all. If the family said, ' You can stop giving, ' the funeral parlor kept pushing me, ' You don't have to pay, ' and they said, ' It's all free. ' An official at the funeral parlor said, "" There were only a few visitors, but the number of visitors was as high as 300, and it was higher than usual, "" adding up to seven million won for the regular funeral.It is not just the funeral halls K and A. One of the men who said, "" I worked on watch at another funeral parlor, "" answered, "" I had several boxes of expensive skates that the funerals offered, and the bereaved people wouldn't mind if I gave them a check. "" The average meal cost of 258 funerals in the Sewol accident was about 6.2 million won. On average, food costs about 3 million won for a typical funeral, said an official at the Korean Federation of Funerals.The average cost of funeral equipment such as the number used at the funeral of the Sewol victim was 2.67 million won per event. One funeral parlor, which held 16 funerals, saw an average of 38 million won. "" We've sold millions of won and we've sold them before, "" said an official from the funeral industry. "" I used expensive ones for burial, and cheap ones for make-up then. ""According to this reporter, "" If you rent a 100-pyong mortuary, it will cost you about 6 to 8 million won altogether, "" according to a consultation on the funeral parlor where you were in charge during the accident in March. However, the average cost of paying for the funeral in the Sewol issue was about 15 million won per person.An Ansan education office official who had executed the budget said, "" I felt that I had too much money when I received the receipts, but I didn't have the policy to pay as much to my bereaved family, and I didn't have the money to pay the most.

"Sung Ki-seon, president of the Korean Curriculum and Evaluation Board, announces the scores of the 2018 College Scholastic Ability Test at the ministry's public briefing room yesterday. The institute said, "" The ratio of first class students in the required field was 4.9 percent in the Korean language section, 5.13 percent in mathematics, 10.03 percent in English, and 12.84 percent in Korean history. "" December 11, 1717.12.11 / News 1 / News 1 ; Chang Soo-young, the head of the Korean News University Press, and Kim Jae-hyeon, the head of the KSAT analysis department at the municipal college (Sejong = News 1), said on Monday, It is the first time that the Head of the Board of Audit and Inspection has revealed a perfect score.The Korea Institute of Curriculum and Evaluation announced its results for the 2018 CSAT at the Sejong Building in Seoul.When asked whether he would continue to announce the perfect score, Sung responded, We will actively consider it.We will also test how the institute will disclose the results of the provisional attachment starting from next year`s mock assessment, he said. If the results of the exam are disclosed in advance, students can check the minimum academic performance standards frequently and determine whether or not they are required to attend the exams regularly or not to minimize possible confusion. Regarding the difficulty level of the 2018 CSAT, Sigija Valuation`s planning analysis office said, It is somewhat similar to last year`s CSAT, considering the combined scores of the first and second grades, or the ratio of grades.As for the surge in English first class ratios to 10 percent, Sigija said, The test criteria remained similar to last year, but the increase in the proportion of graduates and students ` preparation for learning improved slightly.The following is an interview with Sung Ki-seon, president of the Korea Curriculum & Evaluation Institute, and the planning analysis team of the KSAT. However, the results of this CSAT show that more than 10 percent of students will take the test. How should I look at this? ▶ Even if the students ask for similar questions, the ratio of students in absolute assessment can change according to their academic standards. The test standards were generally kept. It is also interpreted that the fact that the students felt that English was not an easy test during the two mock tests had an influence on their learning.- Remember that the first grade students in the English section were 5.4 % during the mock assessment in September. The time difference between the college entrance exam and the university is not that different, but the first grade rate has doubled since the beginning of the test, and the fact that the results of the exam have been kept on track is not convincing. ▶ Looking at changes in the characteristics of the student groups compared with the mock tests in September, graduates increased by 10 %. The increase in graduates may have affected, too. And as I said, I do not neglect learning English.- The results were obtained in the first year of the absolute evaluation conversion. If other subjects are also transferred to absolute evaluation, is there any countermeasures? ▶ As this announcement is to announce the results of the 2018 CSAT results, I do not think it is appropriate to comment on future direction.- Then, is it better that the first grade of English is more than 10 percent? ▶ (Times) Absolute evaluation is to assess the extent to which the achievement criteria presented in the curriculum are fulfilled. Students who faithfully complete the curriculum within the scope of their courses should take the questions to solve them. "" As a result, the results were produced.- What is the rate of retakers and undergraduates among the top grades by region? ▶ (Times) The part was not included in the analysis of CSAT results. I will make an analysis and make it public.- Are you curious about the percentage of people who are perfect candidates for each category? ▶ It is possible that the maximum number of people with perfect scores by area would encourage a line. And it does not meet the purpose of optional CSAT, which is to randomly choose an elective course. So do not calculate.- As discrimination in the English language field disappears, the institute's assessment of its strategy on time has become very difficult to draw up, however, there is nothing to say except the results of the survey by the Korea Institute of Testing and Evaluation (2015).- English is considered to be 30 % of the students who have been admitted to the second grade. The discrimination will significantly decrease compared to other areas. (br clear=all) We have no choice but to give a theoretical answer on that point. They made their questions according to the usual criteria set for the examination.I will say something about perfect candidates. The media and private institutes recently released perfect score holders based on the results of the provisional payment. There are nine graduates and two students in school, so it appears that the CSAT is definitely in the favor of graduates. As an exception, I will give you a brief explanation of the perfect score results. Students who earn the highest grades in English and Korean history after receiving a perfect score in Korean, Math, and Research (2 subjects) have seven students, seven graduates, and one examinee on the national examination. There are fifteen in all. Based on this, I don't think the CSAT was absolutely disadvantageous to or advantageous to students. And it was a equally challenging test for both students and graduates.- The ratio of students who are enrolled in the CSAT and graduates who are perfect for the College Scholastic Ability Test were announced was about the same as before. I didn't know (Sung Ki-seon) before but I did this time.If it's not absolutely in your favor, I think you should show us all about the past. ▶ (Sung Ki-seon) I'll check it out. I will have the opportunity to let you know as compared to the previous data. - It is the first time that the Head of the Board of Assessment has spoken publicly about the number of perfect candidates. Will he do so in the future? ▶ (Sung Ki-seon) I will actively review it. There are currently many questions about what information to disclose. If the information is released as soon as possible, it will greatly benefit the students. The result of a store, for example, is the same. If announced earlier, examinees can often check their minimum academic standards and receive help preparing for a standardized test. The method is under active consideration. I plan to do a test from next year's mock assessment. - How would you rate the overall difficulty of the CSAT? ▶ Considering the combined scores of Grade 1 and 2 classification standards by region and the ratio of Grade 1, the university's scores were similar to last year's CSAT or were rather easy.- There are no second grades in economics among social research areas. This happened because the highest ranked nation was at a loss.- What do you think about elective courses and options? ▶ (Times) Standard scores were adopted to minimize default. This year, the gap in standards is similar to last year when standards scores were relatively low. Arabic standards scores were always highest at 100, but were eased by 90 this time.- Check the percentage of people who are perfect in each area. ▶ Although I have never revealed the rate of perfect score, I will let you know by checking it out.According to the telecommunications industry on July 11, the three mobile carriers and the Ministry of Science and Technology and Information are discussing payment of the communication fee based on the mileage accumulated by mobile subscribers.SK Telecom gives five to ten million-won (1,000-3,000 U.S. dollars) to subscribers who use the term ' Rainbow Point, ' and LG U + (1,000-1,000 dollars) ' to pay as a flat rate fee.The Chosun Ilbo database is separated from the membership point of each carrier that is granted mileage every January but disappears if it is not used by its partner companies such as convenience stores, and has a 7-year validity. The automatic loss of mileage for the past four years and seven months between July and July of this year amounts to 787 billion won for KT (030200), 717.7 billion won for SK Telecom (017670), and 03264 billion won for LG U + (037.00).As the consultation is progressing in a positive direction, we expect to be able to pay by mile-miles-load from next year, said an official at the ministry.However, as the smart phones moved into the era, the number of user-based subscribers and fixed rates decreased. Because of this, the telecommunications industry predicts that not many users will benefit from paying for mileage communication. The remaining mileage available to subscribers is estimated to be less than 80 billion won for all three mobile phone companies.Most of the subscribers don`t actually benefit because they are on a monthly flat rate schedule, said an official at the telecom industry, referring to the extension of membership points as a way to extend the cost of payment by using mobile services.[Shim Min-gwan, journalist, bluedragon@chosunbiz.com]chosunbiz.com"
"A reporter from the Telecommunications and Service Association of Korea's eight city-surveillance survey (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) said, "" Korea's LTE speed is the fastest among the major cities in the world. The Korea Telecommunications and Service (KTOA) reported on the quality of broadband LTE and voice call services in eight cities outside of Korea on December 11, according to a survey released by the Korean government in December last year. Among the cities surveyed, Toronto had the fastest download speed of 69.56 Mbps. San Francisco's 43.18 Mbps and Tokyo's 42.32 Mbps. The slowest download city was New York City with only 30.05 Mbps. Korea`s average download speed stood at 120.09Mbps for the Science Department's survey on the nation's future. It is 1.7 times faster than Toronto and 4 times faster than New York. The average upload speed was 41.83 Mbps, about 1.6 times that of Toronto (26.87 Mbps) and 3 times that of New York (13.78 Mbps). The federation conducts quality surveys every year to compare the quality levels of mobile services in Korea with other major developed countries abroad. This year, the test was conducted by separating the administrative area, theme area (in congested areas, subways, and buildings), and vulnerable areas (on highways and trains). Research shows that coverage and speed in major cities are better than last year. However, the KTOA reported that the subway tunnels in New York, London, and Paris were not properly equipped with sufficient quality and could not be investigated. The quality assessment was carried out through the exclusive lines of the countries and late payment plans, and the measurement terminals were unified into the Galaxy S7 purchased locally. Voice call was investigated for more than 200 calls and data were obtained by measuring uploads and downloads between terminals and wired measurement servers.

As the Earth's temperatures go up and glaciers melt, we are unable to eat seals, which is the main food for polar bears, "" he said.He warned, "" If global warming continues as it is now, not only will polar bears die out, but the Arctic ecosystem itself will collapse. ""In fact, according to a joint study by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2014, polar bear populations have plummeted in the past decade.Polar bear populations have decreased by 700 in just six years from its main area of the Beaufort Sea, with the number of polar bears falling by 900 as of 2010, but are now guessing many more. The North Korean government, which has been tied up with the sanctions by the international community, is watching the Bitcone market with its new "" money cow. "" Fox News quoted cyber security expert Ashley Sun on July 10 (local time) as saying, "" As the price of Bitcone has soared, North Korean hackers are looking to the Bitcone exchange for financial gains. "" Sun said in an interview with Sky News in the United Kingdom, "" We recently found out that several groups of APT (continuing to attack specific targets with various hacking techniques) are seeking financial gains and have called in to the bank and the Korea Exchange on the money market. "" Sun researchers and colleagues reported hacking groups suspected of receiving support from the North Korean government, such as Lazarus, Blunorov and Aliael, and the Cyber Beat Tracking Company (ATM), and Korean banks, which conducted a money-for-cash transaction. As a result, hackers who were interested in collecting confidential data or information recently decided to use the service to obtain cyber money, such as Bitcone, the report said.Sun's research fellow said, "" We have never had such a successful cyber attack yet, "" but added, "" As a result, the group of North Koreans who tried to hack into Vitcone has become "" good investment targets. "" "" I expect them to carry out more Bitcone attacks and continue to attack banks, "" he said. "" One of the reasons that Bitcone is being attacked is because its price is constantly rising. "" A South Korean bank official, who declined to be identified, said in a news interview, "" Only a few years ago, a cyber attack was made to paralyze society but is now being analyzed for money. "" Cyber security company FireI also said in a September report that North Korea-connected hackers stole Bitcons by hacking into South Korean virtual currency exchanges at least three times since May. `` Now we may be witnessing a second wave, '' FireI said in a report. The state-sponsored actors (North Korea-connected hackers) are trying to steal Bitcones and other virtual currency as a means to obtain financial support for the regime to avoid sanctions. The Korea Internet Development Agency (KISA) also predicted more cyber attacks from North Korea on the virtual currency exchange in its 2018 forecast of a cyber attack. We could make a detour next year, said East Security director Moon Jong-hyun.

"○ Documentary rights to the word "" Kerr "" or "" Bob Mukja "" or "" Documentation of the word "" or "" Time difference "" or "" Time difference ""? Using the hottest word these days, "" Stoop, "" professional actor Sung Woo has recorded radio commercials imitating Kim's voice. The listeners are Kim Saeng-min or even close to home. Kim Saeng-min didn't appear, but Kim Saeng-min has the effect. In this case, the advertisement agency should pay Kim Saeng-min a fee or not. The promise of the commercial use of popular words, which has long been a hot topic in the gag business, is in full swing and attracts attention. Kim Dae-hee and Kim Joon-ho, who are senior members of the gag business, began protecting the fashion words as intellectual property rights on November 16 when they registered them as a trademark with the pie patent law office. A sound trademark gives a trademark to the ' sound ' used to indicate the source of the product. Other communication companies ` unique connection sounds, such as "" Jingle (short music used as brand logo), "" are registered as sound trademarks. Patent lawyer Cho Min-jung told `` The Hankyoreh > on the phone, the word is recognized as a trademark because it is associated with certain images, such as tones or accents. Sound labels have been introduced in the nation since 2012, making it the first time popular words have been registered. ■ Register first buzz word : "" Let's get it done "" or "" Bob Mukja "" or "" Whisper-ign-out, "" there are four fad words that have been registered as the current sound trademark. It is "" Kerhizana, "" by Kim Joon-ho, "" Bob Mukja "" by Kim Dae-hee, "" That's different then "" by Culto, and "" Whirina. "" "" Kerhizana "" was not like "" Gag Concert "" (2013), "" Bob Mukja "" (2004), "" I need to talk "" (2007), "" I think that's when you're smiling. "" Despite all the fashionistas that had already been swept by, Kim Joon-ho was unable to slowly identify the fad words as "" unprecedented. "" So he began to expand them as symbols for seniors. The "" narava, "" which Park installs and calls home bars along with popular words, has been registered as a text card. Commercial users of a trademark fad are required to pay a certain amount of money, and any unauthorized use of the word may impose legal sanctions on licensed comedians. Unlike copyrights, sound trademarks, each part must be registered in accordance with the classification of each product as defined in the Trademark Law, which is currently entertainment and advertising. In particular, comedians also agree that the voice actors lost heavily from commercials on radio that copy fad words. The first time registration of the new sound trademark will prevent damages to radio advertisements. "" Many times, they used fad words as voice, "" Kim said. Kim Dae-hee said, There is nothing wrong with viewers using it for fun in their daily lives. However, it can only be problematic if the companies or companies use the product illegally for commercial purposes, the official said. It is difficult to go into detail how far an infringement is allowed because there is no case, said Cho Min-jung, a patent attorney. It may take some time before the case is established, said the statement, It is meaningful in that there are sanctions against the rights and infractions of comedians. Regardless of the reality fee revenue earned from exporting fad words I've coined, comedians take great significance that they have a right to use them. All the comedians who spoke with < Hankyoreh > said, "" I'm pleased to be recognized as having my ideas answered. "" Comedians spent the whole week working on writing cocks and fad words, but could not claim any rights to the results. Many comedians ' ideas are commercially stolen from TV and radio networks, including one company's unauthorized use of the format of ' Spray-entertainment ' in ads in 2014. Most of the ads were uninterrupted in 2006 when Kim Mi-ryeo's agency complained to businesses that illegally used the fad words, "" Knight Kim, Drive Up ~ "" which was published in Culture Broadcasting Corporation, but they did not stop advertising. Even the profits from the 2015 comedy concerts > and the Chinese remake were taken away by broadcasters and comedians received no money. Korean formats were used by Chinese comedians, while Korean comedians moved to other regions to teach their skills. One comedian who participated in the remake at the time said, It was sad to see money go away and be denied any rights. Although the Korean broadcasting company said, "" Connor's broadcasting gives away all of his rights to the broadcasting company, "" even the idol audition programs share with the singer the profits of the songs they produce. As many times, the creations of valuable comedians had no rights, they were used illegally and were approved by the Korean Intellectual Property Office and are now recognized as industrial property rights on trendy words, Kim Joon-ho said. In foreign countries, it is common to register fad words as sound trademark. As the world-renowned ring announcer Michael Buffer said before the boxing match, Let's get ready to fight, "" Let's get ready to cry, "" it was announced as a trademark of a voice in 1992. The buffer reportedly earned more than $ 400 million over the past 25 years from this single line. He registered his trademark when his personal comments were used commercially without permission. The cry of an MGM movie studio was also registered, and the tone sound of coins from the Japanese game Super Mario Series was applied for as a trademark on February 10, 2016. Kim Jin-jung, director of the Korean office of Yoshimoto Heung, a famous gag agency in Japan, said, Although it is not specified by the Copyright Act, comedians were rarely used in cases of high status and business planning firms. Some say they are not only gag but also creative. There is still a lack of awareness to protect the rights of creators to use fad words. One comedian, who asked not to be named, said, "" Fashionable has to be used by many people, and when it comes time to fees, I don't think I'd want to use it at all. "" Fashionable is mostly used in radio ads, as casting out good impersonators can have a similar effect at relatively low cost. Whether legal sanctions will go in the right direction is uncertain in this country, where the value of comedians remains low, he added. Some say it is not clear who has the right to the fad words. That is because most of the fad words come from TV gag programs. One entertainment producer who produced the gag program, Fiddy, told The Hankyoreh > on the phone, "" It is often difficult for anyone to compose because the idea of a writer or other person, such as Fiddy, is often added to the completion process. "" In Japan, comedians usually appear and perform on various TV stations with their own put-ups, so it is clear that comedians have the right to ideas. Patent attorney Cho Min-jung said, Convenience words are owned by individuals because they are expressed by their unique tone of voice, accent, and tone. Broadcasters can question the influence of producers on the creative process considerably, but basically the buffs are the intellectual property of the comedians ` individuals. Even when taking into consideration such practical difficulties, many people say that comedians should recognize the rights of works they produce by their efforts. Culto once tried to get the copyright for fad words, but one sentence of the phrase was not recognized for its creativity, such as not protected by copyright laws. The introduction of the sound trademark in 2012 allowed us to recognize the value of fad words, and we are now at the beginning point. Recognizing the importance of the rights of creators, Kim Sun-young, a pop culture commentator, said, It would make comedians ` status better and Korean comedy levels better.

"There was no innovation. It is the Korean media's rhetoric every year after Apple announced its new product. This year was no different. The Korean media, which would have a strong lead over global media when it comes to subjects, even picked out the revolutionary title of iPhone X, or innovation X, in reference to the iPhone X. After Steve Jobs ' death, the media published an obituary for Apple's innovation. Of course, Apple is still the world's top smartphone market. Samsung has given up its sales volume and market share, but its sales and profit share remain at the top.The gap between the media and the mayor is still big, but it has become narrower. The higher the expectation, the greater the disappointment. The market is in favor of Apple but has narrowed it down from its competitors. Just then this year marked the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. With the start of 2017, rumors erupted as high as expected of the new iPhone. Expectations and disappointment were at a higher point than ever. It was a turning point where Apple needed to show something. Q : Has there really been any innovation? She went to Apple in 2017. Apple's year begins with rumors. Rumors fill in the void between the World Development Congress (WWDC) in June and the iPhone public event in September. Apple products are actively engaged in the task of comparing rumors with actual announcements, as if it were based on the answers to a questionnaire. The most anticipated thing is the new iPhone. The iPhone, which emerged from Steve Jobs ' blue jeans and became the heart of Apple, celebrated its 10th anniversary this year. The battle between the free agents and Apple, the spear and the shield was fought on the iPhone.Originally, it was time for the iPhone S, the iPhone 7’s performance improvement board. However, the majority of media predicted that on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, it would release a completely different ' iPhone 8. ' Earlier this year, the expected specifications of the iPhone 8 were ▲ OLEDeless design with an OLED display ▲ glass-designed lens design ▲ Glass design ▲ dual-cameras ▲ dual camera and face and gesture detection of a new 3D home sensor. The price was expected to be more than $ 1,000. Expect iPhone 8 - Source : Benjamin Geskin tweeting Your iPhone 8 - The view behind the screen on what you would expect is a little bit like home run and fingerprint recognition. As the opening of the iPhone in September approaches, a new argument was raised that the home button and fingerprint recognition would disappear. It was also suggested that the face recognition function, Faith ID, would replace the fingerprint recognition ID. In addition to the iPhone 8, the iPhone S is expected to be released. There are also indications that the official name will be the iPhone X, not the iPhone 8. The so-called "" M shaped hair loss "" design was also leaked shortly before it was officially unveiled. Fans familiar with Apple's format of announcements predicted that Apple would release its iPhone X, followed by a series of other product announcements, followed by a "" One More Thing. ""IPhone 8 Estimates (Source : Benjamin Geskin Twitter) Sirry Speakers are the most popular besides iPhones. Speakers with a voice recognition secretary, ShirI, are expected to be opened. As the AI speaker market of Amazon emerged, word emerged that Apple would soon release speakers using ShirI. Whether Sirish speakers will be able to concentrate on audio features such as Amazon's Echo Speaker and Google Home or an Amazon's Echo Show was unclear. Other stories included AR eyeglasses, new MacBook and iMac line-up, third-generation Apple Watch and 4K Apple TV.One Morewallaple announced its new software and hardware release of its new home PC series, iOS 11, in its keynote address on June 5 (local time) at the World Development Congress (WWDC) 2017. The speaker with a voice recognition secretary, ShirI, was the most popular one that day. Home Plate, once called the Shearer Speaker project, was expected to be announced at WWDC, and was right on target. Although the screen was expected to be built in, Apple focused on its speakers by featuring music as a distinction.At ' WWDC 2017 ' Philip Schlier, Senior Vice President of Marketing at Apple, announced home plate. Apple's smart speaker, home plate, is seen as the response time by ShirI, the artificial intelligence secretary on the home plate, in white and space gray.The hardware components of the | home plate, the Siri-speaking Sile-Speaker Project, and the existing AI speakers and differences of the ' home plate ' home plate were focused on music. Apple has strategically promoted music, as shown by the names of products that remind us of iPods. Rather than "" smart, "" the speaker is regarded as the only speaker with a hole. Starting late, Apple focused on the music that it could best do. The combination of an Apple designed bottom-up woofer and custom A8 chips delivers a clear, less distorted tone. It also detects the home plate's own position in the room and automatically adjusts the audio system through space recognition function. It means that the sound is optimized to fit the space by finding out whether it is on the table or in the corner. The price was set at $ 349 in the United States. It was announced for release in December, but Apple recently delayed the launch date for its home plate until early next year.The iPhone was unveiled on September 12 (local time) at the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple's New Apple Park in Cupertino, California. The names iPhone S, iPhone S Plus and iPhone 8 were originally listed as the new phones ; however, iPhone 8 was named as the official release notes before the event. First announced was the iPhone 8. The iPhone 8 follows the Apple look that has continued since the iPhone 6 without a noticeable change in its appearance. The biggest difference is that the back is turned into glass.Philip Schiller, Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing at Apple, said, "" The new generation of iPhones that we love has enhanced all of the benefits of our iPhones. "" And then Tim Cook, who led us on the iPhone 8, said it was a completely new product. And the iPhone X was released. Most of the information leaked before the event was completely new, but the fact that the home button and fingerprint recognition were really gone, and the cost of the balding design, made it seem better than it should be at $ 1,000. At the event that day, ' Apple Watch Generation 3 ' and ' Apple TV 4K ' were revealed along with the iPhone. Although the front of the product was expected to move to the rear of the product or be built into the screen, the home button ended up being a ‘ push unlocked ’ and disappeared into history. Touch-ID, a fingerprint recognition feature, went missing, too. Instead, new additions fill in the missing parts. Homburton was replaced by gestures and Touch-ID by face ID.Touch ID has been replaced by Face ID.Homberton has been the iPhone's trademark for the past 10 years. Even with many changes, Homburton remained in his seat. It was not just a symbol, but also the core of the user experience. Unlike Android, which has a number of buttons such as a back button, iPhone operation centers on touch and home button. When going back to the home screen or multitasking, one home button will do the trick. The absence of such a home button inevitably leads to changes in the user experience. Apple introduced the gesture manipulation. The home button function was implemented by sweeping the fingers up from the bottom. It is different from Android, which simply moved the operating system of the physical buttons to the software key.It has also introduced face recognition, eliminating the finger scanning that has become a reliable security tool over the years. FaceID is implemented by technology applied in the front camera ' True Depth Camera '. A gap in the display front, reminiscent of an M shape hair loss, includes a true-depth camera system that consists of a dot projector, an infrared camera, and a floodloodlock camera. More than 30,000 invisible dots are projected onto the face to create a user's face map, and an infrared camera checks the pattern of dots on the face to validate the user's identity.In fact, the face recognition security system itself is not new. However, traditional facial recognition is a method of comparing two dimensional plane images. It is like comparing the recognized face with the existing registered face with the normal front camera to determine if the face matches. As a result, it is difficult to tell whether the camera is actually intended for users or pictures. In case of face ID, the depth of face is measured literally with the true-depth camera system. Because of the contrast of three-dimensional images, the lock is released only when the user sees it, and can be used in the dark through infrared sensors. The new chipset, ' A11 Bionic, ' recognizes changes in appearance through machine running. They can recognize users by wearing glasses and a hat, by growing a beard and by changing their hairstyles.The animoticon face ID of the camera is not just a security system. True Depth camera systems use multiple methods for areas requiring three-dimensional images, with finely mapping of the face to 30,000 points. Apple, for example, came with a ' Annie Motikon. ' It is interlinked with augmented reality (AR) fields. AR, which reflects virtual images in reality, needs to realize the reality in a sophisticated way and develop virtual images without being awkward. True Depth Camera System is expected to add refinement to the AR field. Apple has been working hard to use the iPhone as an AR platform since iOS 11.This year, on its 10th anniversary, Apple unveiled its iPhone 8 and iPhone X, which have refined the previous decade into a complete form and set the future for the iPhone.

This is because it signifies the complete thaw in the relationship between the two countries, which had been frozen hard due to the so-called THAAD (High Level missile defense system) conflict. For this reason, the announcement of a joint statement on the completion of the THAAD conflict and the normalization of relations between the two countries after the summit talks could be the most effective result of the summit between the two countries.

"Introduction to the International Journal of the Astronautical Astronomical Obs of Japan and the United States The discovery of an old document titled ' Red Sky ' might have triggered an extremely large magnetic storm on the East Coast of America in 1989. The night sky in Joseon, Qing Dynasty, and Japan turned deadly red on September 10, 1770 when it provided the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This mysterious phenomenon lasted for nine days. More than 300 years have passed and disappeared from people's memories, but some literature still conveys this mysterious phenomenon vividly.Aurora phenomena recorded in SekaI, the Japanese Ancient Astronomical ObsWhen ' coronal self-discharge ' erupts as energy-powered particles explode across the sun's surface, the polar regions experience severe magnetic storms. The red night sky on record is believed to be the aurora caused by a magnetic disturbance. The size of the magnetic storm at the time was estimated to have approached a record solar flare as observed in September 1859 by British astronomer Richard Carrington. Carrington's high-energy particle reached Earth in just 18 hours, briefly crippling the U.S. and European telegraph systems. The operator was electrocuted and the telegraph system was on fire. Auroras, which used to appear only in polar regions, were also observed in the Caribbean. Called the Carrington Incident, this is considered a classic case of magnetic storms.HisashI Ōsaka University professor Hiyakawa and his team began searching through related documents that mentioned red aurora borealis in order to shed light on the mysterious phenomenon discovered in some records. The institute investigated the official records of the Qing Dynasty, the annals of the Joseon Dynasty, the diaries of Seungjeongwon, and 111 records of Japan. A review of records shows that the length of time an aurora has been observed in Northeast Asia was between September 10 and 19, 1770. According to the official records of the Qing Dynasty, 22 times were discovered that they saw the red aurora. No records were found in the writings of Seungjeongwon and the annals of the Chosun Dynasty. The researchers estimated that they could not observe astronomical phenomena due to wet weather from September 16 to 18 in Joseon.Another record was found in Europe. Relevant data were left in the record holder on the solar flares left by German astronomer Johann Kaspar and the captain James Cook, who led the expedition team to the British vessel Endeavour on the island of Southeast Asian island of Timor. This means that the aurora was observed in much lower latitudes. Corresponding to the first time an aurora has been observed simultaneously in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Auroras are often found in polar regions. The fact that they were found at such a low latitude is proof that they were active. Hayakawa said, I think the magnetic storms were very large at the time and happened not only in East Asia but also in the lower regions.The researchers also searched the sunspot records thoroughly. Often magnetic storms are closely related to sunspot shapes. Records at the time showed that the size of the sunspot was more than twice larger than that of the Carrington accident. The researchers interpreted that the size of the magnetic storms in 1770 was similar to or much larger than the Carrington accident. At that time, the aurora lasted for nine days, more than double what it did during the Carrington incident, which lasted four days.Researchers believe the Carrington incident may not be unusual anymore. Professor HiroakI Isobe of the University of Tokyo said, The large-scale magnetic storms are estimated to occur every 100 years, and should be recalculated with the frequency of strong magnetic storms.Experts predict severe damage if a strong magnetic storm occurs again. This is because they have become much more dependent on electricity. The magnetic storm of 1989 sent 6 million homes in the eastern coast of the United States into darkness. The Quebec City area in Canada was also Black out for 90 seconds. Lloyds Bank of England released a study saying it expects $ 2.6 trillion in damages if a magnetic storm the size of the Carrington accident occurs again in 2013. Researchers are looking for magnetic storms similar to the 177-year-old in historical records. Thanks to the existence of ancient documents that contain astronomical phenomena, we can track the movements of the sun for 1,000 years, Hayakawa said. Records about the aurora borealis come down everywhere. It was also found in the astronomical records of Babylon, an ancient kingdom, in 567 B.C. Researchers say they have already found another magnetic storm of similar size.kunta@hankyung.com[ Hankyung dotcom the press bakkeuntae ] to go to [a private school for Chinese classics] [Korea mobile subscription.] © 5 Kits combine the Korean economy and president Im Jong-seok redistribution of the ban and unauthorized war damage and com hankyung.(local time) the chief of staff for the 10th unit visited the arc the United Arab Emirates (uae) Moon Jae-in and encouraged by the president a watch as a gift. / = picture of Cheong Wa Dae Moon Jae-in as a special envoy of the president visited the United Arab Emirates (uae), Im Jong-seok, chief of the past 10 days (local time) arc to meet servicemen.Encouraged, Cheong Wa Dae on May 11.

"People appear to be watching the redevelopment of Cat Mom, a cat-mongering apartment with stray cats that have left behind in Kim Ha-yeon's unquestioning pot-restoration project. What is the blunt eye? Inside a redevelopment apartment complex, blocked by a three-story steel fence, people have left, and a street walker remains. One or two rooms per week disappear, creating an open space the size of an elementary school playground. The scene changes. The land that must be kept is crumbling, and the spaces that can be hidden or rested are not allowed to be kept by the senior citizens. There is nothing to eat. There is less waste that people throw away, and the mice have left. There are a few people who enter an apartment every day for such a senior. Regardless of who knows, they are the only ones who want to save their children. They are still going into the apartment late this afternoon as friends. She makes her house with styrofoam in the cafeteria next to the open space, which is covered with scrap metal. A wound the size of a grain of rice on nasal dot had become swollen by the size of a chestnut in a day. If you can't come near a child, you should carefully clean him or her. The wound is too deep and severe. That night, she rescued a tux and treated it at the hospital. After distributing more than 20 kilograms of feed, dozens of cans and water to my cats. The only place that the tux can go after treatment is apartments again. All they can do here is to let the president and the construction company worry about getting them through under the wall. And all the three cat moms who take care of these children can do is give them rice. I have to eat myself out of it all. Cat moms, who used to have one or two friends each time, left without a hitch in the last two weeks. There has been no consideration for road warriors in the large-scale construction projects of redevelopment or reconstruction. I took it for granted that I wasn't there again. The proprieties of the past are becoming more and more uncomfortable for us. When people walk in, the ' nudge ' in front of the mall in the middle of the complex moves. At a very slow speed, he watches like a statue from the road leading through. When eating, share your meal with the magpies and give cans to give a concession to the shy and shy ' lightning '. When the sun goes down, the apartment complex is completely devoid of streetlights and darkness falls. He sat closely watching as Cat's moms turned to flashlights to fill more than 20 feeding and feeding halls with rice and water. When I rescue my tuxedo, I looked so far away. Why is a blunt instrument? Just because I miss someone, thank Bob, or an instinctive mind to be territorial? But the blunt eye is telling me a different story. It seems as if they're asking what they're going to do with us, and if it's okay to disappear. It's our turn to answer. Is it right to establish a place for people's new lives over the death of the creatures on the road? There isn't much time left. The apartment building is collapsing again today.

The ministry estimates many of them quit their jobs to take care of their elementary school children. In February and March each year, the number of cases in which women with lower grades lose their health insurance coverage is much higher than in other months. Last year, among women with elementary school children, 61,833 lost their health insurance licenses due to retirement, with 8,800 in March and 7,870 in February. It is well above the monthly average of 5798. Given the weak after-school care system, young women are being forced to quit their jobs. That is why some point out that efforts to solve the career break of young women need to strengthen the after-school care system. Working mothers with lower grades in elementary school often find it hard to get a job as they worry about their children after school, said Kim Seon-young, 35, an alias.

"[2007-2006 closing ②] Many changes have occurred in the Korean automobile industry this year, with the arrival of electric cars at 383 kilometers (Jidinet Korea = Cho Jae-hwan).Tesla's entry into the market has intensified the competition for electric cars and ignited the competition for the development of battery and other related technologies. Domestic carmakers and importers in particular advanced their ADAS (Advanced Driving Assist) technology such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Maintenance Assist (LKAS), respectively, while driving along the road with the cars.With Greeniet Korea's & apos ; 2017 balance of payments and applications ;, it hopes to look back on the Issus and trends in the auto industry this year and look forward to the market and new technology next year.< Loading order > 1.Budding vehicles 2. Opening of Long-Range Electric Cars : EV-Transportation & Apos ; Super Long-Directional Electric Boundations ; Grandeur Inspects a Long Run From Last Year to Super Long-Terror A medium size electric car that can go up to 191 kilometers on a single charge. The figures are a combination of urban and motorway driving, allowing drivers to drive more than 200 kilometers in the city center.However, the figure did not satisfy all of the owners of the backup electric cars. Drivers who drove mainly for long distances wanted an electric car that could run for at least 300 kilometers.Their wishes were realized earlier this year. This is because the company has already entered the country with electric cars that can drive long distances, such as Chevrolet Volt EV and Tesla model S.Bolt EV started selling here last October when the Jeju International Train Expo was held in March of this year after it first unveiled in COEX, Samseong-dong, Seoul, in 2016. Bolt EV mileage has been certified to 386km (based on domestic measurements), double the combined mileage of Ionik Electric.The distance of 383 kilometers is enough to make one way between Seoul Station and Mount Toll. Enjoy driving with fuel economy and reduce the actuation of the air conditioning system for driving over 400 km.Bolt EV (Photo : GM Korea) Bolt was evaluated to have opened up in the era of long-distance electric cars, but only sold a few hundred. The contract, which was made by any order, drew complaints from some prospective owners.GM Korea plans to send out an apology letter and secure up to 6,000 units of sales of Volt EVs starting next year, leading the era of long-distance electric cars.Tesla model S was also one of the most popular models in the domestic electric car market, along with Bolt EVs.Tesla Korea opened stores in Cheongdam-dong, Seoul, and at Starfield Hanam Shopping Center in Hanam, Gyeonggi Province, and began selling model S in June. Initially only 90D trims were sold, but now 75D and 103D trims are also available.Model S990D has been certified for distances of 378 kilometers in Korea, 75D for 360 kilometers, and 456km for 100 D. As of December this year, Tesla's model S10-D has become the longest-running electric car in Korea.Tesla Model S93D (photo = Jidinet Korea) Tesla Korea's sales in Korea are expected to increase by the end of the year. According to data from the Korea Kaizu Data Institute, the Tesla model S registered 122 during the January-December period. About 110 units were registered from June to November, the deadline for Korea`s dual-model S.According to the industry forecast, the number of model S cars in Korea will reach 200 by December this year. Tesla Korea plans to expand its fast charger and slow charger to accommodate the growing number of customer vehicles. The company aims to increase the total number of charging stations in the nation to 175 by next year, including 25 supercharger charging stations.At the Daegu International Future Automotive Expo last month, Renault Samsung Motors unveiled its 2018 SM3 ZERO model, which reaches a maximum of 213 kilometers after being charged. The contract is for Ionik Electric to give up its long drive electric car title less than a year after it was released here.Hyundai Kia Motors and Hyundai Kia Motors could not beat Ionik Electric Company, which are in crisis. Kia Motors Corp. unveiled its 2018 Soul EV that improved driving distance when it opened the Jeju International Train Expo, but did not have much influence on the domestic electric car market. Hyundai Motor also focused on selling Ionik Electric.Instead, the company unveiled its master plan for future electric cars in Yeouido on Aug. 17. Because of the threat posed by other brands ' aggressive attack on long-distance electric cars, it appears that they have set up a separate venue for their announcements.Hyundai Kia Motors Corp.`s master plan for electric cars is divided into two major plans. One is the Genesis brand electric car, with a nose or EV that can drive up to 390 kilometers on a single charge and a 500 or more.Cona EV`s photo "" Gidinet Korea "" or "" EV""is waiting to be charged, is currently being tested for finishing roads around the metropolitan area such as Uiwang, Gyeonggi Province. In addition, it is preparing to make a comfortable charging process, such as conducting a test of a public rapid charger installed in Korea. If the Cornas or EVs get more than 390 kilometers from the government, they will likely have sufficient competition, including Bolt EVs.Kia Motors Corp. unveiled its plan to release Niro EVs, which can run for up to 380 kilometers on a single charge, during a recent quarterly conference call. Niro EV is expected to have the title of the Family SUV electric car based on a wheelbase longer than Tilblet.Corna EVs and Niro EVs are scheduled to be released in the first or second half of next year. When the two electric cars are released next year, the rivalry for long-range electric cars is likely to be stronger than this year.The forecast for the Genesis electric car is in 2020 or 2021. It is expected that it will be produced at the G8 level, and the specific performance and specifications are not yet known.Jojae-hwan, journalist Cho, please subscribe to Jidinet Korea from Naver channel (jaehwan.cho@zdnet.co.kr)"

A good jujube has a light wrinkled, red-skinned face and a yellowish brown skin on the inner layer.◇ If the temperature of the head drops, which helps reduce blood pressure, the blood pressure increases. If exposed to cold air suddenly, blood vessels shrink rapidly. If you usually have high blood pressure, you should drink tea with two eyes to control your blood pressure. According to Chinese book, [Chinese extensive dictionary], 119 patients with hypertension were given one to two months of consumption for treatment, and 43 % (51) answered that they were satisfied with the treatment. A U.S. journal on chemistry reported that when the skin of the tapeworm was fed to patients with hypertension by tea or alcohol, 94 % of the patients had an improvement in hypertension after two to four months.- Put 50g of duchung in 1L of the ingredients and boil it for 30 minutes on a high heat and simmer it for two hours or so. Then, remove the dried fish, cool the soup, and keep it in the refrigerator, and then share it three to five times a day.◇ If you are suffering from a sore throat, try drinking balloon flower root tea. According to Donguibogam, balloon flower roots have a strong effect on phlegm farming (e.g., the removal of phlegm and the extraction of phlegm), resulting in coughs caused by colds, sore throat, and difficulty in breathing. In fact, the balloon flower roots contain a great deal of saponin, which is used to make the mucous membrane that moisturizes the bronchial tubes. Sufficient and robust bronchI membranes can protect the throat from incoming pathogens. It also helps prevent cardiovascular diseases. Balloon roots contain a lot of something called inulin, which lowers cholesterol and keeps glucose at a certain level. There are also high levels of sterol that prevent bad body absorption of LDL-cholesterol and produce an effect on the body to expel cholesterol. Another study by Konkuk University said it can create a blood pressure medication with high calcium channel insulation ability by adding a substance called vetuline that has been isolated from balloon flower roots.- Put 30g of dried balloon flower roots in 1L of the article that makes balloon flower root tea and boil them over high heat for 30 minutes. When it starts to boil, reduce the heat to a simmer. You can take the impurities out on a sieve and drink it. You can add honey.◇ Arthritic patients experience severe pain as blood circulation in their knee joints is not smooth and muscles surrounding them become clustered when the temperature of the Ogacha difference decreases. In such cases, it is recommended to drink OgapI tea to help ease arthritis. OgafI includes Eleudoside, an anti-inflammatory drug, and phenolphthaleine, which reduces rheumatoid arthritis, and anti-oxidation effects. Kyung Hee University studies say OgafI has a cure for rheumatoid arthritis. OgafI also increases the vitality of cartilage cells, increasing the density of bone minerals, according to research by the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine. Donguibogam also introduces OgapI to help strengthen the tendon and bone, and to relieve bone pain and weakness.- Put 15g of dried orgaf stem in 1L of the ingredients and boil it for two and a half hours. As it is bitter, you can boil jujubes or licorice together or add honey./ Lee Bo-ram, Chosun Ilbo reporter, Who are 590 of the nation's top names?▶ The strongest cold snap in the winter has begun.Heavy snow is also forecast in Honam and West Coast areas, and we will learn more about the weather.

The Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education announced on July 11 that it recently held a disciplinary committee to dismiss the teachers at Yeoju A High School and Han (42).Yonhap news photographer was recently sentenced to two years in jail at the first trial on charges of violating sex protection laws for children and teens. We have also decided to fire as social unrest has been aroused due to the cheating by Kim and as education authorities have harshly ruled on sex abuse teachers with the One-Trick Out system, an official at the education office said. According to the Rules on Disciplinary Measures for Education Officials Act, the minimum level of disciplinary measures against education officials who have violated sex and sexual harassment against minors and disabled people was dismissed. Kim and Han will be deprived of their official status due to the dismissal process and will be limited to government jobs for the next five years. A teacher who did not take any action after hearing that her students were sexually harassed by the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education was reprimanded by the teachers. The current law requires teachers to report any gender damages to the school superintendent immediately when they learn it from their students, and the school superintendent should report it to police. Unconscious warnings are for reprimands, but they are not disciplinary actions against the government for having made a public appeal or for a fault caused during the process of sincere or active work. The education office said it was impressed by the past achievements of C. Kim, who was the director of the department for human rights and safety, accused one of molesting 13 female students and accusing the other of assault, and asked for a physical massage on 13 students. Han, who served as a homeroom teacher in the third grade from March 2015 until June last year, was indicted on charges of touching the hips of 54 female students who encountered her while walking down the halls. you@yna.co.kr"
"The thickness of the hexagonal structure composed of carbon atoms is 0.2 ㎚ transparent, but the technology of the research center can be stronger than iron and generate tens of thousands of times more electricity in the same area ; Graphen Bowl is said to increase battery capacity and make charging faster five times. Lithium-ion batteries are used in many locations, including smartphones, laptops, and electric cars, but they are difficult to add capacity and have a slower charge. And that's what Graphene did.Graphene, who has been called the "" dream new material "" since the mid-2000s, is entering the commercial phase of every industry segment, including battery, semiconductors, construction materials and automotive materials, after long research. According to market researcher Zion Market Research, the global grappiness market is forecast to grow at an annual rate of 35 % over the next seven years from a mere $ 32 million in 2016. When Andre Feodine, the first professor of physics at the University of Manchester in Britain, won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2004, the academic world said, "" It looks like it's possible to write an infinite thing. "" And that's really starting to turn out like this.◇ World's thinnest and hardest substance … the physical and chemical properties of a graphene are thin carbon membranes with only one layer of graphite that have been stripped of soft pencil lead material. If you look at the electron microscope, it's a honeycomb, which is a hexagonal carbon atom. Professor Fertilla Novocelov succeeded in producing the grapin by repeatedly attaching and cutting cellophane to the block of graphite. Graphene is called the dream's new material because its physical-chemical properties are superior to those of other materials.First, the thickness of the graphene is 0.2 nanometers (1 ㎚ = one billionth of a meter), so it passes out 98 % of light. That means you can create clear displays by using grappins to make components like electrodes and light emitting device. So, it's very thin, but structurally, it's very stable. It's 100 times stronger than steel, and flexible enough to keep 20 % of the area afloat. It's 100 times more efficient than copper that you can use as an electrical wire. Compared to silicon as a semiconductor material, you can deliver electrons 100 times faster. Graphene immediately emerged from the scene and pushed the emerging materials of the new Fullerene or Carbon Nanotube to the forefront. Companies and scientists have also created processes that allow mass production.◇ How do you make it?… Graphene Flake and CVD Graphene Graphene are divided by how they are created, by the type of Graphene Flake and CVD chemistry. It depends on how you build it. Graphene flakes make graphite by separating using strong acids or reducing agents. Mass production is also possible with ball-mill processes that break graphite with steel tools. Graphen Flakes are used in a wide range of applications, including composite materials, radiator material and ink for printing electromagnetic shields. In China, where mass production is established, it makes one kilogram of green fin flakes at about 200,000 won.CVD graphene production was developed in 2009 by Professor Hong Byung-hee of Seoul National University. It is the method of burning gas containing carbon, such as methane, at high temperatures and leaving only carbon on the metal surface. This gives you a larger size graphene, much better than the graphene flakes. As a result, CVD grappin can be used as a high value added material such as displays, clear electrodes and semiconductors. Korea first developed CVD Graphene, and technically, it is globally competitive.Graphene utilization is currently focused on Graphene Flake. Mix and make a building material that's stronger than traditional architecture and fire proof. And with ink or paint made from graphite, you can coat metal to prevent oxidation of the metal and maintain electrical conductivity. Conventional metal coatings can reduce electrical conductivity, whereas green fin flakes do not have problems at all. Graphene has also been used in energy electrodes and heat and electromagnetic shielding material. Graphene Bowl, published by the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, is another such effort. Graphene has a high thermal and electrical properties, so it can also be used as a shielding membrane to protect automotive electrical parts and more. Car companies are testing a graphine-shielding membrane that delivers better performance and durability than the aluminum shield we use today.For high-quality CVD Graphens, technologies are still being developed that produce them in volume at lower cost. Even though it's expensive, some fields are used because they're so good. CVD Graphene provides a membrane that maintains moisture and oxygen to extend the life of an organic light diode (OLED) display.◇ Government led by the government and other governments around the world that have been promoting the green fin industry are pouring huge sums into Graphene research and commercialization. Korea spends 210 billion won on commercial component parts development projects in Graphene, and the EU spends about 128 billion won on commercial research and development in Grappin over 10 years. The U.K. government has invested ￡ 60 million in Grappin Research Center at Manchester University, and Singapore has invested 100 billion won in Graphene over the past five years.The leading factor in this field is unexpectedly China. China is actively utilizing the fact that it is the richest country in the world with graphite. As of 2015, China's graphite production was overwhelming with an annual output of 8.6 billion tons. It's 67.7 percent of the world's graphite production. Judging from its abundance of graphene material, the Chinese government quickly invested in the production of green fin flakes, and fostered businesses. As a result, as of 2016, there are more than 400 Graphene companies in China. It's 75 % of the global graphene industry. Chinese companies produce not only the production and processing of green pins, but also the construction materials, fabrics, battery materials, and more.Korean scientists and businesses are working to develop high value-added technologies, including CVD Graphene. Especially, if the next-generation semiconductor or electric car battery, which is one of the most popular technologies in the world, develops a source technology using green fin, this technology will help us become a new material powerhouse.[Baek Jong-beom, Director of the Department of Energy and Chemical Engineering at Ulsan Research Institute] [Go straight to Jungsan.com.] - Works magazine & chosun com, "" No unauthorized reproduction and redistribution "" - "" Small business conglomerate Ryu Seong-moo, a reporter at Yonhap News Agency 2017.12.11psykims@yna.co.kr( and the head of Fair Trade Commission Kim Sang-jo stated on July 11, "" The spread of the "" pack "" culture throughout the Korean industry is due to the small domestic market. Chairman Kim told reporters before a meeting with industry officials at the Daegu Chamber of Commerce and Industry, It is not fair or fair to say that the industry has not completely deteriorated the culture of the pack, but it is also not fair and strict in enforcing the market. Domestic domestic market is saturated with two or three large companies worth $ 1.5 trillion, he said, referring to the problem of market structure, saying, As a result of this, it is likely to become exclusively structured between large and small businesses. To overcome this, we need efforts for small and midsize companies to diversify their business lines independently and secure export lines. We will prepare and announce a comprehensive plan to strike and strike back at the commission later this month, Kim said. We will also announce comprehensive measures at the pan-government level early next year in consultation with the Small and Medium Business Ministry, the official said. Regarding the minimum wage hikes and shorter working hours, Kim said, I will try to resolve unfair business practices, but the government will also consider the issue as a result of its reform efforts. After meeting with 13 representatives of machinery and metal manufacturers in Daegu, North Gyeongsang Province, he explained measures to eradicate technological usefulness at large corporations, operate an anonymous tip center, and improve sub-contractors limiting payment of subsidised funds. In the afternoon, the Fair Trade Office in Busan will hold a meeting with eight representatives of manufacturers of shipbuilding machines and materials in Busan. tjdan@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"A painting left behind by Isaac Newton (1642-1727), a British physicist, astronomer and mathematician, was discovered.Recently, local media including BBC News reported that they had drawn a windmill on the wall next to the fireplace of Newton's birthplace of Woolsthorpe Manor in Lincolnshire, eastern England.The Wolshoff Beauty, Newton's birthplace, is a place of great scientific significance. Because there is an apple tree in the backyard that inspired the law of universal gravitation. Woollsoff Beauty, long preserved and now a tourist destination, is currently managed by Britain's National Trust, a natural and private conservation group.Newton was born in this house in 1642 and spent his childhood here. According to historical data, while living in this house, Newton left many pictures of animals, people, mathematical symbols, figures, and so on in charcoal on walls and roofs. Of course, it is just a "" doodle "" painted at an early age, but its historical value is different because it is Newton.It wasn't until 350 years ago that pictures of Newton were discovered that they were not immediately visible because of their age. This time, scientists at Nottingham Trent University used a imaging technique called Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) to identify Newton's hidden painting. RTI is a new reading technique that uses artificial lighting to make shadows and to photograph the shape of embedded letters.Dr. Chris Pick-up, who conducted the study, said, "" Using RTI technology to find more signs of Newton on Wooldspix, "" adding, "" It is very important to note that large scientists at the time understood Newton. ""Park Jong-ik, reporter of The World of Fun pji@seoul.co.kr Give me half of it back. "" A man called the Korean Women's Union Sexual Violence Advisory Service recently and demanded a refund. The counselor immediately recognized the man. "" Most of the small funds were given regularly by anonymous donors, who made a lot of fuss over 9 million won at a time. "" "" I was grateful at the time, and I didn't want to ask the bank to let me know. "" When the counselor asked her why she asked for a refund, the man hesitated for a long time and confessed. When her son was sentenced to jail on charges of indecent assault, she followed the advice of her lawyer to donate to the women's group to reduce the sentence. The man even owed money at the bank, but the sentence was not reduced as much as he thought. The consultation center returned 4.5 million won. More and more offenders and their families, who face the risk of being tried and punished for sexual harassment, are making "" exculpatory "" donations to get justice in court. After making a large donation to the sexual violence counseling center or the victims ` support group for the past few months, I regret it, and ask the court to submit a donation receipt. According to the National Council for Sexual Violence and Relations, 101 counseling centers across the nation confirmed that the gifts of offenders were donated from last year to September. The "" Yamchee "" donors stopped giving as soon as they reached their goal, including a reduction of the sentence. The skirts of women by the mobile phone in the subway in his 30s who secretly arrested for shooting a civil servant, Mr. a Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center to the receipt that the 500,000 won funding for five months.Submitted to the court. In the first trial, he decided to suspend the sentence and decided to resign. The court judged that the sponsorship of the group was a sign of remorse, and gave the court a one-sentence suspension of judgment to the ruling. In many cases, women's groups are asked to refund their support. One million won in Korea Sexual Violence Relief Center late last year sponsored the abruptly demanded her money back to the clinic a few months ago. Mr. b When the counselor asked whether you or your family were being tried on sexual violence, B asked, Why did you ask that? What's wrong with me asking for my money back. Pay whatever you want. People are also told that they donated because of improper intentions and are rejected. They demand that they stop donating large sums at a time or as soon as they contribute the gift receipts, which are issued en masse at the end of the year. If the donors are found to have been involved in sexual violence trials, they don`t receive the donations themselves or they return the gifts immediately, an official at the center explained. In some cases, women's groups tried to refund the money to the perpetrators for this reason, but reported the donation to the court and forced it to be returned. The sexual assault offenders are trying to donate black because the courts are taking donations from women's groups into consideration. Their rulings indicate ' I have seriously considered paying the donors to women's groups '. It will be difficult to distinguish sincerity because the donation receipts only show the total amount without a payment period, said an official at the center. Some lawyers advise clients involved in sexual violence to donate to women groups as a strategy to reduce sexual violence. We have frequently received a reduction in the sentence by submitting it to the court, a lawyer said. Women's groups are trying to stop the exoneration but are powerless. If the donation is distributed in small denominations or if donors turn in their donations to the court without notifying the group, it is hard to know whether they are involved in sexual violence. The court should not recognize the donation by the offenders as a way to avoid punishment, said Lee Mi-kyung, director of the Korean sexual violence counseling center.Kim Dong-hyeok, reporter hack@donga.com"
