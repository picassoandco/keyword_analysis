"" Regarding the situation, the North Korean military headquarters said, "" The weather was less than 100 meters due to the fog when the North Korean defectors were discovered, so the North Korean military headquarters should check for soldiers on the border. "" We saw the MDL approach and alerted the broadcasting company to fire 20 K-3 machine guns at 9:24 a.m., the official said. "" The search team did not approach, and at around 10:13 and 16 minutes I heard the enemy direction with a rifle call, "" he said. "" But after the shooting, neither our military guard nor our area was evacuated. "" The North Korean army that defected on that day carries an AK rifle and is investigating motives for defection, the JCS announced. According to the JCS office, the number of defectors in the North has exceeded 15 in a total of nine occasions this year, among whom four soldiers have defected in four separate occasions. Meanwhile, the military authorities announced that North Koreans again crossed over to the South on July 20, the night before.

The South Korean military secured safe defectors and the authorities will investigate the motive and circumstances of the defection, a JCS official said, adding, It was not foggy at that time. Meanwhile, the South Korean military detected a North Korean color team approaching the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) at 9:24 a.m. after securing North Korean soldiers who defected from the South, and carried out a warning broadcast and warning fire. Seeing North Korea`s military search life approaching the MDL, a military spokesman warned us at 9:24 a.m. and cautioned us against more than 20 K-3 machine guns ().

We approached the MDL line on whether the MDL violated or not, a JCS official said. ksj87@newsis.com> Official Statement "" The possibility of an unexpected power failure in the event of an aging battery "" The iPhone 6, iPhone SE and others pointed out that "" If the iPhone 6 and other parts of the answer aren't as fast as possible, there is no need for an open supply of information. "" Apple admitted to a suspicion that it intentionally reduced its performance when the iPhone was aging. However, he explained that the reason was to prevent the iPhone from being accidentally turned off. Some point out that for Apple to explain it to Apple, it should have provided the information to iPhone users transparently. Apple on July 20 (local time) stated in an official statement that "" the lithium ion batteries in the iPhone did not seem to have any disruptions to its power supply when it was low or when the temperature was low, "" which explains the iPhone. The software update that Apple refers to here is interpreted as a reduction in the performance of the ' application processor (AP) ' that corresponds to that of the smart phone's brain when the battery ages. The AP works across the smartphone, including the speed of communication, and the time it takes from instructions to reactions. That is, when the software update is performed on an iPhone, users can experience inconveniences in all areas, from using the Internet to opening up and closing the application to entering text messages. "" There has been an update to the speed lag software for iPhone 6, iPhone 6Gb/s and iPhone SE and iOS 11.2, "" Apple said, adding "" in the future. "" Suspicions that Apple intentionally blocked the performance of older iPhones were first raised on the social news website Reddit on July 9. Seegebench founder John Poold then went on to benchmark and concluded that "" When the iPhone is slow, it is better to replace the battery than the iPhone. ""Apple's statement revealed such suspicions to be true, prompting Apple to make a necessary replacement of the iPhone. The virus seems to have become a way to support the suspicion that Apple had intentionally slowed down to induce the purchase of a new iPhone, the U.S. IT media said, concerning how Apple communicates with consumers. It would not have been such a big deal if consumers had been informed ahead of time and proceeded with consent.TechCrunch also said, "" If Apple was struggling with the problem of losing battery life, it needed to communicate with the users who were using the actual device. ""Lim On-yu, a reporter at Yang Nak-kyu's "" Military Story "" ioy@asiae.co.krABC News announced on July 16 that it delivered the "" Clark Incounter Cafe, "" a 14-year gift from the U.S. company Bellevue, and Dwayne Cafe. He runs Silver Town in this area.Clark, who frequently visits the restaurant, ordered brunch on this day, as usual, including egg and bacon.The meal cost 39.6 dollars (about 40,000 won). But Clark's tip was $ 3,000, just over it.After eating, Clark wrote a note behind the bill, "" You're the best. When I was seven, I wanted my mom to cook this food. But my family was very poor and didn't have enough money to enjoy Christmas. I hope all of you have a happy Christmas with that money. "" Clark gently left a tip and receipt for Julie Wilson (42), the employee she was on today.But it was such a busy lunch time that Julie did not notice his gift. Rather, they thought someone had made a mistake because of too many tips, but they found the letter later.When the restaurant contacted the credit card company and tracked the gift, they learned that it was usually Clark. "" I shed tears at the office after reading the letter, "" Julie said.Restaurant owner Melanie Bard said, "" Clark is our good customer, "" adding, "" The gifts he gave are shared by 12 employees alike. ""`` I wanted to do something for my mother, who died during the Christmas season, '' Clark said.

"[Graphic] Top 10 jobless people out of the total 1 year since they left the company were found unemployed. ▽ Cold wave in the job market is rising not only for new job seekers but also for those who are reemployed. According to the National Statistical Office yesterday, 180,000 were found out of work last month for more than six months, an increase of 8,000 from 172,000 a year ago. The photo shows job seekers out of job counseling at the Employment Information Center in Gwangjing-gu, Seoul, on July 16. Statistics Korea said yesterday that it ' found an estimated 30.26 percent of the unemployed last month, or 874,000, out of total jobless people, were jobless before job opportunities. ' It is the first time that the proportion of those who experienced such jobs before one year have entered the 30-percent range since June 1999 when statistics were compiled. The number of people who experienced job searching after one year who stayed in the 10 % range surpassed 20 % after the global financial crisis in 2008 and rose to the second half of the 20 % after the 2012 European fiscal crisis. In recent years, he has been hovering around 25 percent but jumped to 26.1 percent and 27.8 percent in September and October before jumping last month. The percentage of those who have quit their jobs within a year was 91.5 percent, down 0.6 percentage points from 92.1 percent.▽ Social Studies first year reporter Han Sang-kyoon (Yonhap news agency) = Students prepare for a job interview at the "" Financial Cooperative Employment Fair "" held at Dongdaemun DDP Monday morning. The number of unemployed people with work experience is decreasing in comparison to those who have had their jobs at xyz@yna.co.kr however, this means that only the number of jobless people who have been out of the company for a long time is growing faster. This is interpreted as the worsening situation in the re-employment market as well as in the new job market, focusing on young people in their 20s. Some analyze that the increase in the number of employees who experienced work experience over a year ago is due to the effect of hiring more local officials based on the revised work schedule. The economically inactive population, who was ready to leave the company last year, has become mostly unemployed due to increased opportunities to hire government employees this year. Students preparing for work are classified as non-economic activity and therefore are exempt from the total number of unemployed. In fact, the number of students preparing for work last month decreased by about 31,000 to 637,000 due to the effects of the civil service examination last November. ▽ The employment market has not improved and more people can not work for a long time, said an official at the Busan Regional Public Service Office. In the same day, 62 laboratories in 16 cities and provinces excluding Seoul will have written tests for civil servants with tier 7 local government officials, 9 technical staff, and 9 technical high school. 2017.9.23 handbrother@yna.co.krrock@yna.co.kr Click on the tip of articles and inquiry (!) ▶ Group of four North Korean soldiers on the latest trend of gathering trends (Click!)

The defection came 38 days after Oh was shot by a South Korean soldier to the Joint Security Area in Panmunjeom on July 13. The South Korean military secured the defectors safely and the related agencies will investigate the motives and circumstances of the defection, the JCS explained.According to the JCS, the Korean military identified the defectors with GP guard and surveillance equipment, and the weather conditions at the time were not corrected with dense fog. There is no particular trend in the area in front of the North Korean military before or after the defection, a JCS official added. This year, the number of North Korean soldiers who defected from the South four times, and when combined with the North Koreans, it reached 15 times.

During the first evacuation from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on July 18, warning bells and whistles for a Chinese fishing boat remained stationary. The Coast Guard decided it would be difficult to approach the Chinese fishing boats because of the weather, and fired shells and shells. However, it appeared that the Chinese fishing boats, who seemed to be stepping down, again repeatedly turned off their lights at dawn on July 19 and went back to the NPT.The Korea Coast Guard began its withdrawal of the second Chinese fishing boat from Korea at 9 a.m. on July 19. Among the 44 double fishing boats, 22 were forced from all around to head for Coast Guard patrol ships. Among them, four were wrapped around the 158-man ship and two to three were close by 10 meters to the stern. At 9:12 a.m., the crew of the 158-kilometer vessel began preparing to launch the 12-gauge, non-testing weapon called rubber bullets. The vessel has reached approximately 100 m in length, and must be at least 200 m apart from other vessels to maintain a safe distance, and it is considered a dangerous situation, although the distance within 100 m has been narrowed. The runner fired a 12-gauge shot from 9:15 a.m. and then 10 minutes later, he started shooting K2 in his stern. The operation was carried out until 10:30 a.m., but after the Chinese fishing boats failed to fully resign, the operation began again from 1:00 p.m. on that day. In the morning, he fired 55 machines of the M-6 machine gun, which is a shared weapon, and 125 in the afternoon, he drove 44 Chinese fishing boats out of the NPT.

As Seo awkwardly smiled and tried to pass, the crowd of men smiled, whistled at her and followed her for about 30 seconds. Frightened Seo got out of there. Office worker Lee (25) had a similar experience. Last July while walking around Itaewon station, Lee heard the word "" appearance compliment "" twice from a group of different men. One group of men made a pass at Lee in English with his short skirt "" Nice, "" while another man shouted in clumsy Korean, "" Nice legs. "" Lee ignored him but said, It was not a pleasant feeling. Recently, more and more foreign men have been complaining about the "" catcalling "" sexual harassment they say to women who pass by on the street in Itaewon, Seoul. Catkoling is a sexual harassment that congratulates or stares outright at the look of a woman walking by. Sexual harassment is a social problem abroad, but many times women may have been sexually abused due to their unpopularity in Korea. A graphic novel titled "" The Crocodile Project "" (2016) depicting the sexual violence and sexual discrimination that women routinely experience. Recently, the stories of cat collar ups are appearing on social networking sites, which frequently provide green knowledge at year-end meetings. Netizens wrote in groups, "" Men from various countries in Itaewon "" and "" I walked through Itaewon to get to Noksapyeong-gil, and the foreign men were also irritated with my work. "" While Western countries have begun to form specific moves to regulate cat-colling, the punishment rules are still vague here. Under Article 3 section 41 of the Minor Offense Law, continuous attempts or monitoring of access against the other party's will could be punished with fines of 100,000 won or less, confinement or fines. However, Catkoling harassment is often at an "" unpleasant but even reporting level, "" so it is not even reported. It is also true that there is no way to prove sexual harassment when it is committed. We rarely receive reports of verbal sexual harassment or go to the extent of punishment, explained an official at the Yongsan Police Station in charge of women's youth education. French Shi'ite minister for gender equality, Marlene Chiah, said in October that she is preparing a bill to punish Katkoling for its planned voting next year. ShI'ites ' minister repeatedly called in a punishable cat-ringing : ' a stranger suddenly approaching a woman's face of 10 to 20 cm, ' ' a threat to the streets, ' and ' an answer to the question. ' In Belgium, the street ban on sexual harassment was passed in 2014, and Portugal and Peru have also established related laws. I want you to be my best friend in the Hankyoreh!

"Shandong yeoyuguk, travel agency in their country on January 20 meetings ""There is no deadline and the reimposition of Jan. 1."" president return to the end all three days after approval from Beijing is 19.Dong-dong feet don't mean the Chinese government, retrograde step improvement of blockade again in three weeks a group tour to Korea when China resumed for a while and that each notified to the travel agency.It was confirmed. (front page, December 20, JoongAng Ilbo. Shandong Province announced on July 20 that it had been notified by regional travel agencies such as Qingdao and Yantai, "" and held a conference on the first day of next year. It is known that the ban is not specified and will continue until further notice. Some regions, such as the Weihai, are scheduled to hold meetings on July 21, and some regions have announced such policies orally. Tourists enjoy shopping at Shinsegae Duty Free Store in Seoul Friday afternoon, while the Chinese government is allowed to visit Korea for group tours. Lim Hyun-dong, a journalist at the Beijing Women's Bureau of Foreign Affairs, / 20171205, has not already received any applications to approve collective tours from travel agencies since July 19. Some travel agencies were refused approval on July 19 and Beijing officials notified local travel agencies of their refusal to accept collective visas. China had previously banned all sales of collective tours to South Korea since March 15 in retaliation against its high-altitude missile defense system, but released them to Beijing and Shandong Province from July 28. However, it was not even a month before the government was able to collect the money. In addition, a disruption is beginning to take effect on July 19 when they only held a summit after five days of forceps and a Moon Jae-in president return home only three days. The summit will help solve the THAAD retaliation measure, said the government, which was announced in contrast to the statement that promoted the results of the visit. A travel worker in Beijing said, The atmosphere in the foreign countries is just as serious as it was when we started banning them altogether in March. The state-run youth travel agency cancelled Korean products on sale in January and deleted them from its Web site. Starting January 4, we were to prepare to resume group tours to Korea, but we were forced to cancel, said an official at the youth travel agency. In addition, the Korean and Chinese cultures ' Association of Korea and China (Chairman Lee Jong-gul) organized promotional campaigns against Chinese travel agencies and recruited 150 participants on July 30, but the first day of the tour was postponed. The problem is that the background of the measures and the intentions of the Chinese authorities have yet to be understood. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Fisheries did not give a reason to individual travel agencies that were refused to approve the tours. It is not clear how long it will last. The Chinese Embassy is analyzing the measure as a possible sign of an all-out restoration team and a possibility that it will allow part of the tours to Korea but adjust the payment of funds. We don`t know why we took such a step when we planned to improve our relationship after the summit, an embassy official said, taking note that the move might have been carried out on the grounds of China`s political intention. The Chinese Embassy in Seoul had initially expected disciplinary measures against some travel agencies until the morning of July 20, but it turned out to be "" all-out and uniform "" after the conference was announced. Some in the tourism industry speculated that the Chinese government imposed restrictions on Beijing and Shandong Province only, but that other travel agencies illegally applied or applied for the trip. There are conflicting opinions on whether the Chinese authorities set foot on local travel agencies and the South Korean media reports before and after the summit talks hit China hard, the travel agency representative said. The domestic travel industry is devastated. A group of 10 to 20 small groups came in from Beijing, Qingdao and last month and were suddenly notified yesterday that their visas were blocked, officials said. A representative of the travel agency said, I was informed that after the summit between Korea and China, I felt much better and was embarrassed by such a notice. A Shinsegae Duty Free Shop official who strengthened its marketing efforts to attract Chinese after the lifting of parts last month said, We don`t have much of a blow since the rainy season, but we hope it won`t last until the Lunar New Year holiday next year. Duty-free stores such as Hotel Shilla, Hanwha, and Galleria Time World and other China-related stocks such as Amore Pacific all declined on the same day. The Supreme Court has finalized its original decision on October 21, which gave a suspended sentence of two years in jail, in consideration of Cho's alleged breach of the Aviation Security Law.The two earlier convictions were made not guilty of violating the Aviation Security Law by changing the airline's route amid charges against Cho.Cho ordered Korean Air KE086, a carrier that was riding on board in December 2014 at JFK International Airport in New York for nuts, to be forced to return the plane to its boarding gate and sent it to the office.Plant 1 sentenced to one year in jail, but Plant 2 said, "" The route was meant to be pre-referenced as being clear to the public, "" adding, "" The Flight Safety Act was frequently adopted during operations.

It is presumed that someone gave birth to a baby and threw it away immediately, "" a police official said.Kim Dong-hwan, a reporter at kimcharr@segye.com and a merchant whose store sells live fish at Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market, Seoul, had a habit of gazing around at neighboring stores. It is the site of a man identified as Song (68) who has worked together for 40 years. The two business partners who depended on each other like sisters ended their separation last April. That is when Song moved into the new Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market. Merchants call it Sin-chang Market. Yoo faces the old mayor, who lives 10 meters between him. However, merchants ' minds are a long way off. `` It's empty. Still, I never go to Shin-Market. At the entrance of Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market, red phrases such as "" The threat of collapse "" are written on the page. Behind the old market you can see a new market building eight stories tall. About 300 nameless signboards are placed in the new mayor's office. It should have been a meeting between the merchants of the old market, including Yoo. "" I don't feel good about that. You should get in soon. If this happens, I will die on both sides. "" The old market, which has about 40 percent of its merchants left empty. There are about 300 signboards on the market that are not interactive. The new mayor opened in March last year. The conflict between the fisheries cooperative union and merchants in the traditional market has not been resolved until a year and nine months later. The two sides clashed over conditions of migration that erupted during the modernization of Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market. Seoul Metropolitan Government has held five meetings to resolve the conflict since October. We intended to find a solution by providing an opportunity for the parties to talk, a city official explained. However, they only checked each other's admission differences and kept breaking up. The association wants the merchants of the old market to move in and the merchants of the old market want to keep the old market afloat. It has an escalator and elevator set up at the sales area on the first floor of Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market, which opened last March. Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market (Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market) A general survey showed that some merchants refused to relocate to the new market, leaving Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market in two divisions. At the entrance of Gu market on November 18, the red letters "" to be torn down "" were written in a disorderly fashion. Near the site was a plaque called ' traditional Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market. ' There was also a placard reading, "" Stop the modernization of Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market. "" There were also many red words written by the association : "" Do not use public spaces. "" The red mark of ' to be demolished ' at the entrance to the old market There are about 270 people, or about 40 percent of all merchants, in the old market. They refuse to move into the new market because of high rents and tight spaces. "" Sales space decreased, and rent more than doubled, "" said Gu, 61, a market trader. Rents for Shin`s market are 1.5 to 2.5 times higher depending on the location of the old market. Compared to the old market, there is less space around the counter. Although the floor area of the store is the same as 4.95 ㎡ (1.5 pyeong), the old market is larger. The association claims the merchants of the old market have illegally used the aisles.The higher rent includes investment costs to improve the environment, said a union official. I asked Koo's merchants to move and they would give me a four-month exemption on rent, he said. On the other hand, Gu argued, "" There are rent and land issues, but we also want to preserve traditional market forms that have tradition in place. "" At the entrance of Gu Market, signs indicate the location of Sin-Market.

"Shooting warning after armed forces on March 21, warning stations … In case of the third round of warnings ... 2nd year of military defection from North Korea and the North Korean Central Military Commission against North Korea (PG), which led to the latest defection If the three-four-member North Korean soldiers who were fully armed at the time fire back at the South, a deadly situation would have occurred, including a firefight between the two sides.◇ Armed forces captured access to the anti-racial force MDL in less than an hour, warning and firing was carried out by North Korean soldiers, who arrived at the DMZ's main guard post at 8:04 a.m. yesterday. The military reportedly fired 20 K-3 machine guns with warning shots decades after warning against access to the MDL. Normally, if the North Korean military approaches MDL, they send out several warning signals and fire a warning shot if they disobey, but this time, they fired a warning shot only 10 seconds after the third warning broadcast. Military officials explained that the North Korean military pursuit team captured the approach to the MDL and made three warning announcements and twenty warning shots in less than a minute. - Some point out that the South Korean military might have swiftly responded by issuing a warning shot against North Korean soldiers when they defected to the Joint Security Area at Panmunjeom on July 13. Two shots were heard from North Korea at 10:13 a.m. and 10:16 a.m., less than an hour after the South Korean military fired warning shots, but no sign of firing near the South Korean GP was found yet. The shots from the North seem to have responded to the South's warning shots, but the exact intentions have not been revealed yet. ◇ 2nd year of enlistment = The first time a North Korean soldier has left the country is known to be his second year of military service. Given that the North Korean military service period is approximately 10 years, two years are considered to be the number of recruits. He was about 19 years old and carried an AK rifle with a North Korean military personal. The North Korean soldier who had defected from the South rarely carried personal firearms, but this time, he is presumed to have escaped North Korea while on guard due to having an AK rifle with him. New recruits were transferred to the joint interrogation team, which is composed of the military, the National Intelligence Service and military personnel, and investigators are investigating into motives for defection. South Korean military authorities have analyzed the defection of four North Korean soldiers this year.A North Korean soldier gets off a jeep at the Joint Security Area in Panmunjeom on July 13 and runs south in a shooting accident.A military official said, "" If we continue to see our troops as frontline guards and were strictly educated on their minds, we will see the first two years of our defection from the North today, and North Korea will be the first to defect. "" Other officials said the effects of psychological warfare, such as the broadcast of loudspeakers to North Korea, appear to be creeping in, adding that harsh acts such as beating and scolding that is prevalent in the North Korean military and bad habits are also likely to motivate defection. On July 13, a North Korean soldier who defected to the DMZ said, "" I heard the South Korean psychological warfare and my supervisor beat me up and scolded me severely. "" Military officials believe that the South Korean Central Military Commission might have stirred over the announcement of psychological warfare against the North. We believe the broadcast of loudspeakers by North Korean soldiers has been enhanced in the Midwest front, military officials said. "" I have to see the joint newspaper results, "" he said, "" but if the fugitive soldier says, "" I was listening to a loudspeaker when I heard about the reason to defect, "" the announcer said, adding, "" If I could disarm the soldiers mentally by training, I was mentally armed with strong training. "" Military authorities are broadcasting via loudspeakers with K-pop songs and news programs north. The news also reflected news of defectors from the JSA and the healing process. The loudspeakers can transmit sound about 24 kilometers per night and 10 kilometers per day when the maximum output is raised. Meanwhile, our military police unit located in GP's office only received 100 meters of visibility due to thick fog, but they confirmed the soldier's defection from the GP 50-60 meters north of the GP to confirm it as surveillance equipment. threek@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!) ; Seoul = Nusist-16, a Palestinian girl activist ; and the video showed Ahedd Tami, who was arrested by Israeli soldiers on July 30, was shot on video.

Some investors claimed they were not compensated for all of the hacking damage in April. Finally, the Sobbit re-published on his homepage that he would announce the exact compensation after consulting law and accounting.Allegations were raised over the fact that the insurance company bought three billion won worth of cyber insurance with the DB damage insurance 18 days before the accident.Chung (42), who is now in Seoul from Gwangju, said, We only recompensed the damages caused by hacking in April when we had to pay the balance. Yoobit (then Yapizoon), who was hacked last April, compensated investors with virtual currency (Pei) or shares listed on the company's own. We have not yet received full compensation for April hacking, said Kim, 60, who is also known to have been involved in the hacking scandal.Although the company said it would adjust the balance of its investors to 75 percent, the confusion widened when a brief deal was made on July 19 around 10:00 p.m. Inquiries followed suit, saying, "" No actual transactions took place or the deal was "" still in progress.

A month ago, Yoobit notified us that it would stop the virtual account services, said a Woori Bank official, saying, Yoobit can`t stop when asked to pay from a parent bank account because there is no court order to close. In other words, most investors can not access a virtual account to withdraw investment funds.A client for the third year was furious, saying, I can`t believe whether the company really was hacked or actually paid next week. Yoobit bought a cyber comprehensive insurance coverage worth 3 billion won with DB damages insurance 18 days ago, not in April when the first hacker accident took place, raising suspicion of insurance fraud. The investigation should be completed after the accident is received and whether we are responsible or exempted, said the insurance company.Victims complained, "" 17 percent of their assets have been damaged, so why only pay back 75 percent of their assets, not 83 percent?

According to the household finance and welfare survey of 2017 jointly released by the National Statistical Office, the Bank of Korea and the Financial Supervisory Service, the Gini coefficient, the 5 percent of income group and the relative poverty rate all worsened year-on-year. The Gini coefficient rose by 0.003 to 0.357 from the previous year, while the income quintiles grew by 7.06 times and the relative poverty rate rose by 0.05 points to 17.9 percent from the previous year. 2017 Household financial welfare survey Gini coefficient is a typical indicator of the degree of inequality in income distribution, priced between 0 and 1, which means that the closer to one the more severe the inequality is. The income quintiles use the average income of the top 20 % (fifth percentile) of household income divided by the average income of the bottom 20 % (1st percentile) ; they mainly use disposable income values excluding non-tax expenditure such as taxes. A larger figure indicates an unequal distribution of income. Relative poverty rate is the proportion of the population to which the median income is less than 50 %. These indicators have improved slightly since 2008 and 2009, but have become worse. The National Statistical Office has changed the way it calculates indicators since the latest survey. The previous surveys had produced figures from on-site inspections of sample households. However, many households were reluctant to respond to the request, which led to criticism that it did not reflect the reality. As a result, the results of the investigation were used together with other ministries and agencies, including the National Tax Service, the social benefits data, property taxes, and credit information. It also excluded private transfer spending, i.e. household to non-profit group relocation, when seeking disposable income and market income to create income distribution indicators, reflecting recent recommendations from the OECD. Market income was therefore an arithmetic expression of ' work income + business income + property income + (private transfer income - private transfer expenditure) ' and disposable income was ' (labor income + business transfer income + property income) ' (private transfer income). Indicator of the distribution of income growth by focusing on low-income people, Moon Jae-in is that the government's shoulder became heavier means.

Gaguju is expected to retire at 66.8, but in reality, he retired at 62.1. That means you should retire sooner than you think. The overall income, assets and liabilities of the 2017 household finance and welfare survey all increased 4 percent year-on-year. Assets, debts, and household composition are the statistics as of the end of March, while income, expenditure, and repayment of principal and interest are the statistics of last year.

Hanwha ground defense officials said, "" The deal includes a K-10`s armored vehicle carrying K-10s ammunition, a package of self-propelled guns, and it is the first time that ammunition carriers are likely to be exported overseas. "" The K-9 self-propelled guns engaged in the Norwegian hot-propeller project competed with the equipment of major European defense companies such as Switzerland and Germany last January. In this process, excellent evaluation was obtained in the winter examination, proposal assessment, and actual response. Hanwha says the jajupo self-propelled guns performed extremely well regardless of weather and geographical conditions and received good reviews from Norwegian military officials. Hanwha Land Corp. explained, "" The efforts of the authorities have played a major role in the success of the export, "" adding, "" The Defense Commission jointly explained various government support efforts throughout the entire export process, including the Korean Defense Commission. "" The Defense Ministry and the Army have reportedly actively supported the test and evaluation processes for the K-9. The signing ceremony was attended by the head of the Norwegian Defense Agency, Hanwha Corporation Chairman Son Jae-il, ambassador to Norway Park Hae-yoon, and military attaché Kim Ki-ho. Chairman Sohn Jae-il said, We succeeded in signing the export deal, beating out the leading European competitors and gained greater recognition for our excellent performance and technology of K-9 self-propelled guns, which led to overseas marketing. Some say that the contract is an objective indicator that Korean defense products are competitive in the European market, which has long been dominated by European defense companies. K-9 self-propelled guns are currently deployed in Korea since 2000, having been developed independently by the Korea Institute of Defense Research and Development and Korean technologies. Hanwha ground defense (former Samsung Techwin → Hanwha Techwin → Hanwha ground defense) entered the defense industry in 1983, developed and produced ground weapons systems, and played a key role in enhancing the combat power of Korean soldiers. As a core defense service provider of Hanwha Group in 2015, it has been able to function as a core unit of the group`s defense sector and maximize synergy with its defense affiliates. In July 2017, Hanwha Techwin Corporation's defense business headquarters was divided into Korean ground defense and land defense, and thus equipped with an independent management system specialized in it. ▶ threek@yna.co.kr driver information and contact (Click!) the latest fashion trend area, all (Click!)

"[Read Media by Kim Ik-hyun] & apos ; Battery & apos ; Unshowed Regret (Jidinet Korea = Kim Ik-hyun) : Let's be frank and start. I am using Apple iPhone 6. Since it was purchased in early 2015, it has been used for two years and 10 months.However, the processing speed has slowed noticeably this year. Many people have missed out on pictures due to the slow response speed of the iPhone while taking them in a hurry.There must have been a lot of people like me. There were three main "" theories "" that went around.1. Updating a new iOS on an older iPhone will slow you down.2. This is due to the substantial addition of new features to the new version of iOS.3. Apple's trick is to buy new models.Many users saw this as a natural phenomenon as the performance of iOS increased. However, controversy over ` intentional deterioration ` began early this month in the U.S. From iOS 10.2.1 launched in February last year, the company has followed a detailed analysis that a limitations on the performance of its older phones have been applied.Apple says it has no choice but to limit the performance of its older iPhone to provide the best experience for consumers. (Photo : Jidinet Korea) ■ Apple's efforts were made to stop the iPhone from crashing. "" We have indeed reduced the performance of our older iPhones, "" he said in an official document on Tuesday. Of course, it is not to induce the purchase of a new model, he added. Apple explained why it lowered the performance of its older iPhone.First, lithium-ion batteries can not withstand peak power when they are cold, under-charge, or old.Second, therefore, to protect electrical components, the device may suddenly be down.Third, to prevent this, the iPhone 6, 6Gb/s, and SE adopted an instant maximum power cut last year.Fourth, this year, the same measure was applied to iPhone 7, releasing iOS 11.2.To sum up, here is Performance restrictions are correct, but they are all intended to provide the best experience for consumers. Otherwise, your iPhone could crash unexpectedly. A slightly lower performance may provide a better experience for users when they are worried about being down.Apple's explanation has cleared two misunderstandings.With the addition of new iOS features, the misunderstanding is that the old iPhone isn't good enough, and the misunderstanding is that Apple was able to handle the optimal performance for just two years to get a new model. Still, I don't feel at home.IOS 12.1, iOS 10.2.1 powered iPhone 6Gb/s Benchmark Test Results (Photo = Geekbench) 1. "" And I don't know why I haven't made this announcement so far, "" he said. That is where consumers are most enraged.Apple believes that the measure to slow down its iPhone is not meant to encourage the purchase of new models. However, not a few aspects have resulted in that.Let's count the odds. Apple offers a new version of iOS at any time. Each time a variety of new features are added.If you are an iPhone user, of course, you want to use a new function. But when I download a new iOS, it becomes slower. There has been a weak (?) myth among iPhone users that "" it's best not to update a new iOS after it's been released. ""Under these circumstances, what choices would consumers make? Eventually, the iPhone will lean toward its new model. The omission of notices indicating that batteries may be replaced has resulted in the purchase of new models.2. What complicated procedure to replace the battery with? Now that I know, people like me can replace the battery. But it is too scary again.Regarding this, US economic media Quartz said, "" Replacing the iPhone battery is not the same as replacing the AA battery with a digital camera. ""The cost is not too steep for now. The price of the new product is $ 79 in the U.S. and the official replacement price is 88,000 won in Korea. Private companies charge around 50,000 won.Apple admitted it had intentionally slowed down the old iPhone to avoid being disconnected from the cold or old battery.(Photo = Cinet) Of course, there is also a method to directly change the battery after purchasing it. If this occurs, the cost will be cut to around 20,000 won. But there is a lot of technology to do.Replacement procedures are also annoying. Apple's official repair shop is expected to have a long queue before they can be replaced. Fortunately, except near Apple Authorized Repairers, they can take a good one day.3. New Model to Reduce Performance in One Year?Of course, it is not just Apple's problem that smartphones lose their performance after a certain time. It is estimated that other smartphones may experience slight degradation of performance, although there is a difference in their levels.However, Apple's actions are considered too harsh."" It is exceptional to have a rapid decline in processing in one or two years, "" the U.S. IT media noted. This is because they are treating high-end electronic goods, which cost about 1 million won, as extractions in just one year.4. Couldn't you have solved the problem by increasing the size of your battery?Finally, the question is, "" Was the iPhone degradation inevitable? ""Durberry also noted, "" It is unacceptable for an iPhone with $ 700 to $ 1,000 to fail to function at its highest level in more than a year. ""Apple could have extended peak performance periods by using methods such as installing larger batteries, the official said.If that was not possible, they could make it easier to replace the batteries. Otherwise, we can think of ways to lower the cost of replacing the battery.Apple explained the iPhone's performance limitations were "" a move to provide the best experience for consumers. "" If Apple had really considered the best experience & the best, I think it should have considered the four issues that were raised earlier.▽ Reporters=Newspaper (sini@zdnet.co.kr) ; Please subscribe to Jidinet Korea on Naver.

"4 Premature Children Live in Ewha Hospital 7 % of the total births rose to less than 37 weeks of pregnancy ' Underdeveloped baby ' 20 years ago, and the twin conditions of infant care unit and infant care unit are vulnerable to diseases ▽ Central Photo = Premature and underweight babies who go to intensive care unit after birth are steadily increasing due to manhorn and elderly pregnancy. Four infants who died in a succession in the intensive care unit of a newborn at Ewha Womans University Hospital are also premature. The children, who were born between 25 and 34 weeks ago, had to stay in intensive care unit incursions and receive fluid injections. Premature babies usually refer to babies born 37 weeks before conception. According to the National Statistical Office yesterday, the number of premature babies who were 4.8 percent of the total newborn babies in 2005 rose to 7.2 percent (29,939 babies) last year. Premature babies are especially found in pregnant women who give birth to twins. The average infant is 37-41 weeks pregnant, with 94.8 % of births. On the other hand, 62.1 percent of twins are premature in less than 37 weeks. It has consistently exceeded 50 percent since 2008. Overweight babies who are underweight are similar. Overweight babies weighing less than 2.5 kilograms were 3.1 percent of the total newborns in 1996. Last year, however, the figure doubled to 5.9 percent. In particular, the rate of under-weighted babies who weigh less than 1.5 kg and have a higher health risk is higher. The proportion of babies born out of wedlock was quadrupled during the same period, from 0.17 percent to 0.68 percent. Because of this, the average weight of both male and female newborns was 3.25 kg and 3.15 kg respectively, each, which was 0.04kg less than 10 years ago. Officials enter and leave the hospital while police are investigating a case in the intensive care unit of a newborn baby at Ewha Womans University Hospital yesterday. [Photo Collateralizer] What makes a child move faster and lighter? The most important influence is the delayed marriage and the rising age of pregnancy and childbirth. The average age of childbirth, which was 28.1 in 1996, turned 30.4 years later and reached 32.4 last year. That means mothers have become about 4 years older in the past 20 years. In particular, the average age of mothers with premature babies is higher. A typical infant mother of 37-41 weeks is 32.4 years old, but a baby is 33 weeks old when pregnant. Compared to the more than 42 weeks of age (age 32), they are about one year older. Another important reason is the increase in the number of twins between couples who try artificial insemination due to increased age of childbirth and confusion. Twins share a 1.4 percent share of babies born in 1996, but the figure rose to 3.9 percent in 20 years. 35 - 39 - (5.5 %) and 40 + (3.9 %) are much older than 24 (1.4 %). In addition, mothers who suffer a lot of stress or who suffer from diseases such as pregnant high blood pressure and diabetes are more likely to have premature babies. Kim Dong-seok, head of the Korea Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic, said, "" Older mothers lack in many premature and underweight infants due to premature labor or lack of growth, "" adding, "" There are many cases in which pregnant women are born with twins due to their age. "" The average age of mothers with children and the rate of having twins is increasing every year. Such premature or underweight babies are more susceptible to disease than normal newborns. Due to the lack of an immune system, it is easy to get infected. The death rate of premature babies is 23.7 per 1000 babies (2015), 20 times higher than that of births over 37 weeks (1.1 babies). In particular, the shorter the time the fetus stays in the mother's womb and the smaller the weight at birth, the less healthy it is. As a result, most premature babies are transferred to the intensive care unit of newborns. As treatment technology has improved recently, the survival rate of premature babies in Korea has increased. The survival rate of underweight babies who stayed at 83.2 percent in 2007 rose to 87.9 percent in 2015. The number of intensive care centers for newborns who can treat premature babies has also increased. The number of beds for premature babies rose from 1,299 in 2011 to 1,176 in 2015. However, the treatment infrastructure is still inadequate. Each of the nurses in the intensive care unit of a newborn was 1.18 in 2011, but four years later, it decreased to 1.04. As the birth age grows, we expect more babies to become premature or underweight, said Kim Dong-seok. We need a better medical infrastructure for high-risk groups to come, said the government, We need to be more proactive in providing support for infant intensive care units.

The wedding of Bianca in bold one-button wedding suit minus inner wear and Mick Jagger on floral print shirts with sneakers and ties is recorded as one of the most fashionable weddings in history. The two had a daughter, but they divorced in 78. Bianca from Nicaragua is currently active as a human rights activist. Rita Wilson, who married Hollywood actor Tom Hanks (1988), appeared at the wedding in a mini body conscious dress symbolizing the 80s. Dress was an exception, but the two are Hollywood's representative Incot couple, who celebrates their 29th wedding anniversary this year. One of the keys to a happy marriage is to let each other's individuality work out. We met while making a movie. So we know very well that film is not just a livelihood, but a life itself. The two had sons, Colin Hanks, and their daughter, Elizabeth Hanks, at their disposal. Colin Hanks is also an actor. Emma Thompson (1989), who is known as Emma Thompson (father is a playwright, mother and younger sister), sleeps in an art family. She is also a financial resource from Cambridge University. If you imagined Emma's wedding dress to be a formal piece of art, you would be wrong. She wore a white mini dress with pink and blue and a head with an unidentified decoration. Husband said British actor Kenneth Blanner and his marriage ended in 1995. Mariah Carey (1993), who married Tony Motola, then president of Soni Musik, her agency, in 1993, was the first singer to do so. Vera Wang's dress was slightly plain, but the train was eight meters long. The price of dresses was then $ 25,000. It was the best dress by Heyn Celine Dion (1994). Singer Celine Dion is 6 meters long in dress train. Her head-decorated crown weighed more than 3 kilograms. Seline Dionon's throat was so good that the wedding participants were all worried. Dion married her manager, Renee Angelille, of her first love, but left her husband with cancer in 2016. Herry Gwen Stephanie (2002), the gradation-from white to pink, had a refreshing dress. John Galliano is the work of Christian Dior. Gwen and Gavin Rossdill's wedding ended in 2015 in 13 years. Solanzie, who is famous for her younger sister, Harry Solanje Nowles (2014), married music video director Alan Ferguson. A smart wedding dress with a white gown with a cape around it, however, the film's one-round, cycling wedding has become all the more controversial.

""" I decided to go down the escalator for the elderly ... "" (Many citizens say, "" It is difficult to set up at subway stations in one direction, and run a test in Seoul because it is difficult to get up the stairs (mostly due to people's knee pressure of 15). "" For those who have difficulty walking down the stairs, the Seoul Metropolitan Government changed some escalators to their lower levels. Then, there were phone calls complaining, "" More people prefer the up escalator, "" and the city government's plans were on the brink of bankruptcy. The question of whether or not public facilities must abide by a large number of decisions is growing over the escalator change course.◇ Escalator operation direction is not changed = In Woojangsan station on Subway Line No. 5, exits from Woojang-san Station on the same side are placed on the sidewalk. There is one escalator at each exit. All are headed up. The Seoul Metropolitan Government changed the escalator to the down grade on August 20. That's because some elderly people on the subway complained that their knees hurt more when they went down the stairs. Then the civil service called on, "" Why change course when you have a lot more people using escalators in your climb? "" The applicant usually used the station during rush hour, when they were in middle aged. Eventually, Woojangsan Station changed its escalator to ascending in five days.An old man steps down the stairs leaning on a railing at City Hall Station, Subway Line No. 1, which is the only exit to be installed with an escalator up on it. The Seoul government has changed some escalators from up to down for those who are having a hard time walking down the stairs. However, three out of four test runs were returned to the upward position in spite of protests from residents. Reporter backsujin installed in seoul subway line 1 through 9 has 2,190 escalators. There are 156 escalators installed in one direction except for two way escalators. Among them, 141 are exclusive to going up. Among 70 stations with one escalator running, only 57 are operating up. Seoul City has changed some escalators to a tentative descent at four stations, including Woojangsan Station, Jeungsan Station, Mangseong Station and Suraksan Station. Byun Seo-young, director of Seoul Design Policy, said, "" There are many people who prefer the down escalator, "" adding, "" It is intended to be convenient for various users regardless of age, gender or physical conditions. ""Most people use a certain exit to go home or work. Citizens who were using the exit that changed the escalator's direction to the down grade began to file complaints. In some cases, a walking user could not read the notice while watching a smartphone and was about to fall out of the station using an escalator. A station worker said, "" I saw a sign and saw a station employee go out and guide himself, but it was hard to stop the customers from riding carelessly. "" Eventually, within a month, three out of the four subway stations, excluding Suraksan, had their escalators brought back up.Seoul City tried to test-drive the exit to the same India or cross the border so it would look like an escalator, but once it turned around, even citizens would face some inconveniences and get up a little bit. In reality, escalators are running without problem in Guro Digital Park Station on Line No. 2, with exit No. 2 going up and exit No. 3. The two exits are about 80 meters apart. The users are making good use of it without complaining.◇ Is it convenient for the citizens or is it too many or not too few? In a preliminary survey conducted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, 189 (67.5 %) preferred to go up on escalators, while 87 (31 %) preferred to go down. A city official said, About one in four people answered positively that they decided to go down even when monitored during the test run. Kim (age 72), prefers the down escalator, saying, My knees get cold every time I go down. Young people need to take escalators that are going up a little bit more.Experts point out that when walking down the stairs, the pressure on the body, such as the knee, is high and there is a high risk of falling. Park Kwan-kyu, an orthopedics professor at Shebrans Hospital, said, "" I can't determine which is harder, but it can get worse when I walk down the stairs when my cartilage is torn down. ""On the other hand, some critics say it is an `` excessive administration that does not reflect the majority opinion. '' Im (32), a worker who frequently uses Gwanghwamun Station, said, "" Most people have more difficulty walking up the stairs, "" adding, "" A few of us who have difficulty going down can take the elevator. ""[Back to Chosun Reporter.com] - Copirits ⓒ Chosun Ilbo & Chosun.com, No unauthorised reproduction and re-distributing - Korea Insurance's auto model will be reduced by 131 models starting next month … The Korea Insurance Development Institute announced on July 21 that 178 of 288 models have been rated, calculating the car model rating for next year's car insurance. The vehicle model class is rated according to the type of vehicle, by the extent of the damage or ease of repair, part price, and loss rate of loss in the event of an accident and is the basis for a self-insurance premium. The vehicle model is divided into grades 1 to 26, with the higher the cheaper the insurance. It is the cheapest and the first class is the most expensive. Although the premium difference between classes is 5 % and 10 %, the actual application rates by class are different for different insurance companies. As car insurance premiums are part of car insurance premiums, the total insurance premium is subject to fluctuations of only 1-2 %. As a result of adjusting car insurance coverage, 114 Korean cars were rated better and 31 were damaged. 24 models including Matiz Creative, K3, Magnus, Tosca, Malhabu, Mohave, Alpheon, Newhear XG and Reggio will have to pay lower premiums as they go up two notches. Morning, Forte, Lassetti, Gentra, Avante, Action, Ionik, LF Sonata, Opirus, SM7 and Aslan were all rated one up. Meanwhile, 16 models including SM6, Corando Turismo and Tivol are expected to be rated two and receive higher insurance premiums. Fifteen models, including Sonata (new model), Avante AD, Spark and Winstom, will have their premiums reduced by one percent. Import cars have improved the rating of 17 out of 66 models and worsened with 16. Six models, including the 300 C Chrysler, Audi A4 and Accord, are rated higher in terms of premiums, with the 11 models rising by one grade. Import cars are also highly expensive because their grades are too low. The Chrysler 300 C has improved in grade 2, but has moved from the most expensive first-class to the third. Eight models including BMW X26 and Land Rover Discovery are rated second, while the other eight models such as Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Altima are rated first, raising insurance premiums. Vehicle model grade data can be found by looking up "" Vehicle Criteria "" on the Insurance Development Institute's homepage or by looking up "" Vehicle Model Grade "" on the Society of Automotive Engineers ' affiliated websites. The status of vehicle model adjustment [Insurance Development Institute Provident=Conference News] said, "" Vehicle model grades are about damage and repair of vehicles, so it should not be confused with other assessment factors, such as safety or excellence. "" The car manufacturer was quoted as saying, "" Because of the significant differences in the damage rates of each model even among equivalent vehicles, the repair effort must be made to reduce the cost of the parts, such as when designing a new car, or to reduce the cost of the parts.

"- LG Premium's series of critically acclaimed phones were the only "" Camera Performance Interesting""All of the Best Supporting Division "" in the second-half.According to LG Electronics on July 21, Cellulare, an Italian mobile phone magazine, conducted an analysis and assessment on 20 of its latest premium smartphones, including Apple iPhone 8 Plus and Samsung Galaxy Note 8. There are five evaluation items : completeness, display, audio, camera and performance.Of these, the ES30 Plus decorated the cover of the magazine with a perfect score of 5 on all of the tested items. The only group with a perfect score in all areas was the ES30 plus. The media praised the ES30 Plus as the "" best product with more advanced multimedia features, "" rating it for its performance above the top tier in the premium market.In particular, the most interesting point of the media is the differentiated camera (glass crystal clear lens, cine-effects that can be filmed like a movie), and the point zoom that enables users to do so without being swayed. He also noted that the receiver which serves as a receiver was equipped with an auxiliary microphone to improve the quality of the recordings.As for displays and audio, the assessment was "" the best choice for game lovers. "" In addition, the display of the FAS30 Plus fast graphics processing speed and a thin border (bezel) increases the sense of immersion. Only the FAS30 plus one with 128 GB of storage space was included in the new research.It is the first time LG Electronics has released its interactive V-series smartphone via a European mobile carrier. Europe prefers small and practical smartphones to larger ones, but its consumers are confident that the 6-inch V0 and waplus market can capture the bigger screen, while reducing size and weight.The FAS30 also scored 4.5 points out of 5 on its British media technology radar, the highest score among premium smartphone rivals in the second half. Media, in particular, picked sophisticated design first, and recommended OLED full-feeds, the thinnest and lightest appearance of the six-inch smartphone and reduced the bezel.

"Shin Joon-hee (Yonhap News Agency), the head of Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital, is in the conference room to talk to the bereaved families of the newborns who died at the hospital on July 20. ▽ Frishment-Conference News : In the case of the death of four newborns at Ewha Womans University's Mok-dong Hospital, hospital management loopholes have been revealed. As of July 21, Ewha's Mok-dong Hospital was criticized for its overall failure, including inadequate initial response, follow-up measures, and sanitary management of the intensive care unit for infants during an accident on July 16. Bereaved families are complaining that the hospitals are being inconsistent with their behavior. ◇ As medical infection such as the contaminated sap and needles of the cause of death was weighed down, it was pointed out that the management of the intensive care of the infant intensive care unit was inadequate. It is also becoming increasingly disappointing to see doctors wonder whether the contaminated hands caused infections, and if not, that they did not follow the rules of basic hygiene. Premature babies are usually significantly immune, so any bacterial infection can be fatal to a child. Bereaved families also "" dumped their diapers on the floor and picked it up with their hands, "" "" We put a packerman's nipple right in the baby's mouth, "" and "" We saw an infant nurse feeding the infant with powdered milk at an intensive care center. "" In relation to this, the hospital reportedly apologized for its lack of supervision. As the dead children were treated with the nutrient sap, the solution was considered clean, and sanitation problems were growing. An infectious medicine professor at a university hospital said, If the infusion was contaminated with premature babies, bacteria could flourish for an hour, and if it was injected properly, it would have to lead to a deadly septic shock.Shin Joon-hee, a reporter at Ewha News Station in Seoul (. nyuseu = yeonhap) : Families of newborns who died at Mok-dong Hospital are going to attend a closed-door meeting with hospital officials on July 20. hama@yna.co.kr continued to have conflicts with her family members, saying, "" The families asked the hospital to give us a clear explanation on the situation from the evening of the 15th to the day of the death of the last week. "" Revoking the cancellation of their interview with the hospital the previous day, the family head said, I asked for their status, but I provided only a few lines of information, some of which were inconsistent with the nursing records. If it is true that what the bereaved family members knew about the treatment and information provided by the hospital were not consistent, it is likely that the hospital will be criticized for poor patient care. Parents who moved their children to other hospitals also pointed out that the hospital did not explain them properly. After meeting with a hospital on July 19, they complained to reporters, We moved our child to another hospital and had no explanation. Some were even reported to have realized the seriousness of the situation only after hearing that the bereaved family cried after the accident. Some say the hospital did not turn on the temperature control function in an ambulance, and powered up the child. They say that the government failed to properly manage even the children who survived the disease. jandi@yna.co.kr ▶ Report and inquiry (Click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (Click!) [Research team on cancer cells using sperm and bacteria] [Development of a robot that can fight cancer cells with cancer cells and deliver a drug to a normal cell. "" Bacteria and immune cells also join the cancer cells as humans control them. The advantage is that no extra energy is needed for transportation, and that it can avoid immune rejection. The effects have already been documented in animal testing. In the near future, sperm robots and bacteria are expected to be seen in groups attacking cancer cells.◇ Magnetostatic sperm robots = Scientists at the German Dresden Integrated Nanoscientifics Research Institute recently released a U.S.-certified "" ACS nano "" journal with cancer. The researchers reported that when sperm was released into a mass of cancer cells raised in a culture dish, 87 percent of the cancer cells died in three days.The scientists dipped the sperm into a poison rubicin, which is now commonly used to treat cancer. Then, anticancer drugs accumulate in the head of sperm. As a result of analysis, 15 picograms per sperm (1 trillion grams per sperm per gram) were accumulated. Toxin Ruby God blocks the enzymes needed to grow cells and kills cancer cells.Next, iron helmets were applied to the head of sperm. The helmet is shaped forward with four metal arms slightly out of the bend. While watching the ultrasound images, the researchers moved the magnets outside of the culture dishes and lured the sperm into the shape of a lump of cancer. When the ball hits a mass of cancer, the metal arms grow out and the sperm springs forward. Like when combined with an egg, sperm can penetrate and deliver anticancer agents to the cancer cells with an enzyme that dissolves cell membranes.Anticancer drugs are highly toxic, damaging not only cancer cells but also normal cells around them. Because of such side effects, it is hard to increase the amount of anticancer drugs at will, therefore, it is hard to get more than a certain amount of medicinal effects. If the sperm can deliver the drug to the cancer cells, as shown in the latest sperm robot, the normal cells can not be injured and it can be effective. Sperm is optimized to work in female reproductive organs and can be applied to the treatment of a wide range of women diseases, such as endometriosis and extracerebral pregnancy, German researchers said.◇ Bacterial robots are also being tested for treatment effects and Korean scientists are actively engaged in producing biological robots to treat cancer. Professor Park Jong-oh at the Microchedical Robot Center at Chonnam National University said in an international academic journal, "" The C.I.Untitipic Report, "" that the detoxicity of the germ salmonella species can be documented with an anticarcinogenic bead. Salmonella swings with a flagellar tail like a whip. Park named the robot "" Bacteriobot, "" a combination of "" bacteria "" and "" robots. ""The researchers used food poisoning bacteria because of its ability to visit cancer cells. Food poisoning organisms live in a lean environment. Inside the body, it is around cancer cells. Cancer cells grow so fast that they are always short of oxygen. On the other hand, it is more beneficial for food poisoning bacteria because it is full of nutrients and has few immune cells. Last year`s cell experiment confirmed that a paclithot-based bacteriobot called the Paklitaxel kills more than half of the cancer cells in 48 hours, Professor Park Jong-oh said.Park Seok-ho, a professor at Chonnam National University, announced in a cyantic report last July a robot equipped with anticancer drugs in its macrophages, a type of immune cell. The researchers placed anticancer and iron oxide particles into polymer beads. If you put it into a macrophage and take a magnet from outside, the iron oxide inside of the polymer beads will follow. In this way, macrophages can be transported to cancer cells. There is no rejection of the way immune cells are used, said Professor Park Seok-ho.Professor Sylvin Mattel of the ECO-Polytechnique Montreal, Canada, originally used magnetoscopic bacteria that prefer magnetic fields. As a result, it is easy to control the particle with a magnet without having to inject it with iron oxide. 'Nature, nanotechnology' the researchers last year "" In experiments using mice, bacteria in a paper released by the 200 times their length per second of treatment on cancer cells and the streets.The substance, said. An adult who is 170cm tall is equal to the speed of sound with 340 meters per second. It is literally an induced missile for attacking cancer cells.
