"The face of Kim Seong-gwan (35), who was forcibly returned to New Zealand after killing three members of his family including his biological mother and stepfather, was revealed yesterday. Kim Seong-gwan (left), who was revealed by the New Zealand press before he was deported back to the country, and Kim's face was covered by the East Coast Guard's lunch room, which was released to the media on July 14. The Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency held an individual disclosure decision committee on July 12 and decided to disclose his face and real name if Kim receives a warrant in an interrogation of a suspect before he was detained. Kim Seong-gwan, who was detained after being extradited to New Zealand after killing the family of his innocent mother, is on the move to the eastern police station in Yong-in, Gyeonggi Province, yesterday. [Yonhap news Agency] Kim looked perplexed in front of reporters. When reporters pressed the shutter, Kim turned to the other side to avoid appearing. When she returned from the detention center, Kim headed as low as she could to avoid being seen on the camera. Kim Seong-gwan, a judge of a Suwon District Court's warrant, held interrogation before arrest and issued an arrest warrant for Kim on July 12. We are concerned about the destruction of evidence and the transportation, Cho said. Kim reportedly admitted to having committed a criminal case made by the police during an investigation. As Kim left the eastern police station in Yong-in to attend the hearing on the warrant prosecutions at the Suwon District Court, there is evidence of complicity with his wife. Admit it, but did not answer questions from reporters asking, "" Why did you kill me? "" or "" Did you plan to commit the crime? "" I am sorry. Kim Seong-gwan (35), who was detained after being extradited to New Zealand after killing the family of his innocent mother, travels to the eastern police station in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province yesterday afternoon for questioning. [Yonhap news] Earlier in the day, Kim was murdered by his paternal mother (then 55) and two younger brothers (then 14) for the purpose of spending money in an apartment building in Cheoin-gu, from Oct. 21 to 5 p.m. last year. After the crime, Kim took his wife and daughters (then two or seven months) to New Zealand via Incheon International Airport and was caught stealing from New Zealand police. The Justice Ministry sent Kim home on July 11 in consultation with New Zealand's judiciary authorities. Police arrested Kim on July 13 on charges of robbery and murder. A suspect, identified as Kim, who was extradited to New Zealand after killing his mother's family, appears at the eastern police station in Yong-in, Gyeonggi Province yesterday afternoon to have her arrest warrant screened. Police requested an arrest warrant for Kim Thursday on charges of killing a robber. Yonhap news agency reportedly admitted it was a scheme to make a fortune, saying, I have long wanted to kill my mother, but decided to do so a day or two before the crime. Han Young-hye, reporter Han.Younghye Joongang.co.CRT, sent a famous Japanese daily newspaper [Facebook + Friend] [Mobile web page [Central Daily and JTBC] to non-redistribution.A similar incident happened again in Japan.Tokyo correspondent Hwang Bo-yeon reports.Last June, a 37-year-old man suddenly felt a terrible headache and tongue paralysis.I put the cigarette I received from a friend in a balloon and smoked it with a heated electronic cigarette.The man smoked 14 cigarettes a day. Police investigating the man's reports that he was smoking bad, confirmed that the cigarette butts and blood tests contained deadly mercury.Mercury is not a problem when it is in liquid state, but heat is applied by over 300 degrees and becomes much more toxic when it becomes a gas.The man was most likely also breathing in strong toxic mercury.[Numaza, Satosho, and Professor of Pharmacology : If you inhale the mercury vapor, you will see a neurological disorder. Some people died from drinking mercury from the steam.Police arrested a 36-year-old man named Miyawaki who handed over cigarettes.Miyawaki admitted to the crime, saying she put 0.3 to 0.5g of liquid mercury in the filter per cigarette.[Resident : I'm surprised. You don't seem like someone who would do that.Miyawaki was the president of the mobile phone repair company where the injured man used to work.Police, however, say they were divided over the issue because they had not been paid.Police said he even considered the nature of mercury, which increases the toxicity of Miyawaki when she becomes a fighter, and charged her with attempted murder.This is MBC's Hwang Bo-yeon from Tokyo."
"▽ People in Gangnam and downtown areas = Bundang, Pangyo, short for sale, and cold winds in the suburbs such as Nowon, Gangbuk …? I have a lot of customers who want to buy, but I don't have anything to sell. "" It's just a kick in the off-season, when you buy the groceries, and you raise the prices by 50 million won. "" "" It's quiet here. Due to the tight loan, even the actual buyer can't afford to buy the house, and because the house prices have dropped, multiple home owners can not afford to pay anything. Gangnam is a totally different place to think that it is overheating. "" As the excessive heat wave started to develop rapidly at the end of last year, the price of apartments in Gangnam and other metropolitan areas is running short, prompting a steep rise in sales. Meanwhile, the high-density apartments in Nowon-gu, Seongbuk-gu, and Geumcheon-gu saw their prices drop from the upward trend, with the prices falling from the previous month. The polarization is growing in the same Seoul area as the government`s regulations on multiple home owners have created what is called the "" smarter one. ""Since the beginning of this year, the price of apartments in Seoul has increased dramatically. A photo shows an information message posted at an agency in Songpa-gu. [Yonhap news photo] If you follow the lead in the sales of apartments in Seoul to downtown on October 11.4 percent, you will see an increase in prices of apartments last week … "" The rate of increase has returned to the level immediately before the announcement of the August 2 package. Jamsil Jugong Apts in Songpa-gu, Seoul sold only 1.5 billion won for a dedicated area of 76 ㎡ before allowing reconstruction on the 50th floor in early September, but the sale price recently hit the jackpot of 1.85 billion won. It was a 400 million won jump in just four months. The price tag for the 82 ㎡ apartment complex is currently 1.177 billion to 2 billion won, and is about to break through. A representative of an brokerage firm in Jamsil Jugong said, "" In the past, the price of apartments had increased by 10 million won. Now, an increase in sales is too much to worry about, and the bid for an extra 50 million won has gone up. "" In Eunma Apartment, another apartment in Daechi-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, where sales are also running short, there will be a deposit Olympics among brokerage firms when one apartment is available for sale. Each agency is in a race to "" fire "" the landlord's account before issuing a down payment, after announcing the sale to waiting buyers. When one is put up for sale, the contract is finished in a few hours. Since we can`t borrow anything after the 8-2 measures, we need more than 1 billion won in monthly rent, and everybody is ready with cash. The apartment complex, which had been worth 1.2 billion won in early September, now has a market price range of 1.56 billion to 1.58 billion won. "" With the completion of reconstruction of low-story apartments in Apgujeong-dong, Gangnam-gu, the next round of construction projects in Apgujeong-dong, Jamsil Jugong, Daechi Eunma, and other small-tier apartments have all emerged as a major market leader. "" In particular, funds from "" big fat hands "" are pouring into the Gangnam market. A representative at a local brokerage house in Apgujeong-dong, Gangnam-gu, said, "" It seems that as the prices of apartments have dropped recently, wealthy people are under the obsession that they shouldn't buy apartments, and it is easy to strike a bargain note. "" The price of apartments to be rebuilt in Gangnam is becoming more expensive than ordinary apartments. The government started to revamp its holding tax to increase the comprehensive real estate tax on expensive homes at the beginning of the year. Risencheu Jamsil, Songpa-gu, only 84.9 ㎡ area is Moon Jae-in is currently 1.15 billion won 11 million before the market is currently 1.6 billion won. A representative of a nearby brokerage house said, I thought the government would lose money by increasing the holding tax, but I wonder what the government would worry about in terms of raising the price of sales by more than 100 million won per year.Since it has been more than 30 years since the construction of Jamsil Jugong, Songpa-gu, Seoul, and the area is close to the site, the middle-layer apartments that can be rebuilt in a few years will also be stronger. Gaepo Woosung 1-2 Cha, Olympic athletes ' village and press center, Munjeong-dong Family, Mok-dong New Town Apts. Dosim-seoul apartments, also called Ma Yong-seong, Yongsan-gu, Seongdong-gu, and Gwangjin-gu, are also very early. Redevelopment projects including nearby New Town are under way, and new apartments are moving in and out, driving up prices. Existing apartments are still packed with "" gap investors, "" who are renting a house on hire because of the cost of rent. Local agencies explain that 10 to 15 contracts have already been made for the first time this year in the case of Byoksan-Megatrium, Hangangno 2-ga, Yongsan-gu. The agency head said, It looks like apartments that were almost unsold in November or December were initially traded and have no sale this year. The 84-square-square ㎡ house for Raemian Prugio in Ahhyeon-dong, Mapo-gu recorded the highest price ever, selling for 1.73 billion won, compared to 1.5 billion won two months ago. Among the new towns, the ground in early part of Seoul, such as Bundang, Pangyo, and Wirye, is strong. In particular, the price of Bundang and Pangyo are priced as they are likely to be developed on the basis of favorable factors, such as the construction of Pangyo Venture Town and development of Techno Valley. We buy them not only from Bundang but also from the metropolitan area and the provinces, said the broker in Jeongja-dong, Seoul, where buyers continue to visit and the atmosphere is unusually hot.

Seoul, Seoul and Nowon-gu, Seoul differs from Seoul's Gangnam and downtown apartments In the last 8-2 plan, Nowon-gu, which is designated as a speculation zone and speculation zone, has not been able to recover since prices dropped following the announcement of measures. Deokgye-dong Boram apartment complex's current price range is about 400-101 million won, down about 10 million won from the day before the 8-2 measures, but the deal is rare. The price of Danggye-dong silver apartments on 49.77 ㎡, formerly known as Danggye-dong silver apartments, fell 10 million won to 260 million to 270 million won. "" Gangnam is a residential area with billions of won to live in the middle of the year, "" said one broker in Sanggye-dong. "" Now apartments cost 300 to 400 million won to live in, and people here want to check out on loan. "" "" Regulating the loan was not a problem for the rich, but the working class who didn't really have the money hurt, "" the official said. "" If you don't have enough small apartments to pay, you can treat multiple mortgage holders. "" A representative of a local brokerage house in Wolgye-dong said, "" After the 8-2 measures, neither rent nor sell could be done, "" and added, "" The government is so obsessed with balloon effects that the market is heavily regulated to the point of ordinary people. "" SK Bukhansan City and Byoksan Live Park in Buksan-dong, Gangbuk-gu were also cheaper than before the 8-2 measures, but can not make transactions even when they were put up for. Gangnam has become quieter this year than it is, said a representative at a local brokerage in Mia-dong, Seoul, who said, Talking about other countries. The government`s one-household-one-house policy to regulate multiple residents ends up saving the residents of Gangnam alone, he said, adding, What is wrong with the measures? sms@yna.co.kr, The government has banned virtual currency transactions on July 14 at the Chunchu Gallery in Seoul.Regarding the controversy over the regulation of virtual currency, Cheong Wa Dae announced on July 14, "" Since the announcement of special measures at the pan-government level, nothing has changed.

It lost 3.3 billion dollars per day (approximately 3.5 trillion won). The original Facebook page was posted on her Facebook page on July 12. It was unusually long. The statement is called the ' shock declaration. ' Facebook's management is forecast to change significantly in the future. To sum up, here is Facebook intends to reduce commercial content and concentrate more on personal communication between family members and friends, which was originally intended. Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chane have created the Chen-Jerkberg Foundation to support Sermit School's education reform project. [Photo : Zuckerberg Facebook] Listen to Zuckerberg himself. We have recently received such feedback from our community. That's the post from businesses, products and media, that is, public content is driving away personal moments of connecting out each other -- private from public content. `` The first change you will see is that you can expect to see more post messages from groups like your friends and family on the news feed. This way, you will see that the post we post from business, products, and content media is public contents. However, it was the exact opposite for investors. It was not good news for them at all. Facebook shares were in a slump on Tuesday. Share prices once went down to 5.5 %. It was the biggest decline since November 2016. In the end, the company closed at $ 179.37, down 4.47 percent from the previous day. At the same time Zuckerberg lost a lot of money. Bloomberg's assessment of Zuckerberg's property has decreased by $ 3.3 billion a day. The world's richest person also saw a shift in his or her standing. Zuckerberg, who was the world's fourth-largest millionaire until the previous day, moved down one step to fifth. Instead of Mark Zuckerberg, who announced his new Facebook slogan, the fourth-place spot was taken up by fashion group Jazza's founder, Amancio Ortega (82). Ortega's wealth was 76.2 billion dollars, higher than that of Zuckerberg (74 billion dollars). Investors are worried about Facebook's decline in earnings. Facebook is no longer a startup for college students. The company needs money as it grows. They need to maintain an expensive system and pay their employees. Investors need to bear fruit of higher stock prices, too. The money comes mostly from advertising revenue. As Zuckerberg describes "" public content "" as decreasing, so does the amount of time users spend. Of course, advertising revenue decreases. The announcement by Zuckerberg is astonishing to investors. Zuckerberg doesn't deny that consumption time is decreasing. Rather, it meets Zuckerberg's intent. `` It's clear what I want. The change is expected to reduce the time people spend on Facebook. But the time people spend on Facebook will be more valuable now, I want to save the sleep on Facebook. But in the short run, a decline in profits is inevitable. That is why investors reacted sensitive to Zuckerberg's comment. Zuckerberg abandoned his current clear profit for an uncertain future. There are also aspects that it makes sense to look at Facebook's startup process. Zuckerberg started his early social networking service in 2003 as a sophomore at Harvard University called Face Mash. He reorganized his service by using the name ' TheFaceBook ' in 2004 and changed his current name to Facebook in 2005. Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard University and has been at Facebook for more than 10 years since his honorary doctorate. The monthly number of users has increased to 2 billion. It is about one in four people around the world. Zuckerberg is still young. I was born in 1984 and I am 34 years old this year. It is because he is still young that he is able to deal with a serious challenge at the level of impact. The world is paying keen attention to the fearless challenges of the young entrepreneur in his thirties.

"We don`t think Chung Jae-seung, a physics professor at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), was able to answer the criticism that Rhyu Si-min was strongly critical of the cryptograph (so called virtual currency) frenzy again. Chung posted a longer article on his Facebook account on July 13, saying, I didn`t think my two lines of comment on Professor Rhyu Si-min's interview with the cipher message would turn out to be a newspaper article.

Rhyu Si-min, author of last December, jtbc ‘war of words’ in the Bitcoin fever ‘tulip bubble’ in the Netherlands and Roh Moo-hyun administration compared to ‘The Sea Story’. He also said, "" Since block chains are platforms for crypto-money, excessive regulation of crypto-money utilization did not fundamentally limit the utilization of block chains. "" - And the block chain's business code is not just about Finally, Chung said that the government's solution to view cipher money and block chains as "" social evils, "" such as the close of the exchange, should be approached in a way that would wipe out overheated speculation.

"Hidden in a Evacuation Place-...Disarm drivers off the road and sitting in a tunnel with their loved ones on Twitter posted the ‘ Seoul-Hail and Seoul-Missile ’ threat alert. According to the New York Times on July 13 (local time), "" ballistic missile threats to Hawaii. Find a shelter immediately. "" The time when the emergency alert message ' This is Not Training ' rang was around 8:07 a.m. The majority of the residents or tourists were still in bed, sleeping in sleep or sipping coffee on Waikiki Beach. The diligent surfers were out at sea early to surf. Hawaii, the closest U.S. state to North Korea, even began missile attack drills last month, so a short message was enough to rock the peaceful weekends. Foreign news agencies also reported the situation via flash news. CNN reported the scene of locals escaping in surprise under the title of ' From Heaven to Panic, ' and Reuters said, "" Tears and panic swept Hawaii. "" Hawaii's Emergency Management Agency (HEMA) corrected via Twitter about 10 minutes after the announcement of a misstep. However, no corrections were sent to the users of SNS, and many were seeking to verify the contents were genuine, prompting the state media to report that "" the missile warning was an error "" in its official state. Students from Hawaii's University who were alerted to the missile warning flocked to the shelter, and drivers on the road quickly drove to nearby tunnels. Honolulu local media said shortly after the warning was given, only empty cars remained on the H-3 motorway. High schools on Hawaii Island, where the wrestling championships were taking place, also responded skillfully by evacuated people to the gym. It is usually due to high waves, tsunami warnings, and the fact that they are used to dealing with them. "" Everyone cooperated, "" said Kelly Krugh, the school's athletic director. "" When people got together, they should use their cell phones to reach out to their loved ones, "" he said, explaining by coaches of several emotionally charged children. About 30 guests at the KauaI Island beach hotel gathered in the lobby with a perplexed look on their faces. They were guided by staff to an underground parking lot. Undaunted with little information, the volunteers calmed down by calling or finding out details on Twitter. Some young people finally burst into tears. Players who are competing at the PGA Tour Sony Open in Hawaii were also forced to make a scene of an evacuation. `` I sat in the bathtub with the children, '' Democratic Party Congressman Matt Lopresti told CNN. The self-employed have even closed their businesses early. Jamie Mallapot, a Honolulu hair salon owner, said, I woke up in the morning and saw a missile alert, and texted clients to close the store on the same day, canceling my reservation. Hawaii is not nearly as far as the Sight-Site Ballistic Missile (IRBM), but an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICP-12) is within range.

This measure indicates that the average concentration of ultrafine dust (PM2.5) exceeds 50 ㎍p from midnight to 4 P.M., and the day after that traffic is also expected to be ' bad ', with ' bad ' levels expected to be available. It is the first time that transportation is free due to the emergency reduction of dust. The emergency reduction measure was also implemented on July 29 because of high levels of dust, but the free transportation policy was not enforced because it falls on Saturday. Reduction in public transportation fees and a second subtitle for public institution vehicles are in effect on weekdays only. The exemption from public transportation charges applies for starting at the beginning of the day and leaving at 9 a.m. and leaving at 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Bus fares to downtown and village buses from Seoul, subway lines 1-9, and Uisinseol are exempt. Since the city is not involved in the Seoul emergency reduction measures, citizens can only ride the Seoul buses and subways for free. In case of confusion over which buses are free, the Seoul Metropolitan Government has developed a system that charges a user when he or she writes a transportation card on a terminal. Even though public transportation is free, you should take a transportation card and credit card with you to the terminal and take them. If you tag the cards as usual, you can automatically get charged for any number of transfers between Seoul and Gyeonggi buses.Lee Ji-eun (Yonhap News Agency), who is waiting for the bus to leave the office, said, "" I saw a man covering his face on Sejong-daero Street in Seoul yesterday afternoon. Take, for example, A, an office worker who rides a game bus in Paju, Gyeonggi-do, Seoul City, and travels to Jongno from Hapjeong-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul. Normally, A pays 1,250 won for a race bus ride, and then a transfer fee of 200 won for a Seoul bus is added to the price of 1,450 won. If the fare is free on July 15, he will have to pay only 1,250 won for the race bus fare. On the contrary, an office worker who takes a Seoul bus in Jongno and changes his office bus from Hapjeong-dong to Paju Book Park only pays 250 won for the bus. A basic fare for Seoul buses is exempt, and the fare is 50 won for switching to a race bus (the basic fare for race buses is 150 won, 50 won higher than that for Seoul buses) and 200 won per trip. The free transportation policy is the concept that the city pays public transportation fees in taxes. The Seoul Metropolitan Government expects that when the number of passengers are exempt from the commute to work, the transportation company will have to pay 5 billion won per day. A 20 percent increase in passengers due to free use policies costs 6 billion won a day. Seoul City expects the micro-dust emergency reduction measures to take effect about seven times a year, in view of the average year. chopark@yna.co.kr"
""" The M.O. is brutal and serious, "" (Suwon = Yonhap news agency) reporter Ryu Soo-hyeon : 35, who was extradited to New Zealand 80 days after the murder of his family and escape, will be released to Korea.Hong Ki-won, a reporter for Yong-in's family murder (Yong-in = Yonhap News Agency), murdered the family of his confessed mother and escaped to New Zealand in the afternoon before an arrest warrant was issued. Police requested an arrest warrant for Kim Thursday on charges of killing a robber. If the southern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency held an individual disclosure decision committee led by criminal chief Na Won-oh on July 12 and asked for a warrant to question the suspect before he was detained, it would say. Cho Young-eun, a judge of the Suwon District Court, issued an arrest warrant for Kim on July 13 at 6 p.m. on charges of robbery and murder. We are concerned about the destruction of evidence and the departure process, Cho said, explaining why the warrant was issued. Kim Seong-gwan is accused of stabbing a mother (55), a younger brother (14) and a stepfather (57) on October 21 last year. Kim, who took about 120 million won from his mother's account on the day of the crime, escaped to New Zealand on the second day of the crime with his wife, Jung (33) and her two daughters, who were two months old and aged 2 to 7 months, to live. Kim, who was deported on July 11 after 80 days of refuge, claimed in a police investigation that, "" I accidentally committed a crime during an argument, and my wife did not participate in the crime. "" As personal information was revealed when Kim was arrested, the police did not plan to provide the face masks and hats that they usually provided to suspects for future inspections at the scene. Kim, who appeared at the eastern police station in Yongin before going through a physical examination for a warrant, hid his face completely in a mask with a baseball cap and hood. "" We believe the methods are brutal, such as the murder of his biological mother and a younger brother with deadly weapons, and the damage from the crime is significant, "" a police officer said. We will concentrate on questioning Kim`s planned crime and whether or not his wife had colluded with him during further investigations, he added. The current special law on the punishment of a certain violent crime enables the investigating body to request personal information such as the face of a suspect and the name of the person concerned in case of a certain violent crime, such as murder, sex, drug, inducement, robbery, or violence. In order to disclose the identity of suspects, ▲, the means of crime, and the occurrence of serious damages ▲, the evidence that a suspect committed a crime, ▲, the right to know, and the right to know, and the need for crime prevention. Case concerning the disclosure of the suspect's personal information is suspect Kim Hak-bong, murder victim of a mountain climber at Suraksan Mountain in Seoul in 2016, murder suspect Lee Seong-woo, murder suspect of a murder victim in Daebudo, Kyonggi Province, and a daughter of a golf practice house in Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province last year. you@yna.co.kr The problem's flaws are separate from the security vulnerabilities of Intel's earlier chip, which has turned out to be fatal flaws in only 10 days at Intel, which has controlled 80 percent of the global market. Finnish Cyber Security company F Secure issued a statement on the last 12 (local time) and announced that it could detect a security vulnerability defect in an Intel firmware technology called Active Management Technology (AMT), which is about 30 minutes away. As a result, millions of laptops around the world that use AMT were exposed to potential security risks, and once hackers broke in, they could disable not only access to computer data, but also secure encryption barriers to operating system (OS) security devices. AMT is a multI-year enterprise program that allows the IT department to remotely manage personal computers and has been used by countries, including Korea. The security team explained that the latest defect enables hackers with physical access to the computer to operate the computer without authorization by penetrating the control program BIOS. Especially, if a hacker digs a single device, it could penetrate the entire company's AMT business, according to F Secure. Harry Shintonen, Senior Security Advisor, who discovered the flaw, said, "" This case can be incredibly disruptive, "" adding, "" Even with maximum security, the laptops can be controlled by hackers. "" Fault in question is unlike the security defect in Intel semiconductor chips that were found earlier this month, ' Meltdown ' or ' Spectre, ' experts say, and F found last July. Sintonen was concerned that "" security measures such as disk encryption, local firewalls and malware might not be able to avoid problems with these deficiencies, "" and strongly warned companies and warned them that it would be necessary to disable them. AFP reported that Intel expressed its gratitude for the experts ' explanation of the incident. Intel spokesman strongly recommends "" maximum system security for vendors, "" saying, "" system manufacturers are regularly delivering our guidance to ensure the best information needed to secure their data. "" Intel, however, has begun to fan its already widespread discontent with another security glitch in just 10 days. It has been revealed that in the United States, group lawsuits against Intel started on July 4 and at least 12 cases have been filed until July 10. The plaintiffs are spreading to California, New York, and Illinois throughout the U.S. and are demanding compensation for consumer damages due to security breaches. Intel shareholders, in particular, have joined a class action suit, claiming that the stock price plummeted due to an inadequate response, causing Intel Gate to spread throughout the company. Law Firm Rosen Law Firm, who filed class action suits against shareholders, said Intel's statements regarding the Meltdown and Spector deficiencies were flawed and that Apple's stock price was misleading and misproved the truth. Intel shares, which were valued at more than $ 46.8 on July 2, began to drop sharply in the wake of a chip defect and plunged to $ 43.2 on July 12, falling 7.7 percent. ]newglass@yna.co.kr The festival, selected as the representative festival of the Republic of Korea for the fifth year in a row, will continue until July 28.News 1, 2008 ; News 1 ; Hong Seong-woo (Hwacheon = News 1) ; The Hwacheon Sancheoneo Festival is showing a brisk performance.

"When it comes to separating the domestic wealthy from the financial assets of the wealthy, by separating the financial institutions from the general public, by which about one or three percent of their assets are not invested, "" the wealthy, asset managers of banks are not necessarily interested in password money, "" said Kim. Meanwhile, young people in their 20s and 30s see encrypted money as an investment asset. According to the app analyst firm Wise App, the highest number of users of Bitcone was in their 30s, or 32.7 percent. This is 20 to 24 percent and 40 to 21 percent, respectively. Only 15 percent of those in their 50s or older. Kwon Soon-won, business school professor at Sookmyung Women's University in Seoul, said, "" Young people who are deeply concerned about the future because of the lack of jobs have lost their sense of deprivation of relative importance relative to their older generations who will enjoy the fruits of growth. "" Yoon In-jin, a sociology professor at Korea University, also said, As the perception that it is increasingly difficult to make large sums of money using traditional investment assets such as stocks and real estate has become popular, encrypted homes with high return on investment are popular. Stock experts are concerned that the market is too overheated for the encrypted money technology. Upon hearing on July 11 that the government was considering scrapping the encryption currency exchange, Bitcone's price has recovered to 20 million won in two days from its plunge to 17.5 million won. Shares of encrypted money listed on the stock market are also pouring in. Korean investment in technology, which owns two shares of the Korea Cryptocode Exchange, jumped 1346 percent in the past three months. Bitcone fever is similar to the tulip bubble that swept the Netherlands in the 1630`s, said Lee Jong-woo, head of IBK Investment & Securities Research Center. The price of tulips then rose nearly fifty-fold in a month and quickly plummeted to thousands when the court ruled it could not recognize the importance of tulips. As Bitcoin is also pushing up the price with investors flocking to the crowd, when it cuts off, it could cause a bubble in a moment, Lee said. Some say the technology of cipher money and block chains should be separated. Although the technology of the block chain underlying encryption bills is very useful, the encryption facility can hardly replace the existing ones, said Kim Hak-kyun, a senior researcher at Mirae Asset Daewoo. In a report released on July 11 by Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse, the "" bit coin was not a means to trade or pay "" but an "" asset to analyze the market, in which 4 % of all transactions were made. Experts advised investors to invest in cipher currency but they said it should be limited to small funds. One private banker (private private) who requested anonymity said, "" Even young people around me often pay attention to encrypted currency. "" "" Don't invest more than one percent of their financial assets in terms of building up their investment portfolio. "" Hwang`s private banking unit also requested that we should be able to keep track of the market properly when we invest the money ourselves, but we will make it easy to avoid losing any money. However, most PBs were "" not interested by customers "" and did not invest because of the high risk of return. "" There are also concerns over investing in cipher money abroad. As a result of a survey conducted by Credit Facility research firm RAND EDU, 18 percent of Bitcone investors bought Bitcons with credit cards, 20 percent of whom went bankrupt due to a lack of funds. CNBC said that to avoid stress from a sudden decline in the price of encrypted money, investors would have lost sight of the price. "" If you're still holding the better bit coins you purchased 10 years ago, "" Edelman's founder and CEO, Rick Edelman, said, "" and you're seeing a sharp rise in investment, from $ 1 to $ 1000.

They want to induce a soft landing by allowing the virtual currency market to remain as it is, and gradually releasing the balloon's wind under the reality that a burst of inflated balloon could seriously damage society. The presidential office's policy committee in charge of controlling the issue, however, looks at virtual currency transactions with a major emphasis on speculation. A senior presidential official said in a telephone call on July 13 that the government`s stance is true to say that virtual currency is heavily weighted by speculation, It is not to say that the younger generation is entering the arena as usual. One of the main reasons Cheong Wa Dae sees the virtual currency boom as a speculation is what it calls the kimchi premium. Kimchi premium means that the same virtual currency is traded at a higher price in korea than in other countries. Prior to the government's measures to curb virtual currency transactions, the premium for kimchi reached 60 percent. It is abnormal for anyone to see kimchi premiums of 30-40 percent, a high-ranking official said, One can not help but say that the participation itself is overheated. We should normalize even the premium for kimchi. As a result, although 88 % of the most popular virtual currency, Bitcone, one percent, is at risk of losing money when only 10 % of its shares are released to the market, the loss of 3 million people in this case is so great.Recognizing virtual currency as being a type of speculative, "" bomb spinning, "" the presidential office is very carefully considering measures to induce a soft landing. Rather than prick the needle on an inflated balloon at a time, it is placed at a point where the air hole is left open and the balloon is compressed and the balloon size is reduced. Cheong Wa Dae explained that the establishment of a special law to abolish the virtual currency exchange, which was unveiled on July 11 by Justice Minister Park Sang-kee, is also one of the measures to make the market soft. A senior official said, Even if the exchange bill is proposed, it will have to go through parliamentary discussion and if it is approved by the National Assembly, it will take some time to get out of the process before it takes effect. We believe that as we go through this process, investors will gradually fall apart and move toward normalization. However, it is unclear whether the cancellation of the virtual currency exchange can actually be submitted to the National Assembly. After Minister Park's remarks, the opposition party expressed clear opposition to the deal, and the ruling party seems to feel burdened. Public opinion on the abolition of the exchange is not good either. More than 1,000 people opposed the cancellation of the exchange on July 12 alone, and 122,000 people participated in the petition as of May 13 as of 5 p.m. on the same day. The fact that virtual currency investors are mostly in their 20s and 30s is a burden on Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling party. This is because many of them overlap with the supporters of the incumbent administration. It is also feared that a considerable portion of the support base may be dislodged before the June local elections. Even within Cheong Wa Dae, many people are opposed to the abolition of the virtual currency exchange. It is not only too aggressive a regulation, but the opposition party is in reality clear to object. The ruling party is also reluctant to pass the National Assembly. Given such public opinion, it is questionable whether Cheong Wa Dae will accept the ministry's proposal, which is all about scrapping the entire deal. The ministry, not only the ministry, but also the Financial Services Commission and the Science and Technology Information and Communication Ministry are creating regulations to regulate virtual currency transactions, an official at the Justice Ministry said. Meanwhile, Cheong Wa Dae has held meetings with related ministries, such as the Strategy and Finance Ministry, the Ministry of Justice, the Financial Services Commission, the Fair Trade Commission, and the Ministry of Information and Communication, and will review virtual currency measures soon. It is also possible that the Ministry of Justice may revise its plan to secure a legal basis to scrap the stock exchange rather than fully abolishing it. kind3@yna.co.kr"
"Change real name without exception if you want to conversion…Free the source of deposits on existing accounts … careful review of payment prevention (Seoul=Communist news) = If a user asks for a payment in case of a blocked withdrawal, he or she checks the virtual currency (password) by using a virtual currency (password) So-called hornets, which control the transactions of multiple dealers under corporate accounts in book form, are cut off from sources. The Financial Services Commission announced on July 14 that it has follow-up measures on virtual currency and other measures to compensate for the situation. "" We have taken steps to ensure that transactions are avoided as long as possible by the current legal framework as it takes to ban virtual currency transactions, "" said a financial authorities ' official, "" with the Bank of Korea's checking and struggling its lines with its real-name bank. "" To maximize the efficiency of the real-name bank system being implemented by financial authorities, virtual currency dealers using virtual accounts have been allowed to sign off as often as possible. Existing accounts will be reduced by just withdrawal from the bank, and if they refuse to change their real names within a certain period, they will be fined or fined. For example, when the real-name financial transaction system was enforced in 1993, up to 60 % of financial assets were fined if their real names were not changed within the due date. Financial authorities are reportedly considering limiting the withdrawal of bank accounts that refuse to follow the real-name procedure. This has a strong effect on preventing the conversion of virtual currency into cash, but the financial authorities are also careful to introduce the bill because it could violate property rights. Separately, a transaction account may be automatically cleared after the virtual account supply contract period ends between the commercial bank and the exchange. While blocking existing virtual accounts, the so-called ' honeycomb account ', which had balloon effect, was cut off. A honeycomb account is a virtual account (hornets account) of virtual currency transactions disguised as an operating fund account of a corporation. Late exchanges have been operating illegally by writing down transactions made by multiple dealers under the bank account after receiving a general corporate account, and since they are known to have multiple money laundering properties, hacking situations, and other situations have complicated financial situations. Financial authorities have decided to issue a guideline to stop bank accounts that capture frequent transactions between individuals under corporate accounts, as they are easier for banks to catch.The virtual account of the chairman of the Financial Services Commission Choi Jong-gu is a type of corporate account in which businesses requiring a large collection or transfer are granted by the bank to identify individual customer transactions. There is no real name verification procedure as the issuing and managing of individual virtual accounts is carried out by businesses, not banks. The real-name bank service that the government introduces at the end of this month allows traders to deposit only their real name account and the same bank account of a virtual currency handler. As the identity of the trader is revealed in the process, it is effective in establishing foreign residents in virtual currency exchange market. In addition, basic data will be generated to impose virtual currency transaction taxes, and additional measures will be possible such as setting the limit of transactions per capita in the future. Through a real name verification, we will gradually draw virtual currency transactions into the drawing rights, allowing the balloons to breathe out of the market, said a financial regulator. speed@yna.co.kr"
"This is the key agenda item that has been pursued by the Korean Peninsula and East Asian countries for more than 20 years since the 1990s when suspicions arose that nuclear reactors in Yongbyon, North Korea were operating at the same level. The international community tried and failed to lead North Korea to denuclearization by using all means except for military sanctions, pressures, dialogue and economic aid. As the denuclearization issue failed to make progress, the international community and the North Korea relationship improvement failed to take place. Unification Minister Cho Myung-kyun (left) and his head of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland exchange a joint statement at the South Korean House for Peace on July 9. The inter-Korean relationship was the same. Improving the inter-Korean relationship should be accompanied by easing military tension. One example is the fact that inter-Korean relations improvement strategies through economic cooperation, such as the Gaesong Industrial Complex and Mt. Kumgang tours, have shown limitations due to North Korea's nuclear tests and ballistic missile provocations. At the high-level meeting between the two Koreas held at the truce village of Panmunjeom on July 9, the two sides sent out a joint press statement on the day of the summit, including Pyeongchang Olympics ' participation in North Korea. North Korea`s chief delegate, Li Sun-kwon, however, raised strong dissatisfaction over the mention of denuclearization at the end of the talks, signaling that the denuclearization issue will become a major obstacle for future talks between the two Koreas.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who leads the nuclear weapons and weapons programs, took charge of the program, was reported by the Korean Central News Agency on September 3 last year. A sign behind Kim said, "" The nuclear warheads on Hwasung-14, believed to be North Korea's ICP-14. "" The reason why North Korea is obsessed with nuclear weapons is because it provides a shield and window to the regime, and provides the impetus to lead the Korean Peninsula. It is literally a universal goblin bat.No country would wage a war against a country with nuclear weapons. No matter how strong the conventional forces are, such as tanks, armored vehicles, and fighter jets, they become helpless in the face of nuclear threats. Having a ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead makes nuclear power stronger. If the ballistic missile with nuclear warheads is dropped in an area deep behind the enemy, the enemy can defeat its ability and willingness to conduct the war. North Korea has developed nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICP-15) that have the right to deploy U.S. mainland as part of its strategy to block U.S. intention to intervene in a war on the Korean Peninsula.Nuclear weapons and the maintenance of the system are closely correlated. The Center for Strategic and Budget Assessment (CSBA), a U.S. think tank, in a 2008 study said that "" the 20-kiloton nuclear warheads imposed on Hiroshima during World War II and the threat of liquid fuel missiles could only be raised in the U.S. ""Many similar cases were found in the Middle East wars during the Cold War. Egypt, which lost the Sinai Peninsula to Israel in 1967, attacked Israel in October 1973, waging a war. Externally, he declared all-out war by saying, "" I'll get Israel off the map, "" but in reality, it was a limited war to get the Sinai Peninsula back. Israel had mistaken it for an all-out war and feared a nuclear attack against Egypt. However, he lost without being able to stop Israel's counterattack, as the Egyptian army bound itself to the hands and feet.When the U.S. and South Korea allies attack North Korea according to an operational plan 5015, North Korea can drop nuclear weapons on top of the U.S. and South Korean allies if Kim Jong-un is threatened. Because of these threats, the United States can not apply the 5027 plan to capture North Korea or overthrow the Kim Jong-un system. U.S. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Rex Tillerson said on July 13, We don`t seek a regime change or collapse. In a dialogue with China, we said we would come back beyond the 38th Parallel, ' he said, adding, "" It is also an admission of North Korea`s nuclear weapons program.Nuclear weapons are a strategic weapon that allows North Korea to take the lead in inter-Korean relations. Nuclear weapons are the best tool to shake South Korea against North Korea, which lags behind South Korea in most areas such as economic and international influence. As soon as North Korea thinks it can not make a preemptive strike against a nuclear weapon, the initiative goes to North Korea. In other words, both provocation and dialogue are options for North Korea to make. Seoul can hardly escape its uneasy position because it can only sharpen its anti-handy tactics to counter North Korea's moves. North Korea is believed to be speeding up its drilling activities in the tunnels west of the nuclear test site to conduct nuclear tests. ▽ U.S. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LA NL) = Nuclear test expert Frank Fabian and others were shown at the entrance to North Korea's China's China Space Agency on October 11 (local time), which was recently photographed by North Korea's expert media. Yonhap news agency said, "" The denuclearization of North Korea is for communication purposes, not for the start, "" adding, "" North Korea has no intention of giving up nuclear weapons because they are aimed at the United States. "" In his New Year's message on July 1, North Korean Workers ' Party Chairman Kim Jong-un said, "" We must always deploy nuclear warheads and ballistic rockets to ensure that the nuclear weapons research department and rocket industries maintain their strength and reliability "" Chairman of the Committee on North Korea`s nuclear weapons, Cho Pyung-chun, also criticized the denuclearization issue during the talks, saying, All of our high-tech strategic arms are aimed at the United States thoroughly right after the inter-Korean high-level talks on July 9.North Korea is using an inter-Korean track strategy to separate its nuclear weapons and inter-Korean relations with the Pyeongchang Olympics as a first consideration. The New Year's message and the results of high-level talks are considered to demonstrate North Korea's track strategy with little or no adjustments. Moon Sung-mook, head of the Center for National Strategy Research, said in response to the New Year message and the outcome of high-level talks, We can cooperate with the South on dialogue, improvement of relations and the Pyeongchang Olympics. So do not mention the nuclear weapons. Soldiers from the 6th Brigade of the Marine Corps landing on the ground landing site of the Northwest Islands Defense Drill Service in Baengnyeong Island, Ongjin County, Incheon, on September 7, 2006. Incheon : Yonhap news agency, facing North Korea's track strategy, is in a quandary for the Korean government. We will deal with the United States on the nuclear issue, as seen by the South Korean public. The demand for denuclearization, especially those brought by conservative groups in Korea, can not be ignored. It is also a burden to urge North Korea to return to the six-party talks or to engage in dialogue with the U.S. Under these circumstances, the government needs sophisticated strategies toward North Korea. If North Korea reacts by separating the nuclear weapons from the inter-Korean relationship, the government should adopt a strategy that is appropriate. Of course, the goal of denuclearization must be maintained and something to say to the North in the course of inter-Korean dialogue. However, if the North mentions denuclearization from the beginning stage of the negotiations, it is at risk that talks in all areas, including the economy and culture, will be stopped.If the talks are discontinued, North Korea is likely to resume military provocations, resulting in the U.S.'s military option against the North, and the situation on the Korean Peninsula could be rapidly aggravated. The two Koreas and the United States should discuss North Korea's nuclear program together after stabilizing the Korean Peninsula, linking the results of inter-Korean talks with North Korea by making the most of the dialogue that started at the Pyeongchang Olympics.The issue of denuclearization of North Korea is not an issue that should end with a single negotiation or dialogue. This is an advanced equation that could not be solved by sanctions, pressure, and dialogue in any way due to an age-old problem that has been involved for over 25 years. As it takes time to solve complicated mathematical formulas, the denuclearization of North Korea should go a long way. You need patience to complete this road. First of all, the Pyeongchang Games should be held successfully and peacefully, and then resolve denuclearization, peace agreements and military tensions from a long-term perspective. North Korean delegates cross the Military Demarcation Line on July 9, including Ri Sun-kwon, head of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, to attend high-level inter-Korean talks held at the South Korean Peace House. ▽ Panmunjeom : It is the political institution that insists that "" ask North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program "" whenever the joint photo negotiation group opens, and that argument should be dealt with in a dialogue with North Korea is the responsibility of the political delegation. As soon as our representatives at the truce village of Panmunjeom worried about, ' What kind of a decline would we face if we returned to Seoul without mentioning the denuclearization issue at the conference hall? ', it is not a topic of political dialogue. Will the South-North dialogue, which is held under such circumstances, proceed properly? The only repeat of the vicious cycle of dialogue _ provocation → sanctions and pressure. Park Geun-hye from the government from North Korea to resume conversation with difficulty that we have completely blocked situation to say and want to do, that there is no wonder. However, putting all of the pending issues between the two Koreas on the negotiation table at once is tantamount to eating them because they are hungry. The government should secure the momentum for negotiation and gradually move toward denuclearization by smoothly carrying out the dialogue. Perseverance and patience are the biggest virtues of North-South relations. That is why we should keep in mind the old saying, "" A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

Apartments with only the same floor and low floor will face a price reduction of 550 million won at the end of the year.The price of 84 ㎡ in the Shinsangwon-dong Noble Park in Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province was traded at 411 million won (4-4 million U.S. dollars) in May last year, but dropped nearly 150 million won in November because of the higher floor price.The one-side-only 127 ㎡ of Hanwa Ggumegreen, Nam-gu, Ulsan, was traded at 440 million won last October, but in November, it fell by more than 40 million won to 450 million won.■ Measures need to be taken to consider both the Seoul and local housing market, the government recently announced a tax reform that would reduce local low-price housing from an estimated transfer income tax and multiple homeowners. However, experts say that as the volume of new apartments is scheduled to be built in the provinces this year, additional housing prices are expected to fall, and that local housing market needs to be stabilized. The government is trying too hard to regulate the housing market in Seoul, which means it is negligent of its balanced approach to the overall housing market.According to Real Estate 114, the volume of housing in Busan is expected to jump to 23,193 this year, more than last year's 10,994 households. In Ulsan, 8590 households, similar to last year's (9892 households), move in this year. In Gyeongnam Province, 30,985 households, similar to last year's (36,155 households), are about to move in.Real estate researcher Kim Kyu-jung at NH Investment & Securities Co. said, Since the second half of last year, apartment prices have continued to fall, mostly in South Gyeongsang and Busan. Due to the large supply this year, we are concerned about the possibility of unsold units, said a preliminary inspection of unsold units, which may be problematic but not serious in the long run.As the government should excessively tighten regulations on the Seoul area, including Gangnam, the major housing market, the overall housing market should be reviewed more severely, said Shim Gyo-eong, a professor at Konkuk University, as the loan market could experience a decline.jyyoun@fnnews.com"
"Manto Touday Namgung Min.Honey!Since its opening in 1987, the agency has been torturing pro-democracy activists during the military dictatorship, and since 2005, it has been used as the National Security and Human Rights Administration's losing center. / Photo = "" I heard the news 1, "" "" I lost the king's seat in Namyeong-dong, I didn't even know if I looked like this. I couldn't say anything … "" (Visitors ' Jeong-cheol Park Jong-cheol, a subway station worker, and left on the 31st. The black brick building boasted its presence even among the skyscrapers around it. It is the loss of the government's air force in Namyeong-dong, where the crackdown on pro-democracy activists took place during the military dictatorship. The loss of air defense in Namyeong-dong, which was built by Kim Soo-geun, the nation's top architect in 1976, was underscored by the name of ` OO Ocean Research & Development Institute ` as the place where torture against pro-democracy activists ended in the 1970s and 1980s. It was then used as a security loss under the National Police Agency, and has been operated as a center for human rights since 2005.◇ After watching a movie, the whole family went up to Seoul. … The number of visitors increased by 10 times. After watching the movie ' 1987, ' the whole family watched the movie together, and they went to Seoul with Oh EuI-wan to see the loss of the surrounding building. / Photo : "" I received a pass from Namgung Min's press office, and six people came in. The film, titled ` 1987, ` about the June democratic uprising that followed the fatal killing spree of adviser Park Jong-cheol, recently had about 10 visitors a day. Since the building is famous for the works of Kim Soo-keun, architects used to visit it, said an official at the National Human Rights Center of the National Police Agency.History Hall and Public Information Hall are located on the first floor of the building, Human Rights Educators Hall of Education and Exhibition Room for Park Jong-cheol on the fourth floor. The middle-aged man I met in the Park Jong-cheol Memorial Hall read the newspaper when they told me about the murder of the torture, and the children holding their parents ' hands looked at the monument with curious eyes. Kim Tae-wan (42), who came from Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province the day before, said, I saw the movies and books, and the whole family wanted to know more, so I was scared of them.Back Gate, where the accused were sent to the investigating room, is connected to a spiral staircase. It is not currently used. / Photo : Spiral staircase leading directly from the first floor of Namgung's journalist to the fifth floor. After arriving in Josa Temple, the suspect is not even sure which floor he is on. If you enter the back gate of Namgung Min journalist building, you will see a spiral staircase leading directly to the fifth floor. Those who were dragged up the stairs without knowing what floor they were going to. When they reached the end of the long spiral staircase, they were severely tortured. Most of the investigating rooms have changed so much that they can not see the traces of the time, but the number 509, which was killed by the martyr, Park Jong-cheol, has been preserved in a similar manner. All the households in the investigation room lost to the public were shut down to prevent caniners from cutting themselves. Namgung Min-Namgoong Reporter-The bathtub used for water torture is located inside Namgung Min. The desks and chairs that have been questioned are bolted to the floor to prevent cutting themselves. The walls, which were surrounded by anti-sounding walls, were blocked from the low notes that were heard in each room, but the high notes were delivered as they were heard in order to amplify the screams. Especially, a window measuring 30cm wide was noticeable. The tortured abettor was made narrow to keep him from jumping out the window. Jeon Dae-bong (68), who has been around Room 509, said, "" I only vaguely told you what was going on here during my busy working hours. Citing the portrait of martyr Park Jong-cheol, Jun said, Such a student is rare, and history was made by these people.◇ It is too bad to manage the showroom and education center … The lost public building in Namyeong-dong, formerly known as "" Give back to the citizens "" is currently being used as the National Police Agency human rights center. However, it was difficult to obtain information because there were no outstanding notices or managers. ▽ Photo = Namgung Min-gi Yeo-Hae (Nam-gung-min) : I missed seeing the loss of the king's plane. No guide was found at the exhibition or education center. No explanation was left in the investigating room on the fifth floor, so visitors were searching for information using smartphones. Most of the information on memorial halls is not provided by the official Web site of the National Police Agency's human rights center, but by the Park Jong-chul Memorial Association.As a result, a petition movement to restore the loss of the former national defense in Namyeong-dong under the control of the police is being encouraged. On July 2, the Park Jong-Cheol Memorial Service posted a petition on the Presidential petition page, which included expanding the democratic display facility in Namyeong-dong, former South Korean president of Namyeong, and setting up an advisory healing center. The petition received support from 7,183 citizens as of midnight on July 14.Regarding this, National Police Agency Director Lee Chul-seong said, "" If the bereaved families ' families ' families ' memorial services are consulted on and the memorial services were to be consummated by the National Human Rights Center on July 13, the families ` committee will advise on the decision to allow such a case to be carried outThe senior prosecutor in charge of real time news, and the senior prosecutor in charge of real time, reported on July 14 that the nation's top civil rights watchdog had announced ` Fundamentag News ` and ` The National Intelligence Service is now receiving free comic and free gifts `. Most noticeable is that the agency has officially declared the establishment of an intelligence agency (tentatively named "" safe guard "") in the police department by handing over the power of the NIS to the police. The NIS has also engaged in special investigation into the government's right to collect information at home and abroad and in the planning and coordination of all intelligence agencies, "" said a senior presidential secretary for civil affairs who allegedly engaged in the election by taking advantage of the authority of special judges ' authority. Cho pointed out that the NIS should resign from its domestic political and anti-Communist investigations and be reborn as a top-class professional intelligence agency for the people and the nation, concentrating solely on gathering information from the North. The anticommunist investigative police transferred to the Moon Jae-in is a public pledge of the president. Under the previous administration, the NIS has ruled out a series of high-profile criminal cases by engaging in presidential and local elections, and by designating the government agents as being behind the scandal, as being involved in a series of accusations against the government. Kim Byung-gi, secretary general of the National Assembly Intelligence Committee, proposed four cases of the bill, including the revision of the NIS Law. Kim's proposal includes the NIS's responsibility for collecting intelligence information for the first time up to the investigation stage, but the investigation is transferred to the police. The prosecution's arbitrary investigation into political interests, which has denied the right to indict, was also included in its plan to reform the authorities. "" The prosecution has a great deal of power over its own investigations, over its own power to command the police, over its own brothers, "" Cho said, "" and the power of the prosecution to abuse is not properly controlled. "" The prosecution will deal a role by separating prosecutors ` rights to investigate and controlling prosecutors ` activities, including adjusting their investigative rights, transferring high-ranking officials to the post, reducing their own investigation except for special cases, and focusing on prosecutors ` investigation activities. Police who take over the NIS's counterintelligence function have warned of the introduction of the local police system, as they are worried about a possible power surge. "" Police have not only the power to investigate more than 100,000 people nationwide, but also the power to provide information, security and security "" Cho said, adding, "" The power of operation will be heavily policed by the government to seriously reform and to ensure that the operation of the public is highly effective. "" To that end, the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae plans to establish an independent organization in the police force, tentatively named Ahn Bo-soo, to take over the NIS's control over the investigation and to guarantee the professionalism and responsibility of the investigation. In addition, the government plans to divide the investigation police and the administrative police to spread the power of the police. It also plans to eliminate public concern about the non-controlling police force by enhancing the status of police committees that even civilians participate.The announcement made by the head of the National Defense Agency on this day was meaningful in that it confirmed the government's initiative. In addition, Cheong Wa Dae reaffirmed its thorough breach of the previous administration's evils and its reform drive. Police are also planning to look into whether the death of farmer Baek Nam-gi and the police's appropriateness in suppressing the accidents of the Miryang Songjeon Tower, Jejungjeong Village, Ssangyong Motors, and Yongsan Fire & Marine Insurance. Prosecutors plan to organize a fact-finding team after reviewing the case under investigation.▶ Chatting 1:1 with reporters ; no reproduction or redistribution of any of the major visual news stories violet199575@gmail.com directly edited by Nocut News"
"[NEWS DESKTOP] ◀ anchorer ▶ has decided to be followed up by the government to confirm the real name of the account.Local banks are expected to have a real-name checking service available as early as next week, requiring about 3 million dealers to switch their passwords to the identified accounts.This is a reporter for Kim Jang-hoon. ◀ Report. There are six banks that are in the process of deploying a real-name verification service for virtual currency transaction : Kookmin, Shinhan, Hana, National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, Enterprise, and Gwangju Bank.The banks are scheduled to announce the date of service later this week."" Each bank is in the final stages and we expect it to start operating as early as the 22nd, "" said a Financial Services Commission official.The target audience is about three million, and the key to real-name services is that dealers should trade in their real names accounts and synchronize the accounts on the bank and on the virtual currency exchange.The problem has been that when the money is received from the exchange, it is impossible to know who the deposit is if it is sent from another bank.[Finality Chairman (last 8 days)]] "" If the virtual account services of a bank whose real name is not verified, the bank will promote the distribution of crime and illegal funds.Whether you're a new or an existing dealer, you're not.Unlike deposits, however, withdrawals due to the need to send money to a real-name account would allow existing dealers to make withdrawals from different bank accounts.Instead, the "" honeycomb account "", which has been designated as the escape to verify the real name, is locked off from the source.The honeycomb account is not allowed in terms of individuals who are blind to their real names in corporate accounts, but in the form of book transactions, which means that the real-name system would be blurred.The purpose of the real-name virtual currency transaction system is to monitor the transaction process and designate a party for taxing the return on transactions.In that sense, it is still a challenge to keep tabs on person-to-individuals transactions or transactions via an overseas exchange.This is Kim Jang-hoon in MBC news. Kim Jang-hoon Copyright (cooldude@mbc.co.kr [Copyright reserved for MBC (www.imnews.com) So-called hornets, which control the transactions of multiple dealers under corporate accounts in book form, are cut off from sources. The Financial Services Commission announced on July 14 that it has follow-up measures on virtual currency and other measures to compensate for the situation. "" We have taken steps to ensure that transactions are avoided as long as possible by the current legal framework as it takes to ban virtual currency transactions, "" said a financial authorities ' official, "" with the Bank of Korea's checking and struggling its lines with its real-name bank. "" The official said, "" If we fail to change the real name of the company within a certain time limit when the real-name policy was enforced in 1993, we gave various penalties, such as fines, to those who don`t respond to the real-name verification. "" Financial authorities have allowed virtual currency traders through virtual accounts to complete the real-name verification process, preferably without exception, to maximize the efficiency of the real-name verification system that takes effect later this month. It is said that it intends to embrace as many virtual currency traders as possible into the real-name system. The bank decided to ban deposits on existing accounts and allow only withdrawals. The purpose of the bank is to block the inflow of funds into existing accounts that can respond to the real-name accounts or leave the virtual currency market but can not be verified by using their real names. If the government refuses to change the real name within a certain period of time, the current law will impose more penalties. This means that the transaction using existing accounts will be restricted so that existing dealers can go through the real-name process. The exchange is also under pressure to operate two computer systems, the existing system and the real-name system, so it is highly likely to induce customers to use the real-name system. Financial authorities say they are also considering imposing fines on accounts that refuse to confirm their real names, but as it is a matter of revision, they have a long way to go before enforcing the law. Separately, a transaction account may be automatically cleared after the virtual account supply contract period ends between the commercial bank and the exchange. While blocking existing virtual accounts, the so-called ' honeycomb account ', which had balloon effect, was cut off. A honeycomb account is a virtual account (hornets account) of virtual currency transactions disguised as an operating fund account of a corporation. Late exchanges have been operating illegally by writing down transactions made by multiple dealers under the bank account after receiving a general corporate account, and since they are known to have multiple money laundering properties, hacking situations, and other situations have complicated financial situations. Financial authorities have decided to issue a guideline to stop bank accounts that capture frequent transactions between individuals under corporate accounts, as they are easier for banks to catch.The real-name bank service introduced by Financial Services Commission Chairman Choi Jong-koo at the end of this month allows dealers to pay in the same bank accounts as the dealers ' real names and virtual currency handlers. As the identity of the trader is revealed in the process, it is effective in establishing foreign residents in virtual currency exchange market. In addition, basic data will be generated to impose virtual currency transaction taxes, and additional measures will be possible such as setting the limit of transactions per capita in the future. speed@yna.co.kr Even though the price of apartments has gone up 10 million won a day, there is no sale. Since the prices go up 150 million won in two months until they sign up and pay the balance, the owners won't sell it for now. So, the buyers are more likely to stick to it and the prices run their own way, "" an authorized broker in Jamsil, Seoul, said Monday of the skyrocketing housing prices in Gangnam. Gangnam housing prices, which did not fall last year despite real estate measures, have risen sharply this year, however, as purchasing only slowed down when various measures were adopted. The government failed to make the timing to control house prices, experts said.According to Korea Institute of Audit and Inspection statistics, prices of apartments in Gangnam increased 0.42 percent a week from the previous week, an increase from Jeonju (0.39 percent). Songpa ward saw the biggest increase in the nation, rising by 1.10 percent. Gangnam-gu also saw a 0.70 percent rise. House prices in Seoul rose 0.29 percent for the fourth straight week.The government has been trying to ignore the soaring housing prices in southern Seoul as being a local overheat. However, market watchers say the Gangnam reconstruction market is increasingly looking for the "" smarter "" market. In fact, housing prices in Seoul, other than the three districts of Gangnam, Seocho, Gangnam and Songpa, were clearly on the rise. The share of new households in the week increased by 0.77 percent, Seongdong by 0.40 percent, Gwangjin by 0.34 percent, and Mapo by 0.23 percent. The Seoul Trade Index Fluctuations Rate, a weekly map released by the Board of Audit and Inspection, displays a red color for districts with an increase of more than 0.5 percent. A month ago (Dec. 21, 2006), there were no red flags at all, but by this month, three areas - Gangnam, Songpa, and Yangcheon - were lit.It is clear that housing prices are on the rise in areas that are considered to be high investment values. Instead of spreading out into multiple homes, they tend to concentrate on compressed-investment investment at a time that would make money. If the investment gap between the local market and the local area is high, the investment gap between households and the poor is growing, said Park Won-gap, a real estate analyst at KB Kookmin Bank.Many predict that housing prices in Seoul will continue to rise for a while, especially in the Gangnam reconstruction market. The macroeconomic outlook is bright enough to predict a growth rate of around 3 percent this year, and the relationship between the two Koreas is in a very good shape. Market watchers expect the government will not introduce any regulations on property taxes until June local elections.The government is also facing growing worries. Although the government recently vowed to impose an eternal maximum crackdown on overheated property, the reaction of the market is chilly. The property tax, which will be discussed in full force soon, is likely to result in the tweezers policy on multiple or expensive home owners, but it has also been cited as a "" final card "" for the stabilization of housing. The market is the last reaction to the measures that have been put forward, a government official said. We should see how the market changes in April when the multiple home ownership tax system or rental housing database system is operating.But the current property price in Gangnam is the result of the government`s lukewarm policies, said one property expert who declined to be named, adding that the Gangnam reconstruction market is still worth the investment, and that it should not have strengthened the holding tax right after the new administration was inaugurated."
"▽ Successful Transformation with MultI-Class Systems…The domestic game industry, which had a disappointing fourth fiscal quarter, has seen its annual sales rise to two trillion won last year.According to the Lineage II Revolution on July 14, Nexon and Netmarble, which have not yet been officially counted, are estimated to have made between 500 billion won and 600 billion won per fiscal year last year. The cumulative sales of Nexon will reach 1.85 trillion won in the third quarter of last year, and Netmarble will reach 1.89 trillion won, both of which will soar to the middle of the second half of this year. Both companies are the highest performance since their inception. Depending on the sales figures for the fourth fiscal quarter, Netmarble could beat Nexon to become the game's champion. NCsoft, the first Korean company to post 1.2 trillion won in sales during the three quarters of last year, is also expected to generate close to 2 trillion won in sales in the fourth quarter. The quantitative growth in the gaming arena is attributed to a shift in the size of the multI-product system, with the successful release of many mobile games as the mobile game market matures. Netmarble and NCsoft saw a great deal of success when Lineage II and Lineage M, famous in Korea for their long films "" Lineage II "" were popular abroad. Nexon, which is also an online game-focused company, also launched a variety of mobile games last year, including Axe and Overhit, with its online and mobile gaming units doing well overseas.With Lineage M only being the fourth quarter performance, it is expected to slow down slightly from its original expectations. The daily sales of its Netmarble Lineage II Revolution fell to between 2 and 3 billion won abroad, falling short of expectations in November for North American and European advances, according to securities firms. The anticipated movie, Terra M, also spent a huge amount of money on marketing, but its initial performance has not continued. NC Soft Lineage is also worth 3 billion won, with its daily sales down 41 percent from the third quarter as a large number of its users leave the market in the first quarter. However, Lineage M released in Taiwan in mid-December last year has good sales of 2 billion to 3 billion won per day. "" The Lineage IP games that led the first half of last year decreased in popularity, and its marketing costs, so the business performance in the fourth quarter has shown a slower-than-expected pace this year, "" said Kim Dong-hee, an economist at Meritz Securities Co. "" Two companies are posting annual revenues of two trillion won, "" an official at the gaming industry said. "" It is a clear sign that game makers will grow in physical strength, "" adding, "" the trend towards launching a number of mobile games this year has shown that they will continue. "" srchae@yna.co.kr But it is not working ... "" The reporter whined but the umbrella did not open. It's been stuck in the can until now. The station worker looked on and laughed sadly. Someone borrowed it and gave it back, but it was not available for the next person.Incheon Transportation Corporation has been providing free umbrella services at subway stations for a long time. It is a system that lends money to and take it back to the passengers without umbrellas on rainy or snowy days. It is a ' honesty umbrella ' that has only been left to the conscience of the citizens.However, the umbrella recovery rate is virtually zero percent.The Seoul Transportation Corporation also suspended the service. We have lent umbrellas to former passengers, but now we understand they don`t do, an official at the corporation said.Where did the conscience umbrellas that were born as a result of donations from various social groups disappear?The rent book checked at the station said the name, address, and phone number of the tenant. The recent rental date was mid-December. Other Usan Mountain was nearly a month away from rent and return.It was difficult to verify the actual ID card, the station employee said. If the caller asks for an identity card to distinguish the authenticity of a name and telephone number, he or she is under fire for calling out ` believe it `. I have to lend my umbrella only on the information in the book.We need passengers to return it voluntarily, but we don`t do it, said an official at Incheon Transportation Authority.Many people point out the negative effects of the Chinese sharing economy, which faces a loss of goods due to lack of civic consciousness, but the same thing happened around China. Last April, the shared umbrella business, which started in 11 cities including Guangdong Province's Shenzhen and Shanghai, closed in about three months. That is because fewer of the 300,000 umbrellas were recalled and rarely found. Citizens borrowed it from the subway station or bus station and did not return it. A side effect of China's shared economy, represented by its lack of civic consciousness, was happening around us. When taking away the Chinese image of the yeast, one should be grateful but indifferent to the feelings of the time. Officials say they should endure the inconvenience and return it to other passengers, but few listened.Umbrella loans are the most common public services for civil convenience. Local governments lent and received umbrellas to the people who needed them, but as the number of people who returned grew less and less, they almost stopped running.A local government office in the Seoul Metropolitan area, which began to rent hundreds of umbrellas in the early 2000s, shut down its service after several years.The reason for this was that the tenant forgot to bring the umbrella with him or did not return it.Even local government officials are reportedly unable to remember when they have been discontinued.The Seoul Metropolitan Rapid Transit Corp. has recalled most of the umbrellas that it lent to citizens for free at the station, showing that the citizens ` consciousness grew a lot … Among them, about 1704 percent have borrowed so far ... Some passengers who have not returned their umbrellas were said to be sorry, "" Some of the subway umbrella recovery articles that one media reported more than 20 years ago. There is a noticeable improvement in civic consciousness. Now can we not even hope for something like that?Kim Dong-hwan, a reporter at kimcharr@segye.com ⓒ chat, a global media and world daily newspaper, immediately found. "" It is not training.

Donald Trump also began immediately informed of the state of false alarm, and authorities on the investigation, the president. Hawaiians and tourists all went to Hawaii on May 13 at 8:07 a.m. local time all told them, "" A ballistic missile threat coming to Hawaii. Find a shelter immediately.

Thirteen minutes later, however, Hawaii's State Emergency Management Agency (HEMA) immediately announced, "" There is no missile threat against Hawaii. "" Congressman Tulsey Garbard (Hawaii) followed by Twitter, "" That was a false alarm. We checked with the authorities and confirmed that no missiles were coming to Hawaii. The U.S. Defense Department and the Pacific Command also immediately announced that there were no ballistic missile threats. `` We did not detect any ballistic missile threats in Hawaii, '' a spokesman for the Pacific Command said on Twitter. Foreign news agencies, including the Associated Press, also simultaneously reported that the message of a ballistic missile threat warning was issued by mistake in Hawaii. Authorities and the media had reported misperception in only about 10 minutes, but after Hawaii was startled by North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile (ICP-2) and carried out an emergency drill last month, residents were immediately alerted to take off. Kim Young-ho (42), who was on vacation at a hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii, told Yonhap News Agency, I woke up suddenly and saw a loud alarm, and when I saw the message, I was surprised by the customers ` lobby. Everyone looked scared. Players who participated in the PGA Sony Open in Hawaii quickly evacuated due to a surprise. `` Please don't make the bomb threat real, '' John Fiderson wrote on Twitter. `` There's a wife and a baby under the mattress in the bath.

In Hawaii, the first practice was to evacuate residents who imagined North Korea's nuclear missile attack on July 1.

"Raising the Amount of Support to Hold Birth…Some local governments have had positive effects : 1,584 mothers who took out the support during the past five years…Take up a budget waste controversy (Yonhap news agency) last year : 58,000 people in Youngdong, Chungbuk Province. To be precise, the number of children born in the country who have been in a downward curve for the past 10 years has risen for the first time to return to 2013.It was caused by a huge increase in the childbirth grant from the illustration. The military has offered the first 3.5 million won, second 3.8 million won, third 5.1 million won, and the fourth or later 7.6 million won starting last year. The first and second incentives are the most in North Chungcheong Province. Last year, 127 and 94 children were born in the first and second offspring. Compared to 72 and 82 in 2016, the figure is a dramatic increase. Yeongdong-gun believes the first increase in the subsidy helped maintain the population to some extent. Some analyze that the number of children born each year could exceed 300 at best. However, it is not the right time to be blindly welcoming the increase of newborns. Of the mothers who gave birth to their children last year, 93 percent (37 percent) are new registrants who were registered as residents less than a year ago. In other words, they are likely to have falsely transferred to receive a maternity benefit. If they leave for another region after collecting their money, the policy to increase the population of Yeongdong-gun will be useless. They are paying only precious tax to the so-called "" flip-flap mother. "" Yeongdong-gun has been handing out maternity incentives for 20 to 30 months to prevent "" flop-flop. "" They are also considering extending the payment period after watching the trend. ◇ If the fertility rate can be raised … Each local government is desperate to increase its population as the competition for incentives falls. In many places, the children's incentives are competitively raised to pay more than 10 million won per month.Wando in South Jeolla Province is the country's largest birth-watching incentive. It pays the third and fourth 15 million won, the fifth 20 million won, the sixth 21 million won, and the seventh 22 million won. Cheongyang-gun, South Chungcheong Province, also gives 20 million won when their fifth child is born. Yeoju, Jeollabuk-do, Namwon and Changnyeong-gun were also offered 10 million won from the third, while Siheung in Gyeonggi-do and Goesan-gun in Chungbuk were given 10 million won. Last year, Seongnam City, Gyeonggi Province, had even adopted a policy to provide a bonus of more than 100 million won to those in the third place with a revision to the ordinance of a city council, resulting in a controversy over populism. However, the analysis differs on the effects of the incentives. Park Young-kyung, a sociology professor at Chungbuk National University, said, "" Although it is not known exactly how much incentives contribute to the birth rate, they can have a positive influence on young couples who worry about giving birth. "" However, instead of only providing short-term measures, policies should be found to improve the conditions of childcare and help women work and stay at home, Park stressed. Haenam-gun, South Jeolla Province is one of the most effective regions in giving birth to a baby. Since setting up the nation's first maternity task force in 2008, it has given an incentive of 3 million won, 3.5 million won, 6 million won, and 7.2 million won for the fourth and third child. Third, as a result of various support measures, including health insurance premium and ultrasound scan by pregnant women, the total fertility rate in 2016 was 2.42, ranking first among the cities, counties and districts nationwide. It is the first time in five consecutive years.▽ Raising One Child 〓 The issue of the childbirth rate plummeted … However, Jinan County, Jeollabuk-do failed to raise the childbirth incentive from 1.2 million won to 4.5 million won in 2016, and the subsidy was raised to 4.5 million won. The number of children born in the region dropped from 196 in 2015 to 176 last year and 147 last year. Cheongyang-gun, Chungnam Province, which raised the maximum amount of childbirth incentives to 20 million won since 2015, saw a decrease from 170 in 2015 to 135 in the following year and 121 last year. As the high cost of childbirth has emerged, controversy over the "" megaflood "" that takes only money and then leaves for other regions has grown. According to data released by the Jeolla Council last year, 1,584 "" dodgers "" have left the country in five years after receiving maternity benefits from 22 cities and counties in South Jeolla Province. The childbirth grant from the cities and counties in South Jeolla Province during this period was 73.115 billion won. Woo Seung-hee, the head of the Jeolla Provincial Council, said, We found limitations in population measures depending on incentives such as providing bribes, adding, The overall support for the growth process is needed, including childcare and education. Some local governments are even stopping providing childbirth incentives because they believe that the financial burden is greater than the effect of population growth. Sokcho City removed the incentive package, which was given second with 1.2 million won and third with 3.6 million won or higher in 2015. That is why the birth rate does not rise. The number of births in the region has decreased to 694 in 2010, 643 in 2012, 609 in 2014 and 537 in 2016. Last year, 385 were born and raised. Rather than stopping the ineffective childbirth grant, we have prepared supplementary measures to provide up to 400,000 won in health checks, childbirth reserves and post-natal care, said a city official. bgipark@yna.co.kr and inquiry, 1:1 chatting with reporters and iOS 11.2.2 Update of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics ' competition results in degraded performance.IT professional media Gismodo et al on July 12 (local time) stated that the iPhone 6 experienced a maximum performance penalty of 40 % after being tested on iOS 11.2.2 for ' Meltdown ' and ' Spector ' security vulnerabilities patch.Apple distributed updates to iOS 11.2.2 earlier this week and recommends installing them on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch to help prevent security breaches.

Ahn immediately announced that the committee will convene its 11th executive committee meeting to discuss the urgent proposal. The committee will hold a closed-door meeting at 3:00 p.m. on July 15 at its headquarters to discuss revisions to the party rules proposed by the JunvI Committee. The commission is expected to revise the rules to strip members of their posts, calling them `` paper party members '' and `` ghost party members, '' who can not be notified of the convention. This is interpreted as a move to increase the voting rate for the group with about 10,000 delegates representing the group. It is a stop-gap measure to fill a quorum of votes or more and pass a unified agenda. In particular, in case Chairman Lee Sang-don uses a strategy not to convene the group, the chairman will be dismissed as chairman and the vice chairman will have the power to convene the group. Two vice speakers are Rep. Yun Young-il and Lee Yong-ho. Among them, Congressman Yoon Young-il is trying to block the integration by joining the People's Party Defense Movement, a group of opposition lawmakers, along with Chairman Lee Sang-don. Rep. Lee Yong-ho, who is on the floor leadership as the chief policymaker, is completely neutral, so the power to convene a group is likely to be transferred. The committee earlier designated Chairman Lee Sang-don to address the convocation of the group on June 16-17, during which it is feared he may not convene the group.The opposition is also likely to have carried out a filibuster in the group to prepare a rule for pressuring Chairman Lee, citing the possibility that the unified bill would be rejected. The refinement of the relevant regulations was reviewed by the party's legal committee.

"President Xi Jinping of China's Central Military Intelligence Agency made a joint effort to integrate into the military intelligence service with the leadership of China's military forces in charge of carrying out "" information umbrellas "" at the armed forces ' headquarters in China on July 2, 2018From the beginning of the New Year, Chinese troops have been busy with moves. President Xi Jinping attended the 2018 General Convention on Military Training at the Central Theater of the Baoding Pavilion on July 3. At the instruction of the city's president, about 4,000 military, naval, air, rocket, and armed police in all regions began field training in perfect order. However, the Strategic Support Force (SSF), a game-changer of the military reform of President Xi Jinping, was not exposed on the China Central Broadcasting System (CC-TV) screen. The Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in Shanxi Province on July 9 is equipped with a very precise observation satellite Gao Jing (Kao- 景) - equipped with a ground-level motion sensing feature - Kaojing-2. The Taiyuan launch center is a military-level organization of the space unit under the China Strategic Support Unit. At 11:24 a.m. on July 9, Changcheong-2 headed to space for the first time at the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in Shanxi Province. It is equipped with a very precise observation satellite, Gao Jing (Ko 景) No.1, that can detect movements as far as 0.5m above the ground. China's Air Force-Chinese Group (CASIC) is planning to launch its Changcheng rocket 35 times this year. It is about twice as many as last year's 18th meeting. The Taiyuan Launch Center is a military-level organization of an SSF (Space Unit). Two years have passed since the SSF, which unifies cyber, intelligence and electronic power, was created in the U.S. and Russian space forces. The reality is still veiled. U.S. military expert Bill Gutz recently told the Hong Kong Asia Times : "" The SSF is a new species that unifies aerospace, intelligence and cyber organizations, but detailed structures and missions are still a mystery. "" Graphic : Kim Young-oak, journalist at yesok@joongang.co.kr and President Xi Jinping, carried out military reforms based on the concept of hwajeon jeong (meaning "" the exhibition "" and peacetime) at the end of 2015. The existing seven shells were replaced by five light bulbs and the strategic nuclear and missile powered 2nd artillery was converted into rockets. SSF was founded with an emphasis on modernization, information services, and coalescence. SSF followed the military doctrine of integrating reconnaissance, attack, and defense. President Xi Jinping announced in a report at the 19th Congress last year that he would "" carry out a military strategy based on the new situation, establish a strong, modern joint command, naval, air, and rocket forces, and establish a strategic support unit. "" SSF is the main force to enable Chinese troops, who are lagging behind the U.S. troops in conventional weapons and nuclear power, to have asymmetric advanced forces to surpass the U.S. military in the mid-century century. The SSF should ensure accurate, efficient, reliable information support and strategic support for the entire armed forces, ' said Ko Oh-jin, a senior commander of the current Strategic Assistance Command. The United States introduced the concept of an information umbrella, which was developed as an information service after September 11, 2001. Main task is to provide information assets to the entire army by integrating satellite, cyber, information and electronic resources. Information capabilities used by the four main forces, the seven largest military districts, the Navy, Navy, Air Force and 2nd artillery were consolidated into SSF and placed directly under the Central Military Commission. Airforce pilots fly on fighter jets on orders from President Xi Jinping at the 2018 Military Training Contest held on July 3.Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army rocket troops rush to Dongfeng missile after President Xi Jinping announced them to take part in the 2018 Military Training Contest held on July 3. Armed police officers at the 2018 Military Training Contest held on July 3 head to the training camp as President Xi Jinping announced. Armed police forces have been transferred to the Central Military Commission this year from the existing rules to direct orders. An Army unit in the 2018 Military Training Commissioners Meeting, which was held on May 3, is at the training camp as President Xi Jinping announced it.On March 3, South Korean naval aircraft belonging to the Royal Marines, who participated in the 2018 Military Training Commemorations Meeting, boarded the ship after President Xi Jinping ordered them to do so.Another reason for the consolidation of information assets is to help President Xi Jinping gain power. Xi also secured military control by taking control of the entire army's networks-without SSF. The key competence of SSF in the construction of Information umbrellas is the aerospace sector. Transferred from the chief of the general affairs department SSF also controls navigation system, the Baidou satellite against Western GPS. Satellite communications and ballistic missile detection are also controlled by the military. "" Star Wars "" capabilities have also been enhanced. The U.S.-China Economic Security Review Board warned in its annual report in 2017 that it is equipped with a missile for satellite strikes, a co-orbit system and a land-based energy (laser) weapon. Taiwan's Central Investigation Department said late last year that the combined operation of satellite communication platforms within the six, six, marine, air, and rocket divisions has been expanding to the global level since 2016. SSF also focused on information consolidation. China has been operating its information independently by the National Security Agency, the Army, and the Public Security Department. The second largest national intelligence agency, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, led the organization's information bureau. When creating the SSF, the IT information collection team of the General Services Division, the military unit of the political ministry, and the general affairs department was transferred. All but the other information workers were transferred to the Central Intelligence Agency and the SSF when the former political ministry liaison department responsible for intelligence services in Korea, North Korea, Taiwan and Japan disbanded, Taiwan and Taiwan's Free Time Agency said. In addition, the technical reconnaissance service, which is responsible for monitoring, decoding, and reading satellite images, was transferred to SSF under the control of the general reference department. In other words, the nation's information service has become more sophisticated. Professor Lin Ying-gwI of the University of Foreign Affairs and Trade said, "" The original names of the existing political ministry's liaison division were counterintelligence, treason, public opinion, and psychological warfare. "" SSF unifies these military intelligence agencies to function as the U.S. Agency for Defense Information (DIA) and the Russian bureau of intelligence (GRU). The development of cyber capacity in SSF is also remarkable. "" SSF utilizes big data and machine learning as the impetus for future development, "" said the think tank, the New America Security Center (CNAS), before the electronic warfare effort of cyber warriors. The agencies under the wing of the Research Center for Research on Advanced Technology are those specializing in cyber warfare. It is also known that hackers have been stealing various personal data through advanced continuous attacks. The United States is becoming alarmed at the rapid development of SSF. `` The SSF gives us the shadow of an inactive demand for defense and attack from the People's Liberation Army, '' said James Pannell, former chief of the U.S. Pacific Command's fleet's intelligence services, adding, `` An advanced radar, an ultra-precision satellite, and a cyber unit.

However, experts point out that a lack of supplies is the main cause of the overheated Seoul apartment market.As the pressure on multiple home owners continues, the demand for a smarter house will continue to stimulate the housing price hikes, said Suh Sang-kwon, a senior researcher at the Real Estate 114.Jeong Byung-mook (honnezo@edaily.co.kr)"

Iranian officials have declared that they do not wish to save more than 30 crew members before the ship sank.China also said the sinking of the oil tanker was unlikely to lead to an environmental disaster.The sunken ship collided with the Hong Kong-controlled freighter CF Crystal on the night of July 6 at 260 kilometers east of Shanghai, China. Rescue work was hampered by the vessel's one-weekend blaze.At the time of the collision, Sanchi was heading to Korea after carrying 136,000 tons of crude oil from Iran.A total of 32 sailors were Iranian, excluding two Bangladeshis. Only three bodies were recovered.Despite rescue and evolution efforts, the ship suddenly caught fire around noon today, the CCTV reported.According to the Chinese transportation ministry, the flames were intense and the smoke rose to an altitude of 800-1000 meters. The ministry released several photographs of the ship, which were wrapped in black smoke and were unable to identify its shape.The ship sank not long after.Mohammadrastad, Iran's rescue spokesman, told Iranian state television shortly before the sinking that "" there is no hope of finding any survivors among the sailors.

""As we tried, it was impossible to control the bodies by catching the ship`s flames, he said. It is because the explosion and gas leakage occurred repeatedly.One of the biggest reasons for the rescue efforts was the hull temperature, which reached as high as 89 degrees Celsius, the company explained.Foreign media, including AFP, however, noted that the rescue team from China has recalled the black box from the tanker on Dec. 13, drawing attention to whether it would help determine the cause of the accident.As the oil tanker was loaded with large quantities of crude oil, the impact on the natural environment is also drawing keen attention. A CCTV reporter got on an airplane and covered the tanker in the sky, saying the leaked oil covered about 10 square kilometers of the nearby sea.A CCTV reporter told social media that the oil spill is "" very serious. ""But Jang Yong, an expert at the Chinese government, said, It is hard to say that it will have a relatively small impact compared to other oil spill cases because it is hard to break oil. Most of them will come into contact with the atmosphere and the sea will not have much impact, the analysis said.The expert also predicted that "" the effect on humans will be minimized because the area is open and away from where people live.

Park Cho-rong, a reporter at Seoul Yonhap News Agency, said, "" Starting Monday, the first train runs free of charge on buses and subways during rush hours. Seoul City announced on July 14 that it will issue an emergency reduction of micro-dust dust in Seoul as ultra-violet dust levels are forecast to be "" bad "" for the second straight day. This measure indicates that the average concentration of ultrafine dust (PM2.5) exceeds 50 ㎍p from midnight to 4 P.M., and the day after that traffic is also expected to be ' bad ', with ' bad ' levels expected to be available. It is the first time that a micro-duster emergency reduction measure has been implemented since the system was adopted on July 1 of last year, and the first time public transportation has been free. The emergency reduction measure was also implemented on July 29 because of high levels of dust, but the free transportation policy was not enforced because it falls on Saturday. Reduction in public transportation fees and a second subtitle for public institution vehicles are in effect on weekdays only. The exemption from public transportation charges applies for starting at the beginning of the day and leaving at 9 a.m. and leaving at 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Bus fares to downtown and village buses from Seoul, subway lines 1-9, and Uisinseol are exempt. Since the city is not involved in the Seoul emergency reduction measures, citizens can only ride the Seoul buses and subways for free. In case of confusion over which buses are free, the Seoul Metropolitan Government has developed a system that charges a user when he or she writes a transportation card on a terminal. Even though public transportation is free, you should take a transportation card or credit check card with you to the terminal. If you tag the cards as usual, you can automatically get charged for any number of transfers between Seoul and Gyeonggi buses. You can get a cancellation fee only for passengers using pre - or post-paid transportation cards. One-time ticket or season ticket holders are excluded from the exemption. Lee Ji-eun (Yonhap News Agency), who is waiting for the bus to leave the office, said, "" I saw a man covering his face on Sejong-daero Street in Seoul yesterday afternoon. Take, for example, A, an office worker who rides a game bus in Paju, Gyeonggi-do, Seoul City, and travels to Jongno from Hapjeong-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul. Normally, A pays 1,250 won for a race bus ride, and then a transfer fee of 200 won for a Seoul bus is added to the price of 1,450 won. If the fare is free on July 15, he will have to pay only 1,250 won for the race bus fare. On the contrary, an office worker who takes a Seoul bus in Jongno and changes his office bus from Hapjeong-dong to Paju Book Park only pays 250 won for the bus. A basic fare for Seoul buses is exempt, and the fare is 50 won for switching to a race bus (the basic fare for race buses is 150 won, 50 won higher than that for Seoul buses) and 200 won per trip. To ease the congestion caused by the rush hour, the Seoul Metropolitan Government will increase the number of bus routes (seven metropolitan buses and 19 downtown buses) that are expected to be higher. The free transportation policy is the concept that the city pays public transportation fees in taxes. The Seoul Metropolitan Government expects that when the number of passengers are exempt from the commute to work, the transportation company will have to pay 5 billion won per day. A 20 percent increase in passengers due to free use policies costs 6 billion won a day. Seoul City expects the micro-dust emergency reduction measures to take effect about seven times a year, in view of the average year.▽ Government / Seoul = United news = Environmental Protection and environment policy officer Kim Jong-ryul announced on July 14 that the dust reduction was carried out from 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. in the annex of the Seoul Metropolitan Government building.

The operation rate of the 12 air pollutant emission facilities such as resource recovery facilities and water recovery centers is cut. In addition, 180 construction sites ordered by public agencies such as Seoul City will be cut down to limit dust generation.

It seems to be confusing on this point.Prime Minister Lee said, I do not have any clear intention of blockading the block chains, although there has been a ministry-specific temperature difference for some time, the government as a whole would not touch them."

"South Korean Sports chairman Lee Ki-heung announced yesterday that she will lead a joint women's ice hockey team at the Pyeongchang Olympics. When Chairman Lee was in the media spotlight and expressed willingness to form a single team, the Korean women ice hockey players slept through long training courses in the Economy class, returning from their U.S. training. From July 26, when we were enjoying the festive mood of the holiday, the athletes who had returned home from a faraway land said, "" I haven't shown much effort, "" and instead expressed frustration over having promoted a unified team. Despite the positive aspect of inter-Korean reconciliation, it is clear that this single team initiative is hasty and overstretched.● A cosmetic entry increase of 23 + α Chairman Lee Ki-heung says he will ask the IOC to expand the roster of athletes to minimize damage. However, expanding the full entry does not increase the number of competitors available to compete. The national women's ice hockey team will field a maximum of 23 athletes, with only 22 allowed to compete in the event. Even though the IOC will increase the total entry level of Tim Korea to around 30, Chairman Lee's wishes do not mean that 22 more entries will be made.In this case, the damage is minimized, but the injury can only increase. You can't get North Korean athletes off the roster by setting up a unified team, and then we can see some of them end up waiting for the North Koreans who are worse off on the Olympics. (I wonder if the Olympic Stadium bench is equipped to seat 22 athletes so I can watch it from my side.) That does not mean that we can add 22 more entries. That's not much different from what we say 15 people would play in soccer. (Ice hockey requires extreme stamina, so athletes must replace it constantly every 50 seconds to 1 minute. More entries are needed to help the athletes to save energy and have a strong influence on their performance.) If the Korean Olympic Committee requests more entries and the IOC accepts them (for political reasons), it is very likely that the other teams will object. And if one of the other teams allows us to enter the game more ... Can we really call our team's game a sport? It is not a sport that competes fairly, but a political show to show the two Koreas a unified team.What was the investment for? Our athletes have made a lot of investment and efforts in recent years to achieve their first ever win at the Olympics, and now they are on the road to success. The Korean women's national team, which had grown to 10-0 and 20-0 in Asia until just a few years ago, is now on par with the international elite. However, when a unified team is formed between the two Koreas, it is inevitable that the team's strength will weaken. Ice hockey is a team sport that has organizational power and teamwork. Our players have been working together for several years to fill the gaps in individual skills and physical strength that are relatively lower than those of the world's best teams.If North Korean athletes join the team with less than a month to go before the event, the organization's ability to boost its competitiveness will inevitably be shattered. Furthermore, North Korean athletes lack individual skills compared to our athletes. (In last year's Gangneung World Championships, we slightly beat North Korea 3-0 and reached the summit by winning.) It is very different from when a single table tennis team or a soccer team of teenagers worked together to create a synergy effect.First of all, people!Our athletes have sacrificed everything by looking only at Pyeongchang. I gave up the dream of becoming a pianist and postponed my dream of becoming a doctor. Without a college team or an unemployed team, I had to work part-time to make a living. (It is virtually impossible for athletes to get a proper job because of competitions or training in battery.The Taeneung Athletes Link, which is used with figure skating players or short-track speed skaters, could not be walked until after 9 p.m. every day, so the athletes could return home after training. What is the significance of a unified team for South and North Korea that ignored their dreams and sweat?The main character is a player tonight! Player!Dear Leader of the Korea Sports Council, For those in the government or IOC, the promotion of the unified Pyeongchang Games team is also a good opportunity to become a historic figure. However, they have many opportunities to become main characters at different times. The North Korean athletes ' participation in the Olympics and joint South-North positions alone will draw global attention, and if we leave the Olympics and promote regular South-North exchanges in sports, we can make peace and reconciliation at any time.Furthermore, the people of the two Koreas do not want a unified team to impose the sacrifice of its athletes. Public polls show overwhelming opposition to a single team, and single-team protests are brewing on the Internet. There is no reason why you shouldn't be applauded.I hope that the athletes who saw the Olympic stage in Pyeongchang will be the main characters.(Photo : Yonhap) Is it a single team for cracks?

Chung explained that he had no right to investigate the case, saying, We found a criminal case that was not subject to investigation. The prosecution decided, after reviewing the case it received from the special counsel, that it would rather question the case and whether it would investigate or not because the case was repaired. Jeong, who told the media that he had not formally planted the embezzlement case with the special counsel, was quoted as saying by the prosecution as telling the media whether it would be inconvenient to know anything unless the special prosecutor told him one by one.

""The presidential office strongly showed its will to implement the reform with the three major powers by Cho personally announcing the reform package. The Senior Civil Affairs Secretary was responsible for the five major assessment bodies (Public Prosecutors, Police, National Intelligence Service, National Tax Service, and Board of Audit and Inspection).According to the reform package briefed the Chun Chu-gwan, the basic policies of the government's reform measures to reform the power agencies were adopted with the intention of thorough checks on Δ and the movement of the people to control the candlelight vigils against corruption.Prosecutors had enormous power to monopolize the prosecution and direct investigation, to command the police investigation, and to act as a brother, but were not pointed out as being properly controlled. Prosecutors have misused their power to maintain political power or their vested rights.The reform measures were announced in a way that would limit the power of investigations, transfer of investigations by high-ranking government officials, and special investigations into direct ones.

""" Let's Go to Gangnam, "" a housing price hike by local big names again, a roaring real estate market in Gangnam, and a boom in Gangnam, Gangwon Province, and a boom in apartment prices at sannae@donga.comIt is a joke among real estate agents in Gangnam area in Seoul these days. Financial people living in Ulsan or Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, say they "" have to move in case of an earthquake or go to Gangnam. "" “‘The lion house in Seoul’, Roh Moo-hyun government, and ‘Lion house in Gangnam’ these days it would have been there by bus and came up again.” is talking about a mixed response. Home prices have risen throughout the country, including throughout the city in the Roh Moo-hyun's administration because they are concentrated at Gangnam in now. In fact, the real estate market in southern Seoul is heating up. K, 48, director of real estate B, whom we met on July 11, said, "" We have so many questions that we haven't been able to properly eat lunch in a month or two, "" adding, "" Too many people wanted to buy apartments in Gangnam. While talking to the reporter, the office phone and the phone calling him rang constantly. He said, I worked without holidays, but I had only two days off at the beginning of the year. But the new two days, the prices rose by 50 million won, said (the rise). A few days ago, a buyer decided to put 50 million won down and make a contract the next day, but a buyer said, "" The seller might change his or her mind overnight, "" and added, "" I have to go with a down payment. "" It is also becoming more popular to collect sales figures. An apartment in Banpo-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul, sold for 2.05 billion won late last December. About ten days have passed before a buyer has appeared. However, no deal was made. It is because the owners collected the sale. At first, we wanted our landlord to sell us the item quickly, but when they said, let's close the deal, the brokerage head of S-Property in Seoul, J-Project quoted us 2.2 billion won. Amid this sentiment, housing prices in Gangnam are showing an upward trend. Until last September, the price of apartments in Daechi-dong, Gangnam-gu traded at 1.69 billion won (2.08 million U.S. dollars) was surpassed by about 2.02 billion won (2.08 million dollars) in December. Currently, the bid is estimated at 2.1 billion won, but the sale has disappeared. The nearby apartment price of Jogok-dong Reksul also rose from 1.4 billion won to 1.6 billion won in December last year. According to Kookmin Bank, the average price per square meter of apartments in Gangnam-gu rose more than 3 percent from 129.8 million won on December 11 last year to 134.1 million won on July 8, exceeding the 13 million won mark for the first time. In a weekly survey conducted by real estate 114, Songpa-gu (1.19 %) and Gangnam-gu (1.03 %) were also raised by more than 1 % in the second week of January. It is the highest since November 10, 2006. As a result, the price of apartments in Seoul jumped 0.57 percent from the previous week. Such a situation was predicted to be somewhat immediately after the inauguration of the incumbent administration. Expectations were also high that the price of apartments in Gangnam would be raised again. Restrictive property regulations at the time Roh Moo-hyun government to boosting the supply is shrinking, apartment prices in Gangnam as an analysis based on the learning experience. My expectation was right. “Recently, a nearby business get together with the representative of the situation in these days and ‘Roh Moo-hyun government in junior year of the season’ agreed that”, a licensed real estate agent, a representative in Gangnam said. The term "" seasonally-2 "" also implies that although the pattern is similar to that of the season, the aggressive behavior is more serious. It has been a long time since apartments in Gangnam were considered ' real estate luxury. ' The educational environment is so good that it is called an "" education special zone "" in a convenient and pleasant life infrastructure. Still, it has been relatively stable in recent years. It is the incumbent administration that stimulated real estate prices in Gangnam. First of all, various measures to stabilize the real estate market, including targeting multiple home owners, have sparked off a nationwide campaign. A growing number of people have gathered in Gangnam apartments to sell several and leave only one. It's a piece of cake. Real estate analyst Park Won-gap at KB Kookmin Bank said, We are moving to purchase cash-building apartments in Gangnam, where even local asset owners have assets. The policy of autonomous high schools (private high schools) and foreign language high schools (foreign language high schools) to be adopted starting from the end of this year also affected. Parents who seek quality education are paying more attention to Gangnam area. The first and second graders policy of Chong-ho, Lim Sung-ho, said, will break the psychological barrier of parents who live outside of Gangnam and send their children to good schools. An expert in education “The government has been going backwards to take the Gangnam '.”, saying, “Gangnam, criticizes the blow to prevent the Lee Myung-bak introduced at the government policy.” high.Criticism. The prolonged low interest rate, the stock market boom, and the thriving virtual currency market also helped to fire up the overheated Gangnam property market. Investors with ` live ammunition ` are flocking to Gangnam real estate, a safe asset. According to the Bank of Korea, the amount of money spent in the market was 2522 trillion won as of the end of November last year, the largest ever. A string of major development benefits, such as the opening of SRT from the office and the promotion of the Global Business Center (GBC), also attracted investors to Gangnam. Kim Hak-ryul, director of the Research Group's real estate research center, said, "" The three districts have more than 1.5 million jobs, including the headquarters of big businesses, and have no good facilities for cutting down on apartments, good schools, and transportation. "" As demand grows, the supply and demand index of housing sales in Gangnam 4 (Gangnam, Seocho, Songpa, and Gangdong districts) increases sharply. According to the Korea Institute of Audit and Inspection, the supply and demand index for the four districts of Gangnam stood at 116.7 last December, the highest since July 2012, when figures were first compiled. It is 9.3 points higher than the previous month. This year, the number of respondents was also on the rise to 121.1 (time of day 1·examination) and 122.5 (day 8). This number means that the larger than 100 the demand is greater than the supply. However, the supply is far from sufficient. According to Property 114, the total number of apartments in Gangnam, Seocho and Songpa districts last year was only about 4300, down 30 percent from the previous year (6,620). It was the lowest volume in five years. The volume of new homes will grow to 15,000 this year, but it will shrink to 4,800 by 2019. Experts agree that expanding supply and dispersion of demand should be implemented simultaneously to stabilize the Gangnam real estate market. Kim Deok-rye, director of the Housing Research Institute at the Korea Housing Industry Institute, said, We need to improve land use regulations that were created in the early 2000s so that new apartments could be supplied in Seoul. We need to adjust the pace so that the simultaneous reconstruction of homes in Gangnam is as well as encouraging a rise in house prices, said Jin Mi-yoon, an economist at the Korea Housing Institute. Shim Kyo-eon, a real estate professor at Konkuk University, advised, "" Loosen the greenbelt belts in Seongnam, Hanam, Kyonggi Province, and Gwacheon to use them as land sites.
