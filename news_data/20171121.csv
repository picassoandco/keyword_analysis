"▽ Secure November 21, 1997 = Due to the negative effects of the IMF's rapid economic growth, the current growth of more than 17,000 businesses in 1997 alone, the current growth rate of more than USD 170 billion, and the need to collect and recover the domestic economy by collecting the current account balance of 5.5 %. At 10 p.m. on November 21, 1997, Im Chang-yeol, deputy prime minister and Minister of Finance and Economy, held an emergency press conference at the Gwanghwamun Government Complex and officially requested a "" rescue package "" from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This happened five days after former IMF chief Michelle Kandsh secretly visited Korea. The request for a bailout package was inevitable. Since the beginning of this year, the amount of foreign exchange reserves has decreased rapidly due to the continuous corporate bankruptcies of conglomerates and the Asian currency crisis. As if to mock the comments made by top Korean government officials who used to have a problem with the Korean economy, foreigners who invested in the country scrambled to withdraw investment funds and withdrew. The dollar is lean. Just before the IMF bailout, Korea had only $ 6 billion in available foreign exchange reserves. Foreign exchange holdings have since declined to a minimum of $ 3.9 billion. There was no way to hold out. About 10 days after the rescue package was confirmed, South Korea signed the IMF's Financial Aid Agreement on December 3. It was the start of a cold, hungry IMF regime. The IMF, the epitome of an economic crisis, came to us just 20 years ago and wiped out the nation in a tsunami. It was a time when the Korean economy, which had been on a roll for so long and unaware of the crisis, faced a huge ordeal. Members of the Korea Financial Supervisory Service are blocking Shinhan's entry to the main office of Donghwa Bank in northern Seoul yesterday. Kim Dae-jung administration's first ‘system of imf’ initial crisis as the Minister of Finance and Economy Lee Kyu-seong, who headed the former minister 『 Korean Miracle 4 : a peak of the financial crisis.Beyond 』 of the financial crisis in a book, took four on the grounds. ^ Structural vulnerability of the Korean economy and businesses ^ Greater external opening when the Korean economy is unprepared ^ It is the instability of the international financial system as represented by excessive short-term borrowings from abroad ^ the Asian currency crisis. At that time, the Korean economy and businesses were about to explode due to accumulated abuses of high growth and 30 years of growth. Businesses should use other people's money to make an all-out effort to grow their businesses ' businesses ' businesses. Excessive and redundant investment was common, and the financial structure was vulnerable. In 1997, the average debt ratio of manufacturers was 396 percent. The moral hazard, such as the unreasonableness of the cozy ties between politicians and businessmen, and an invincible defeat at banks, Lee said. The situation has exposed the vulnerabilities of the economy while being alienated from global standards, said a spokesman for Korea`s leading economic organizations. In the IMF regime, businesses and banks fell one after another, and workers were thrown into the streets. In 1997, the number of companies crashed, including eight of the top 30 companies. Economic growth has dropped from 7 to 8 percent a year to 5.5 percent in 1998. Five banks, including Donghwa Bank, were forced to resign and Korea First Bank and Korea Exchange Bank were sold to foreign funds. Unemployment increased, and the young man could not get a job, so he had to quit. Unemployment soared to 8.8 percent in February 1998 and that of youth was 14.5 percent. However, the foreign exchange crisis is also a victory that has overcome the crisis with the unity of the public and private sector. Direct economic policy coordination meeting presided over by the president stunned the world will take the bullet, and of the crisis, people respond with ‘by gathering gold movement’. Economic indicators and figures have recovered in the near future. Korea paid off all of its debts in August 2001 and shut down the IMF system. It was a faster-than-expected early graduation. A campaign to overcome the foreign exchange crisis is underway at the head of the Korea Housing Bank and at various branches nationwide.The campaign, which will continue until July 31, has been popular since July 5. The biggest gift of the process was the restructuring of the Korean economy and the improvement of its constitution. Although it was by other means, a series of reforms made during the financial crisis have completely reset the Korean economy. Thanks to that, the Korean economy has gained more nutrients to help it take it to the next level. That is why he said, "" The foreign exchange crisis is a blessing in disguise. "" The imminent foreign exchange reserves surged to $ 384.4 billion as of October. Korea has the world's ninth largest foreign reserves. At least the possibility of a foreign exchange crisis has been reduced due to a lack of foreign reserves. The Korean economy is receiving a high level of international evaluation as financial soundness is added to this. In 1997, Standard & Poor`s, Fitch, and Moody`s rated Korea at B+B, B-Bar and Ba1, respectively. But the current credit rating in Korea has significantly improved with AA (11 steps higher), AA - (12 steps higher) and Aa2 (8 steps higher), respectively. All three places were rated higher than Japan. Despite the external crisis, the ongoing restructuring of the Korean economy after the IMF regime's graduation is putting a huge burden on the Korean economy. Former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Economy Jin Nyum, who was head of the economic organization at the time, said, "" Changing the system or the constitution was not meaningful when it was not done once or continuously, "" adding, "" It was not desirable that the law was adjusted to the goals of the restructuring system after the foreign exchange crisis. "" The result of failing to restructure the Korean economy on a regular basis is the Korean economy 20 years later. Korea`s economic growth is still below the global average, although the strong global economy and therefore strong exports are expected to help the nation achieve 3 percent this year. Unemployment among young people has soared to the highest level since the foreign exchange crisis, and domestic demand is still on the verge of a consumer cliff. With the rate hike on the horizon to resume, household debt of 1400 trillion won is a huge burden. Moon Jae-in, the government fair income and growth, innovation that keeping the economy by the growth target achievement, but plans are uncertain. Rather, some worry that the policies of raising the minimum wage could undermine the mid-term growth engine. How can we prevent a new economic crisis? One of the first things to be considered is to fill up the national treasury. Former Financial Services Commission Chairman Shin Je-yoon recently told a symposium, "" We have tried to maintain the current account surplus as much as possible at any time and the total amount of foreign debt should be managed as we can, especially in any kind. "" Experts advise that businesses and people should improve their competitiveness on the basis of the 20 years of the foreign exchange crisis and thus prevent a new economic crisis. Choi Jong-chan, former minister of construction and transportation, said, All economic problems have finally exceeded the period when the law needs to be enforced, so it should create a favorable environment for businesses to do so through deregulation. There is also a need for labor reform. Korea ranked 73rd among 139 countries in labor market efficiency and 116th in redundancy costs, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF) ` s national competitiveness assessment announced in September. The WEF pointed out that the low efficiency of the labor market is a chronic factor that hinders the rise of the nation`s competitiveness (Korea). Usually, wages, minimum wage and shorter working hours are all clustered together, said Kwon Soon-won, a professor of business administration at Sookmyung University in Seoul, in an attempt to reform the labor market in a comprehensive manner.

Kim, who has received a public protest over a drunken brawl in January and was sentenced by the court to suspend his execution, may face additional punishment if the incident is prolonged into law. Kim attended a social gathering of about 10 new lawyers at a large law firm last September, and was so drunk she could hardly keep herself steady that she spoke to lawyers and used violence. Kim asked lawyers with older people, "" What are you doing with your father? "" and wrote, "" Call me a shareholder, "" and "" Keep your back straight. "" Some lawyers left early on in their acts, and the rest of them took Kim, who was unable to keep his body in balance, out of the room and were reportedly slapped with a blow to the face or caught in the head.Hanwha 3 South and South Korean Kim Dong-sun from Prisons ' Prisons ' Prisonercies ' Defenders ' Association Kim Dong-seon was released from Seoul Detention-Provident Center on March 8. This is not the first time that Kim has acted out of step. He was drunk and assaulted his employees at a bar in Cheongdam-dong, southern Seoul, saying, "" I don't do it right, "" and then waved whiskey bottles at the manager who stopped him. Kim also tore the seat of a patrol car and stirred up a riot act while being taken to police. Kim, who was arrested at the time, was released in February after receiving a suspended sentence of two years in jail after appealing for leniency. On January 5, he and his son Kim Dong-sun, who was drunk and hit an employee at a bar in Cheongdam-dong, southern Seoul, were seen pissing off Hanwha Group Chairman Kim Seung-youn and other employees at a Yonhap news agency in Seoul. Three hotel employees were injured in the process. Kim was booked at the time, but was put on probation after agreeing with the victims. The deviation of Hanwha family members was not limited to Kim. Kim Dong-won, 32, the second son of chairman Kim Seung-youn, was also prosecuted for smoking marijuana in February 2014 and was given a stay of execution in the court.The second son of Hanwha Group Chairman Kim Seung-youn, Kim Dong-won, was indicted four times by a U.S. soldier on charges of smoking four times when he was handed over by an acquaintance to some of the marijuana that he smuggled into Korea from 2010 to 2012. Kim Dong-won was even caught running away without any relief measures after causing a traffic accident in 2011 and received a summary order of 7 million won in fines. The much more popular case of Kim Seung-youn's so-called "" revenge attack "" was triggered by his second son, Kim Dong-won. At a karaoke booth in Cheongdam-dong, Seoul, Kim visited his second son, who was then 22 years old, to be injured in a dispute with a group of S-club employees, and engaged in mobilization of his bodyguards and a house security service. He then drove the four S Club employees who had fought with his son to Mt. Cheonggye and beat them with steel pipes. The case was criticized as a ' aid package of conglomerates.

"Lee Tae-hee (left), head of the Korean Council for Religion and Income Taxation, hosted by National Assembly Member General Lee Eon-ju, attended an emergency meeting at the National Assembly Hall in Yeouido on July 14. yesphoto@newsis.com (November 14, 1717.14) is a mother of the "" mother belief "" that Kim Hyun-soo (42, alias) is in charge of public relations at one small Korean office. Both of his parents, who are Christians, showed a good attitude toward the religious tax controversy on July 14, saying, Protestant Church can not go against the people. The church's 250 members, who run around the country, have already voluntarily paid income tax since four years ago. The tax authorities have not yet had any major conflicts over what to impose, he added. Most of our churches were so small they had little internal resistance when they decided to pay their income tax, Kim said with a sheepish smile. Regarding the reason why Protestants have opposed taxing, he asked, "" Isn't it because the ministers at the end of the church earn more than other religions? "" As church is relatively affluent and ministers are raising their own homes, they are paying more in regular income and pay more taxes than other religions. Shin Doo-young (49, alias), who has worked as a journalist for the Buddhist newspaper for more than 20 years, explained in a similar vein the reason why Buddhist followers accepted the tax on religious people. Monks have no dependents except for those allowed to marry Taego or Jingakjong, and since they ate and slept in temples, they were found to have little to live on, such as food and housing costs. Shin explains that most monks are exempt from taxation, explaining that they are low-income people by the standards of the world. "" I don't see why we should object to the idea of paying income tax when the income is low, "" he said, referring to specific cases in the process of implementation as shown in the Kim Young-ran law. He added, I can kill two birds with one stone by paying taxes and getting medical insurance. The controversial and flawed religious income tax is expected to go into effect starting next January. The conservative Protestants, who had called for a delay in taxation, decided to accept the bill on condition that it would be properly compensated. Most of the major religious groups, including Buddhism and Catholicism, had accepted the tax early to the principle that "" even religious people can not be exempt from the obligation to pay taxes, "" but Protestants opposed the government's policy to impose income tax according to the law next year. Protestants have expressed their position not to object to the religious income tax on principle. However, it has been unable to narrow differences with the tax authorities on the scope of income subject to taxation. The government and Protestants have been at odds over which items religious groups can tax regularly on their own income. The detailed tax base proposal that the government presented to Protestants divides the spending of religious people into 40 categories. Among them are _ _ _ household expenses _ _ _ bonus _ expenses for the ministry's _ missionary funds _ tuition _ research funds _ educational funds _ and education expenses _ and educational expenses _ and educational expenses _ among others. At the center of the controversy is the scope of tax-free income that avoids paying taxes among 40 different categories. Until now, whether to impose taxes or not has become a hot potato, as they are considered income. Religious people usually spent money on pastoral work were not classified as religious accounting, but as religious group accounting, and were exempt from paying income tax. The problem is that its boundaries or standards are not clear. The most popular item is the "" pastoral work expenses, "" the cost of selling and selling books for the minister in charge. The government will not have to submit a document that says the fund was used for pastoral work before it can be exempt from imposing income taxes, according to the government. However, religious officials say many cases are difficult to verify. The ministry's activity costs are finally church funds that move through the hands of a parson, not personal income, and that means that it is inappropriate to impose an income tax. Experts say the controversy over the scope of the tax could arise at any time during the enforcement process, even at other ends of the agreement to impose income tax. How Buddhist followers can explain the nature of the ` galmabI `, which they listen to and present after receiving Buddhist scriptures under the invitation of a powerful monk, and how Buddhist monks at the temple can give out gifts to others as their personal money. That is why Protestants pointed out that they had to delay the idea of a reduction in the implementation of income tax, including taking time to make ends meet. The protestant government held a closed-door meeting in Yeouido on July 14 to delay its implementation for another two years. However, it is analyzed that the deep-rooted distrust of the progressive government also played a part in the Protestant group's refusal to impose taxes on religious people. ‘The candle over’ backed by the successful conservative Protestant under the guise of tax investigations at the Moon Jae-in government in the power and hand whether they would not see. The current government can secure some resources needed for major projects such as raising minimum wage through religion-led taxation and increasing the number of government employees, and make it possible to make the conservative Protestants ' camp feel guilty about killing themselves. The re-invention of church inheritance and slush funds by some major churches, including the prestigious church, is also likely to fuel the unrest among Protestants. It has been reported that some Protestant churches recently asked the National Tax Service to clarify whether to exclude tax investigations. The NTS officials called on religious groups to ask for tax data or investigate them to threaten the principle of separation of religions. However, some analyze that behind the voices, one can see a sense of crisis that one can be swept away by the strong flow of cleaning up enemy abuses. Some Protestants said they would establish a two-way communication channel between the government and Protestants, and ask for a first investigation when word of tax was received. Behind the Protestant groups ` strong refusal to pay taxes is the Church's original sin. Protestants have set their sights on a progressive government. Roh Moo-hyun government are pushing ahead with reform bills some Protestant ministry at the time of an amendment bill they shaved their heads struggle to the opposition, the campaign. In addition, Lee Myung-bak to win the election the president the last president Ambition Statement ` which elders in 2007 to spread the blatant collective action, and some large congregation since last year.Even the finger at rallies of being behind the national flag. Critics say the Protestant church, which erupted in protest against corrupt Catholics 500 years ago, has become a part of a vested interest in Korea. As the church and the university have rapidly increased in taxes and grown into a business organization, conservative colors have deepened. Reverend Kim Sam-hwan of Myungsung Church, who is in trouble for the succession controversy, also told a Sunday sermon after the accident in March 2014, I don`t think someone was to blame but to make us cry. Park Geun-hye was then president to virtually a remark interpreted as the indulgence. Protestants earlier promoted the slogan of ` patriotism Christianity ` and supported anti-North Korean protests in the early 2000s. They blame the moral decay of American society and are following in the footsteps of Protestant groups, which have led to a huge flow of conservatism. The controversy over religious income tax, in particular, has fueled public debate on Protestant reform, coupled with the issue of the inheritance of some major churches. Of course, some Protestant groups have accepted the imposition of income tax earlier. The largest Protestant church in the world, the Church of Full Gospel, pays income tax. In addition, Catholics and the Anglican Church of Korea are paying taxes at the church level, and some Baptist churches are paying income tax. A ministry official said that Tongil Bridge has also paid income tax since 2012. Meanwhile, the ministry estimates real tax payments among the total 230,000 people, or 20 percent, to 50,000. Tax revenues are estimated to be only 10 billion won more. yunghp@newsis.com>"
"Taxi drivers opposed to car pool sharing services (Yonhap news) : "" Taxi drivers belonging to four taxi groups are calling for survival in a conference to eliminate illegal car pool operations next to Seoul City Hall on July 21. At the rally, taxi drivers demanded the government and the local government to come up with countermeasures, claiming that the sale of pass-sharing services using the passenger-sharing service apps is threatening the taxi sector`s survival. Lee Tae-soo, reporter of Yonhap News Agency, hkmpooh@yna.co.kr( About 400 of the four taxi related businesses, including the Seoul Private Taxi Transport Association, Seoul Taxi Transport Association, Seoul Regional Headquarters of the National Taxi Workers ' Union, and the Seoul Federation of National Housing Workers ' Unions, held an illegal taxi drivers ' meeting in front of the Seoul Metropolitan Government's taxi station on July 21. Taxi industry watchers say that less than a year after the illegal dodgers took to the nation, the influence of the influence of the influence of Woober and the influence of similar applications such as Fullers and Ubershare last year magnified the carporation clause of the car pool. Participants answered, "" These apps set a wide range of pay-to-hour clock hours, hired ordinary drivers who own their cars, and arranged for transportation to an unspecified majority of citizens, "" adding, "" Driver base was charged by more than 300,000 won per month. "" The ministry also informed the three leading pool app companies to stop calling them on July 6, saying, "" The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Technology (MOCT) actually does not want us to use the system because it contravenes the related laws.

At the rally, taxi drivers demanded the government and the local government to come up with countermeasures, claiming that the sale of pass-sharing services using the passenger-sharing service apps is threatening the taxi sector`s survival. The city of hkmpooh@yna.co.kr reported to Article 81 of the Passenger Automobile Transport Business Act that it had prohibited the car pool service from actually being used 24 hours, 365 days a year, as it is strongly commercial. As the car pool system was adopted in 1995 due to the rapid increase in the number of cars during the 1986 Seoul Asian Games and the 1988 Seoul Olympics, the transport service system was designed to provide a 24 hour transportation service based on the logic. As the taxi industry strongly opposes the car-pooling app services, the Seoul Metropolitan Government's planned pan-social forum on dealing with the issue was temporarily postponed. The Seoul Metropolitan Government concluded on the same day that "" the taxi industry is strongly opposed and some organizations requested that they should not attend as debaters. "" "" It is a discussion that was held only by a few groups. "" Meanwhile, the controversy over the car-pooling service is due to a lack of legislation under the Passenger Automobile Transport Business Act, which requires government action, including the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. We will continue to ask the ministry to revise the law and establish guidelines to resolve the fundamental dispute, it added. tsl@yna.co.kr"
"The big influence on marriage is not today, but income, assets and a full-time job are now deciding whether or not they can get married. / A 36-year-old man who works office at a mid-sized business firm based in Chosun Ilbo, Gyeonggi Province, was surprised to see his junior high school reunion in a few years. This is because married friends and unmarried friends are clearly divided.

However, those who did not have girlfriends or would not marry at all were working part-time workers, small businesses, or production jobs. Married friends had childcare or reteak as the talk of the town, while the unmarried had little different to talk about as they did during their early years of life. If marriage is a privilege now, I think it has become a privilege, A said bitterly.Income is the determining factor in Korean men and women in their 30s to marry. The possibility of getting married also differed depending on whether they were full-time or non-regular workers. This means that only the economically powerful people got married.Chosun Biz used the most recent Korean labor panel data compiled by the Korea Labor Institute (18th panel) to analyze income, work patterns, and the size of the workplace at work, education, and socio-economic couples. The labour panel covers 5000 households nationwide and aggregates data on working conditions and income, etc., of 10,0412 persons (based on the 18th survey). The jobs can be roughly identified according to the National Statistical Office's standard 3-digit job category. It also includes responses to the class of respondents who are aware of them. The strong point is that not only the number of samples can be obtained, but also various materials such as human capital, income, jobs, and class recognition such as academic background can be obtained.The analysis targets were 1,281 males and females in their 30s, respectively, and 1,243 and 1,263 respectively. They considered marriage to have been "" fulfillment "" if they had ever married. Although men and women are of different age to marry, the academic circle generally sees around 41 as the end of the marriage process and people in their 20s do not usually marry. According to the National Statistical Office, the average man married for the first time in 2016 was 32.8 years old, while a woman was 30.1 years old. Factors influencing marriage were academic background, income, full-time status, whether they work for large companies, class members (their standards of recognition, stage 6), and age. A linear model of regression, based on which, in addition, a logistic regression commonly used to estimate a particular event occurrence is used.Academic background does not affect the probability of getting married ... The key factor in the marriage performance of men in their 30s was income. Without age consideration, the odds of a change in the marriage rate per million won in monthly income reached 12.4 percent. Even at the same age, the odds of getting married to a million won per month were 9.6 percent. Regular jobs also affected males in their 30s to fulfill their marriage. Men with full-time jobs were 17.7 to 18.5 % more likely to get married than non-working males. Academic background, status of large companies, and social class do not affect students, the report said.The factors that affect the performance of marriage among men in their thirties are working conditions and income, and are economic factors. For example, one person is about 35 years old, but the odds of getting married were 83.9 percent and 46.3 percent, respectively, when it comes to full-time work that makes 4 million won per month and two million won per month for others.The case was different for women. The most relevant item to marital status was socio-economic status. Labor panels try to divide the socio-economic status of those surveyed into six levels, from "" imagination "" to "" ha ha "". If stage I among the total six steps went down, the probability of marriage fell by 7.5 % to 8.4 %.This is because many women quit their jobs or experience separation from their jobs after a few years of marriage. When analyzing the probability of marriage using the same method for women aged 25 to 34, it was found that although the probability of marriage does not necessarily depend on income, there is a positive correlation. The lower the social class, the lower the probability of getting married were common in women aged 25 to 34.The results of the analyses using logistic regression were not different either. For men in their 30s, income was significantly affected, and whether they earned full-time jobs was crucial. Women in their thirties were related to a social class and a large business group. The result for women in the 25-34 class was income and whether or not they hold a large company affects marriage.The result of which the probability of marriage is 7.3 times higher than that of the household at the May 2017 Financial Panel Academic Conference is published by the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training of Youth and Youth University Ph.DAccording to the study, the most important influence on the possibility of a man under the age of 39 getting married was the type of work he did and whether he owned his own home. Men who are full-time were 8.6 times more likely to get married than men who are non-regular. If the number of non-regular men were reversed, only 11.8 percent of male workers in Seoul were likely to get married. The next variable influencing the wedding probability was whether or not the person owned it. Self-owned men had a 7.3 times higher chance of marriage than the non-guided men. Employment was the next highest level of spending after the type of employment and self-holding, but with an increase in spending by 10 percent, the chances of getting married increased by 9.9 percent. Academic background, residential area, and the assets and academic background of parents were found to have little influence.In the case of women, whether they work full-time or non-regular workers was the most important factor in their chances of getting married. Its influence was relatively small compared to that of men. Women who were permanently employed were 2.8 times more likely to get married than women who were not employed at regular jobs. The odds of getting married by women with self-independent were 2.3 times that of women with unconservated mothers.However, if you analyze only on the basis of the working class, it is very similar to the effect of whether men and women work full-time. For those working exclusively, full-time men were 4.6 times more likely to marry than non-regular men. Women on full-time jobs were 4.9 times more likely to be non-regular workers.[Cho KwI-dong, reporter of JogwI-dong news conference, cao@chosunbiz.com]chosunbiz.com"
"[Donga Ilbo] Local Government Office Building Code of Reinforcing Bar Space.....Daeseong Apartment, Pohang City, Seoul Small and Unrepairable & Unrepairable, At least 20 years apart from the wall wall wall wall wall apartment building in Pohang As the quake hit one after another, some residents took out their remaining belongings. The apartments are also badly damaged and need to be demolished. Pohang : Park Kyung-mo, a reporter at Daeseong Apartment, diagnosed the area as inevitable to be demolished : North Gyeongsang Province and Pohang City. Daeseong Apt. is a five-story apartment that was built in 1987. It is just before the mandatory anti-seismic design application (1988). Some of the apartments were even built two years ago. North Gyeongsang Province officials said yesterday, Experts say the reason why the new building was included in the list of the demolition targets is due to possible faulty construction, rather than design and construction.○ All of the apartments to be demolished are located in four in Jangseong-dong, Buk-gu, Pohang, and one in Deoksu-dong and Yangdeok-dong. All of them had a pilotis structure that allowed them to remove walls and support buildings with only pillars. The year of construction is one in 2011, one in 2012, one in 2014, and one in 2015, as well as two in 2007. A total of 77 households are currently occupied. After checking all of the apartments on July 20, the main pillars were left with a large fracture, leaving only the frame or with a portion of the ceiling collapsed. Five of the 11 pillars of the five-story building were broken. In contrast, some parts of the building's 22 pillars were damaged. The number of damaged columns was small but due to the inspection, the damage to the inside was highly likely to cause a collapse and was classified as a target of demolition. Experts are weighing the possible drawbacks. One studio in Jangseong-dong is a four-story building that was built in 2011. Three of the eight pillars supporting the building collapsed during the earthquake. The steel bars inside the pillars seemed dangerous at first sight. About 20 temporary steel supports, which are about 30cm thick, are keeping the building from collapsing. The studio owner said, The design confirmed a space of 15cm between rebars but the construction was made at 30cm. Without support, the building would have collapsed due to aftershocks. Another studio apartment in Jangseong-dong is in a similar situation. Three of the 11 pillars have cracks the size of an adult thumb. The rest of the pillars were more than one meter long and covered with gold. One of the three-story apartments in Deoksu-dong is also in a state where one pillar is severely damaged and 160cm fractured. Despite last year`s Gyeongju earthquake, the sense of security is almost zero. Houses in the Filoty architecture must be supplemented with the participation of architectural structural engineers who are structural safety experts from the design stage.○ As residents leave their homes on July 20, a single studio building in Pohang City, North Gyeongsang Province, suffered severe damage, and around 10 iron supports support the building. The building was also tentatively named for demolition. Pohang : As the Kootg Donga.com, a reporter for Gupyogyo High School, experienced a series of powerful aftershocks of more than 3.0 days, residents of Daeseong Apartment House packed their belongings and left their belongings in the morning. The hope of "" getting well "" was destroyed by strong aftershocks from last night. Lee (61) said, It was quiet, but also an aftershock hit. Now I have to move to another place. Among the total 260 households, three apartments (170) were severely damaged. In reality, it is hard to rebuild part of the building, so it is considered necessary to remove it altogether. However, it is expected that it will take some time to demolish the building. Even if local governments ask the government to remove the materials, the joint inspection team should finish its investigation. It can take at least a few weeks or months at most. It is expected to take at least two or three years to rebuild. North Gyeongsang Province is also set up for the actual removal, although it is still in the stage of making proposals, officials said. We are reviewing possible problems such as the residents ` consent, selection of construction contractors, and a controversy over equity with nearby buildings, the official said.Pohang = Jang Young-hoon, Hwang Sung-ho, and Koo special bridge reporter Facebook."
"▽ Industrial Association, Senior Group and Growth Rate = As the growth rate of the elderly at 51 places such as Gokseong and Boeun is twice higher than that of the past, it is virtually impossible to create such places as Kimje, Jangeun, and Naju, which are under the same conditions of local governments. Fifty-five percent of the population is in their thirties or under. More than 20 percent of births in North Gyeongsang Province are born here in Gumi. The population is also steadily growing. The population of Gumi, which decreased after peaking in March 2015 (426,633), began to recover this year and set a new record high in November (426,464). It is unusual for most municipalities, where people are concerned about population decline. Because they have jobs and money flows. Gumi has a national industrial complex with a size of 226,800 ㎡. It is the largest mountain range in the country. Samsung Electronics and LG Display are home to 2,611 businesses and 96,000 people are working here. Exports have soared this year, reviving the local economy, and the population is also growing. ▽ Graphic : journalist Park Chun-hwan park.choonhwan@joongang.co.kr As an old man complained, It is hard to see young people, it is very clear what the scene of low fertility and aging looks like. Uiseong's population decreased from around 180,000 in the late 1970s to about 50,000 this year. Among them, the elderly population age 65 or older exceeds 35 percent. The baby's cry is faint. She was selected to support the maternity center of the Ministry of Health and Welfare in 2015, so she could receive treatment for an outpatient clinic in a hospital, but before that time, she had not had gynecologists for 18 years. There is still no delivery facility. Eventually, you have to go to another area to have a baby. Uiseong is the most vulnerable among local governments nationwide, according to the Korea Employment Information Service. The decimation risk index is the proportion of the female population aged 20 to 39 years old compared to the elderly population. If the index is lower than 1.0 to 1.5, then it is normal, and if it is less than 0.5 to 1.0, it is decimation. If less than 0.5, it is reported that the area of risk of disappearance is at risk of extinction, especially if it is less than 0.2. Uiseong-gun, however, is only 0.158. Without adequate industrial facilities, it is difficult to expect a new influx of people. The rapid aging of the economy is the enemy. From an spending standpoint, it is inevitable that social security costs will grow. This in turn causes decreased population and a lack of labor. Another burden is the decline in worker productivity due to the average age increase. If the country is hit by aging and low growth, the future of the local economy will be bleak. A quarter of local governments across the country are suffering from double whammy of low-growth and aging. The Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade analyzed the growth characteristics of 203 districts nationwide (excluding 25 districts and Sejong City). The research team categorized the cities and counties into the super-growth, super-aged, high-aged, high-developed and low-growth zones, and the Presidential decree on low growth was utilized by GRDP (One Person) growth rate and elderly population between 2011 and 2013. Worst of all are the low-growth and elderly areas. Fifty-one city districts were included, with the elderly accounting for 11.8 percent of total population, and the average growth rate of GRDP per capita in the nation being lower than the national average of 3.7 percent. Most of them are rural areas, but some big cities including Geumjeong-gu in Busan and Jung-gu in Incheon are included. Furthermore, the elderly were more than doubled and their growth rates were negative in Jeonnam, Chungbuk, Boeun and Hadong, Gyeongnam provinces. It is a signal that the local economy has lost its growth momentum. There were 34 areas that had growth potential and were less burdened by aging. Most of them had large-scale industrial facilities such as Hwaseong, Osan, and Jung-gu in Gyeonggi-do, and had a large influx of young people. Areas that serve as hub cities in the region, such as Cheongju, North Chungcheong, and Jeonju, were also classified as safer areas. Not all elderly people suffer from low-growth. Although the proportion of the over- goryeong population has exceeded 20 percent to enter the super-aged society, 35 regions saw their per capita GRDP increase rate rise by more than 1.5 times the national average. They are Gimje in North Jeolla Province, Naju in South Jeolla Province, and Hoengseong in Gangwon Province. The per capita GRDP increased 7.5 percent in these regions, higher than the non-deduction areas in the Greater Seoul area or metropolitan area, which have excellent industrial infrastructure. When these 35 areas are divided into categories, they can be distinguished as ‘ Manufacturing based agro-fishery type (A) ’, ‘ Service - and farmer-manufacturing growth ’ (B), and ‘ Agriculture and Fisheries Specialised type (C). ’ A shows a mixture of manufacturing and primary industry (agriculture) due to its proximity to the metropolitan area. Heo Moon-gu, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute of Industrial Economics and Trade, said, "" In these regions, employment stability is confirmed as a strong characteristic of manufacturing industries ; and R&D investment is relatively robust, as research and development institutes and universities located in metropolitan areas are close to it. "" In Yugok-ri, Geunbuk-myeon, Cheorwon-gun, Gangwon-do, Korea, Korea, Korea, there are deserted, weedy lungs that are dense with weeds.(Central Photo) B has a larger proportion of young and female growth than other high growth regions. Another characteristic is that it has its own business district that does not depend on metropolitan areas. However, due to the high proportion of the service sector, the company lacks job security. Seven places are included in the list : Hongseong in Chungnam, Jeongeup in Jeollabuk-do. C is the place where the 6th industry has no basis for manufacturing, but has grown the value added in agricultural and fisheries or combined secondary (manufacturing) and tertiary (service) industries. 21 places were included, including Kyeongnam-do, Hapcheon, and Hampyeong-dong. This means that some regions have found their way out of the rapidly aging society. Huh said, "" Non-suspective local governments have little strategy to respond to the highest rate of aging. "" He said, "" They should plan for improvement in the next 10 to 20 years to prepare basic plans for improvement. "" He also said, It is urgent to boost the value of agricultural value-added by nurturing the food manufacturing industry, adding, "" We need to reduce the rapid aging of the farming and employment by inflaming the population of your village. "" Sixteen out of 100 people received less than 850,000 won per month. Workers at small and mid-sized companies earned less than half of their income during the month. According to the National Statistical Office's report on Tuesday, the average wage last year was 2.81 million won per month. When they were set up, median income, which stands for the income of the person in the middle, stood at 2.29 million won, while the difference between median income and average income was 720,000 won. The OECD's ' middle class ' income was less than 50 % and less than 150 % of the median income was 48.9 % of the total. More than 31.0 percent of median income and 20.1 percent of median income were found to be below 50 percent.By income range, the largest proportion of workers in the ‘ over 1.5 million won to less than 2.5 million won ’ section was 25.6 %. Another 16.4 percent of workers who earn less than 850,000 won per month. If the minimum wage is calculated as "" a minimum wage of 6,460 won per hour in 2017, "" the salary of 1,352,240 won per month (based on 202-hour days per month) will be adjusted. In other words, 16 out of 100 people received less than the minimum wage. On average, 58.5 percent of jobs were allocated under 2.5 million won per month, which is relatively low-wage. The average income per age group was in the following order : 40 (3.34 million won), 50 (3.06 million won), 30 (3.06 million won), 60 year olds (1.86 million won) and 29 years old (1.82 million won). This relates to the higher the average income of the longer the length of service. The average monthly income of those who have worked for more than 20 years stood at 64.7 million won, but less than 1.16 million won per year. The wage gap remained wide depending on gender and the size of the company. Men earned 3.87 million won per year, higher than women (2.09 million won). The wage gap is 1.56 times. The gap between men's and women's incomes was greatest at 1.85 million won for people in their 50s. Among for-profit companies, the average income of employees at large companies was 47.4 million won, or 2.5 million won more than that of workers at small businesses. The wage gap (2.11 times) is more than double. More workers earned an average of 4 million won for ' more than 300 ' employees at large companies. By industry, the average monthly income of employees in the financial and insurance industries was highest at 59.6 million won. The self-employed "" accommodation and restaurant business "" was the lowest among the 19 industries, with 3.37 million won. hjpyun@newsis.com>"
"A government official said Monday that North Korean soldiers who defected via the Joint Security Area in the truce village of Panmunjeom yesterday morning regained consciousness over what he called a promise to recover. The North Korean soldier opened his eyes this morning, a South Korean government source said, When I talk to the doctors, they will be blinking to respond. `` He hasn't told us yet, and he doesn't seem to know where he is or what he is doing, '' he said. `` It would be time for a bit more of a full-scale investigation. We don`t feel safe because we can regain consciousness temporarily, he added. Doctors at Aju University Hospital are known to have left out the artificial breathing tube that was placed in the neck of the North Korean soldier. That means he's in good enough condition to breathe. Other sources said, It was more helpful not to get much antibiotics in North Korea. But the source also said, We can not guarantee a full recovery. The National Intelligence Service (NIS) believes that the North Korean soldiers who defect to the South are in their 20s sergeants who work at the Joint Security Area. When he defected on July 13, the North Korean military aimed at automatic rifles and 40 pistol shots. At this time, he was hit with five rounds of shoulder, abdomen and thighs. Since then, two surgeries have been performed by Professor Lee Kook-jong, a bullet wound specialist at Aju University Hospital. Lee was quoted as having treated the bullet wounds of Captain Seok Hae-kyun of the hijacked vessel during the Operation Dawn of Gulf of Aden, which rescued a hostage by Somali pirates in 2011. There were even news that it would be difficult to recover due to pneumonia, hepatitis B and blood poisoning on July 19, but the situation is improving. Lee Chul-jae, reporter of Seajay @ongang.co. krs, http://joongang.co.kr It is said that new clay minerals are created in the ground where tectonic plates conflict, and so the material properties and movement of tectonic plates can change. An international team led by Lee Yong-jae, a professor of Earth systems science at Yonsei University, revealed on July 21 that the hot and high temperatures of the tectonic plates caused "" super-superposed clay minerals "" to form. Superchlored clay minerals means minerals with water molecules in their ' kaolinite ' (karyngite) structures. Some water may be released again from minerals due to changes in the surrounding environment. The results of the study were published in Nature Geoscience, an international journal.A drawing depicting the supercooling phenomena of callinates in the subduction zone. The mantle supporting the tectonic plate continues to move as a liquid, and the mantle moves along with the crust. The water of the crust enters deep ground with a mantle, and it helps smooth the crust and movement of the mantle like an engine lubricant. As such, it is known that the amount of water in the ground is larger than the total amount of sea water. In particular, the subduction zone, where other plates of the Earth's crust fall under the tectonic plates, is a channel for water and is an area where earthquakes and volcanic activity is active. The researchers simulated the environment in the laboratory to see what was happening between the plates. The hot and high pressure environment in the ground can be made into a device called a diamond-anvil cell that holds two diamonds together.Researchers have mapped the study of the interior of the Earth with diamond anvilsella devices. After analyzing the material, the stone was turned into a type of substance, which is called ' super-hardening, ' or super-sized, rock with water molecules in it. The super-aged senior class was about 30 percent bigger than the senior citizens ' test results. Professor Lee Yong-jae said, "" Super high age seats on the surface of the subduction plates can alter (tectonic plates) properties and thus affect the occurrence of earthquakes. "" "" Understanding of the lipid phenomena observed on the earth's surface is possible by studying the ground "" and stated that "" in order to understand the changes in the deeper ground, an environment of millions of atmospheric levels was needed.

There are various connections between Seoul and MallI-dong, outside of Seoul, but the Seoul Station and Toegye-ro, respectively, are not enough. The Seoul Metropolitan Government announced on July 21 that its "" Urban Regeneration Plan around Seoul Station "" passed the Urban Regeneration Committee on July 20. The plan is a blueprint for fixing up the five-strong districts of Seoul Station, Namdaemun Market, Jungnim-dong, Seogye-dong and Hoehyeon-dong. The key is to connect the areas near Seoul Station, which are disconnected from the rail and road, to provide vitality. The Seoul Metropolitan Government is first considering linking the rooftop of Seoul Station's Minja Temple and Seoullo. Next year, it plans to invite famous architects to establish a master plan to reorganize its spaces. The nearby Bohaeng-gil (17 kilometers in total) connecting Seoul is extended to make the trail easier to walk along. Seven connecting streets will be extended, measuring 3.7km in total, and six alleys linking the street to local attractions and 10.5km in nearby alleys. As a result, the walking trails of Mallijae-ro, Cheongpa-ro, and Hanggangdae-ro will be maintained. It also plans to build a new link between Seoul and the Seoul Metropolitan Government. The basic design, which reflects the suggestion of Dutch architect Vinimas, will be developed and built in Seoul, and will be completed sometime next year. The museum also plans to create a plaza in front of Namdaemun Market and turn underground reporting into a cultural complex to boost Namdaemun Market. Local historical and cultural spaces become famous. The government will spend 4.9 billion won to build a Son's memorial project and build a space to commemorate Kang Se-hwang. She also tries to make it into a landmark in Yakhyeon Catholic Church. The residential environment improvement project will take place on the hills of Hoehyeon-dong and Hoehyeon - dong, where old houses are concentrated. The region had no home improvement due to expectations for large-scale development. The restoration project around Seoul Station will cost a public budget of 248.2 billion won until 2019. The Seoul Metropolitan Government has announced a plan to boost the local market and revive its facilities around Seoul Station with 6.6 million visitors so far, announced the Seoul Metropolitan Government in a statement. The area around Seogye-dong was designated as an area to provide urban environment. The Seoul Metropolitan Government expects the business, commerce, tourism, and accommodation functions to be strengthened when private investment projects occur in Seogye-dong, northern Seoul, and the urban environment readjustment projects around Seoul Station. With the completion of the plan, the residents will be able to successfully revive the cultural and cultural properties of the area, including the international gateway to the Eurasia Railroad era, the Seoul Metropolitan City Hall said. chopark@yna.co.krU.S. space agency astronaut Randy Bresnik showed pictures of Korea and Japan via his Twitter site Friday.Korea is located on the left, with the weather forecast to be cloudy, and Japan on the right.

First, the lights are a fish lantern, which can be seen as a fishing boat for squid. Also, the color of the lights in our country is mostly orange, whereas Japan is hidden in the clouds but it gives off a thick green light.

The National Assembly Legislation and Judiciary Committee is set to start an investigation into four cases involving the establishment of a public water ministry through a subcommittee. The ruling camp is speeding up its establishment of a public affairs office due to concerns that the prosecution could face a backlash due to an increase in the prosecutors ' situation against politicians and possible changes in the prosecution's power to check the prosecution. We plan to start a reform to divide the prosecution`s investigative rights, such as adjusting the right to investigate after the establishment of a public affairs office, a ruling party official said, adding, It is difficult to say that the prosecution is more powerful and internal. But in Korea such as the opposition, chief public Moon Jae-in, the president such as the ruling camp ‘Another would be placing a knife’ and concerns that the criticism is coming.

In addition, the situation is not easy for senior prosecutors to oppose the appointment of Constitutional Court justice nominee Lee Jin-seong, who indirectly expresses his opposition to the establishment of the court's investigation team through a written answer to the hearing. Some in the ruling party are also concerned that the ruling camp might have to go through conflicts with prosecutors throughout the entire administration after the ruling camp failed to reform the prosecution during the participatory government in 2003. A ruling party lawmaker said, "" Even then, the prosecution launched an investigation into political corruption, which allowed the ruling camp to follow suit, and made the Grand National Party's Public Prosecutors ' Office do away with the official investigation results.

The Hangyeong DB real estate market is showing a serious polarization. In Bundang, Gyeonggi Province, and Suseong District, Daegu, speculation zones also show no signs of stabilizing housing prices. Youngnam, South Gyeongsang Province, and Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province, is returning all of its gains from the peak.Bundang and Daegu Mercury saw apartment prices rise 1.10 percent and 1.13 percent, respectively, last week after the "" 9-5 measures, "" designated as overheated speculation zones, according to the Korea Institute of Audit and Inspection. It is the nation's highest rate of climb. Even after the August 2 Real Estate Measures, apartment prices rose sharply in these areas, which led to lower loan limits, but the excessive heat has not subsided. Experts say that housing prices in Bundang were also affected by rising housing prices in the nearby Gangnam area and also by development projects such as the Wirye New Town and Techno Valley. Daegu Mercury said, "" The repair project, such as regeneration of the old Do-sim, was favorable. ""Songpa district saw the highest increase of 1.90 percent during the same period. The price of the building was raised by 100 million won from September, as it was sold in the 76-150 million to 1.6 billion won reserved for the fifth floor of Jamsil Jugong. Local agencies said the bid has jumped by up to 75 million won over a week.Iksan in North Jeolla Province (1.26 percent), Mokpo (1.09 percent), Gimpo in Gyeonggi Province (1.03 percent), and Jung-gu in Daegu (1.01 percent) also saw high price increases. The "" second house "" fever has caused many of the apartments in the water-hungry resorts to rise significantly. East Sea (1.10 %) (1.03 %) Gangneung and Sokcho (0.72 %) and more than 1 percent greater increase than the entire (0.57 %), Seoul, Korea during the same period.Meanwhile, the areas designated as the "" central monitoring area "" through measures 9~5 appear to have cooled down. The central part of Ilsan, Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, was also criticized for avoiding designating speculative areas as overheated because it was the district of the Transport Minister Kim Hyun-mi, was the center of the city. Ilsan also experienced a far from overheating, with 0.20 percent of its residents having died in the heat. Bupyeong-gu, Incheon (0.28 %), Yeonsu-gu (0.51 %), and Jungwon-gu (0.52 %) also showed a relatively stable rise.Busan saw a rise in sales prices of - 0.11 percent, the only area to see a decline in the area. Haeundae district, which is subject to an application adjustment, was heavily regulated at - 0.29 percent. The Western economy also saw a mere 0.06 percent rise. Earlier, the government designated seven areas to be adjusted in Busan and Ilsan to be designated as areas to be closely monitored, and warned of excessive speculation at any time when housing prices appear abnormal.The polarization is becoming clear. The Youngnam region is growing worse. Changwon saw the prices of apartments in the Pohang area fall to minus 3.58 percent, followed by Uichang-gu (- 3.12 percent), Masanhappo-gu (- 2.08 percent), and MasanHoiwon-gu (- 1.45 percent) and Gwanak-gu (- 1.10 percent). In particular, the price of apartments in Shosong fell 10.60 percent from the end of last year, marking the only two-digit decline in the nation. In addition, regions in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province (- 1.94 percent), Ulsan, Buk-gu (- 1.63 percent), Gyeongju (- 1.59 percent), and Geoje (- 1.86 percent), South Gyeongsang Province were also affected. Experts say that the excessive supply worries coupled with sluggish long-range industries such as heavy industries have led to a fall in apartment prices.The real estate market is also expected to remain polarized next year.We expect the growth to continue in the popular areas such as Seoul, said Ko Joon-seok, director of Shinhan Financial Count`s real estate investment advisory center.Ham Young-jin, director of Real Estate 114 Research Center, said, It is inevitable that both the market and the market will polarize, adding, If the Bank of Korea could continue to raise the key interest rate, it will have an influence on the regulatory situation and the volume of new year moved in.Some regions are overheated, but the possibility of additional regulations targeting them is not very great. As the government announces its road map for housing welfare this month, we expect further regulations to follow, however, it is not a burden to aim at anyone in the race, not Seoul, Han said. The hospital in Aju University in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, is reportedly in the middle of psychological security therapy, with the Korean flag hung in the hospital of a North Korean soldier who was shot down and being treated. A South Korean government source said yesterday that he has regained consciousness by expressing his willingness to watch TV, adding, `` First of all, we have successfully returned to South Korea, and that is to provide a sense of security. '' The North Korean soldier was reportedly better, saying to medical teams at the hospital, "" Give me something to eat, "" and even pointing to the sore spots. The defectors are talking by expressing their exact intention to the medical team, and we are confident that the crisis is over, the source said. The hospital is known to have hung up the national flag on its hospital room to help North Korean soldiers who defected from the South regain their psychological security. Sources say, "" The defector who was shot is under severe fear and stress from the bullet wounds, "" and that "" We have secured the flag at the same time in a hospital to provide peace of mind that he was successful in South Korea. "" Some even argue that the North Korean soldier identified himself as Oh OO, a 25-year-old doctor at a medical clinic. As a result, no joint newspaper has been available yet. We have yet to identify them properly. Lee Kook-jong, a professor at Aju University Hospital, who operated on the defection of North Korea's soldiers, reportedly will give a briefing on the patient's condition on July 22. The government joint interrogation team, which consists of military and NIS officials, confirmed the defection in three to four days after receiving advice from Professor Lee Kook-jong, who was in charge of the operations. Meanwhile, the UNC is reportedly discussing with the South Korean military the announcement of its interim investigation into the event of the Joint Security Area (Joint Security Area) defection from the Panmunjeom on July 22. The UNC is reportedly considering releasing video footage of North Korean soldiers in the closed circuit TV and TOD (thermal observation device) of the North Korean military defection. A military source explained, In the TOD, a battalion commander and two noncommissioned officers took a North Korean defector who had been shot down at a South Korean military checkpoint and pulled to safety by a group of refugees 4 to 5 meters. threek@yna.co.kr"
"Samsung's Job Suitability Inspection (GSAT) field (NEWS 1) ─ News 1 Park Ji-hye's man, 3.17 million won, 1.2 million won, and workers at large corporations earned 4.44 million won and earned 2 million won. The median income of all Korean workers was 2.09 million won, and that of six out of 10 workers was less than 2.5 million won per month. The National Statistical Office conducted its first survey this year using government administrative statistics. The statistics indicate that the basis for the success of the current government's income driven growth theory is very weak. According to the National Statistical Office's report on the income of the job administration statistics for 2016, the average monthly income of wage earners was 2.81 million won and the median income was 2.29 million won. Median income is the median when the wages of all wage earners are arranged from high to low. Average earnings are ' illusion ' that some high income people are raising the overall level, while median income is close to the perceived income. The statistics are based on the most reliable administrative data used by the National Tax Service for health insurance, national pension and day laborers. It was based on the average pre-tax income of the jobs occupied by wage earners. The wage range from 1,045,000 won to 3,315,000 won is based on median income. About half of the workers in this section work. 31.0 percent of the people earned more than 31.5 million won and 20.1 percent of the people earned less than 104,500 won.Broken down into 10 sections, 58.5 percent of the total income was in the bottom three households with less than 2.5 million won. Among those who received less than 850,000 won, 16.4 percent, 16.5 percent from 850,000 won to 1,500,000 won, and 25.6 percent respectively. On the other hand, the top three sections were only 3.3 percent for less than 6.5 to 8 million won, 2.0 percent for less than 10 million won, and 1.7 percent for more than 10 million won. ② News 1 : The income gap between male and female designers and designers is also serious. The average gender income was 32.7 million won for men, 2.09 million won for women, 25.5 million won for the middle-level, and 1.16 million won for women. The gap between men's and women's incomes between the ages of 29 and below increased to 150,000 won, 680,000 won in their thirties, 1,160,000 won in their 40s and 5,150,000 won. The statistics also show the polarization between small and mid-sized enterprises. The average income of large companies by sales was 47.4 million won, whereas that of small businesses was 2.24 million won and that of non-profits companies 3.08 million won. By working category, 300 or more were paid 4 million won, 50 to 300 people were 260,000 won, and less than 50 people were 2,000,000 won. Large corporations saw their wages rise significantly as they get older, but small businesses saw little change. Workers at large companies earn 4.45 million won in their 30s, 5-5.5 million won in their 40s, and 6.3 million won, while small - and medium-sized businesses earn 2.46 million won in their 40s, 40-6.5 million won and 4.42 million won in their 50s. Statistics show that small business owners face their own lives while financial institutions and public firms earn high incomes, according to industry figures. By industry, finance and insurance businesses had the highest total value of 59.6 million won, followed by electricity, gas, steam and water projects with 58.3 million won, and public administration, defense, and social security administration with 3.9 million won. Meanwhile, accommodation and restaurant businesses were the lowest with an average of 1.87 million won. It was the order of 1,680,000 won in business facility management and business support service business, 2,130,000 won in health service and social welfare service. The average income per age group was highest among those in their 40s at 3.34 million won, followed by a salary of 50-1.8 million won, 3.06 million won in their 30s, 1.86 million won and 1.82 million won under the age of 29.To overcome the low income condition, we should create many good jobs with fewer non-regular workers and wage hikes, forcing the current size of the labor market to change to a dual structure, said an official at the ministry. ■ News 1 : Bang Eun-young, Designer's Chief of Staff, Choi Kyung-mo, 1950-1945 2017.05.24 (Photo = Ulsan Health Management Association provided) photo@newsis.com Health Insurance Corporation, Record of Health Examination for 2016, Examination by 77.7 % last year, and Normal decision decreased by 5.1 % over the next 5 years.▽ Cause of Aging = New South Korean media report : Six out of 10 Koreans who took a medical examination have a disease or are suspected. Four out of 10 men were also found to be smokers. According to the National Health Insurance Corp.'s 2016 Health Examination Statistics Report released yesterday, the rate of general checkup last year stood at 77.7 percent, 5.1 percent up from 72.6 percent in 2011. During the same period, the cancer screening test rate slightly decreased from 50.1 percent to 49.2 percent. In addition, 79.3 percent of the examination results were made during the lifetime, and 71.9 percent of the examination results for infants and children. Last year, the percentage of general checkup as "" normal "" was 42 percent, while 37.2 percent of those suspected of being ill and 20.8 percent of those who were in the hospitalist were found to be "" normal. "" During the same period, the cancer screening test rate slightly rose to 48.3 percent from 47.8 percent. In addition, health examination rates for infants were 77.1 % and examination rates for infants were 69.5 %. The trend is also related to the rapidly aging population, according to the analysis.

In addition, the smoking rate has continued to rise last year, although the overall smoking rate has been on the decline over the past five years.Among those who took a medical examination last year, the obesity rate slightly rose from 32.6 percent in 2003 to 34.9 percent. This is interpreted as the fact that Westernized eating habits have had a considerable influence on people's health. In particular, the percentage of obesity among men was 45.3 percent, and that of people in their 30s and 40s was 45.3 percent. On the other hand, the obesity rate for women was the highest among those in their 60s and 70s at 38.9 percent, but it was 27.6 percent for their age group. Overall, the smoking rate was 22.1 percent, 38.4 percent for men and 3.4 percent for women. The smoking rate for men in their 40s was 46.5 percent. While smoking rates have decreased due to the increase in cigarette prices and the government`s adoption of anti-smoking measures, the obesity rate has steadily increased due to the high-calorie intensive diet patterns, said an official at the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency. shoon@newsis.com> (Yonhap news agency) journalist Cho Jeong-ho : The 40-something man who saw the roaring car and threw a cup of soju at it for making a noise may have to pay 20 million won to repair it.Ferrari's Super Fast Release [Photo] [Yonhap] Italian supercar Ferrari revealed its 12th cylinder Berlinetta (2-door coupe) at the Geneva International Motor Show next month. ▽ United News = According to police on June 21, A (47) drinks soju with her husband at an eel restaurant in Songjeong Beach in Haeundae-gu, Busan at 11:30 p.m. on June 16.

"- Kyung-gang Line runs 18 times during peacetime, 26 times during the weekend - 51 times a day during the Olympic Games - "" We need to confirm some modifications to the general train plan "" graphics = 20 hours from next month when the train is being shipped from Gangneung, South Korea's capital city's train station The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport and Korail announced on December 21 that they have finalized their plans to operate the KTX service between Seoul and Gangneung, which is scheduled to open in December, along with regular train stations. In addition, through consultations with the organizing committee of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, the company has set up a plan to operate trains during the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. ◇ Eighteen peacetime weeks…Seoul to Gangneung 1:54, 22,760 won In peacetime, KTX runs 18 times per week and 26 times per weekend. The KTX, between Seoul and Gangneung, will allow one hour and 54 minutes from Seoul to Gangneung, and one hour and 26 minutes from Cheongnyang to Gangneung. The fare is set at 7600 won from Seoul Station to Gangneung, and 26,000 won from Cheongnyang Station to Gangneung. The station is running from Seoul Station 10 times during the week to CheongnyangnI Station 8 times during the week, Seoul Station 10 times during the weekend, and CheongnyangnI Station 16 times during the weekend. In contrast, Seoul direction starts from Gangneung Station on weekdays (18 times) and weekends (26 times).

Trains leave Seoul station at the 1st minute on schedule, CheongnyangnI station at the 22nd minute, and Gangneung station at the hour on the 30th minute. Some trains have a different running schedule depending on the KTX runs between Seoul and Gangneung. Whether it is necessary to eliminate train contention between Seoul and Gangneung by using the Gyeongwon Line (Yongsan - Cheongnyang-ri) and Chungangnyeonsu Line (Songnyang-Seowon) along with regular and electric trains. Therefore, ITX-Saemaul (Songnyang-Jung-cheon) departing from Cheongnyang-ri is reduced four times, and Mugunghwa trains can start two to three to five minutes later. The number of weekend trips between Cheongnyang-Jeongdongdong is decreased twice, but manjong station offers six more stops to facilitate KTX transfer. Electric trains and ITX-Brood trains will run at their usual intervals, but their average running time will be slightly longer due to increased evacuation time from KTX. ◇ 51 times during the Olympic Games … Incheon to Gangneung, Gangwon Province = During the Olympic Games, the train schedule will be changed six times to meet the diverse needs of hosting the Games until March next year when the Paralympics are completed.First of all, a total of 51 extra train runs during the month of February when the Olympics are to be held (one-way, weekday and weekend), and extra accommodation and train conditions will be considered during the period of high demand, including closing ceremony.

"○ Green-in-size the national cemetery, the national funeral parlor, and seven stamp-free burial facilities There is an "" eco-friendly funeral "" that looks for the best way to return to nature from the global village and an "" alternative funeral, "" which is completely moving away from traditional funerals. It is because the notion that all burial and bongang are violating the laws of the universe is widely prevalent. Especially, the high-tech funeral culture that pays tribute to the dead is in full swing with the digital age. Just as weddings and festivals change with the times, so does funerals. There are a series of unique funeral ideas that reveal the characteristics of modern society that value individuality and style. Although the relationship between the earth and the natural master of ceremonies is that of the universe, at a larger scale, it is from space. Whereas natural fields are concepts of returning to Earth, the universe's main emphasis is on returning to space. In Britain, funeral services for dust from space are thriving by spreading cremated remains of bodies in the stratosphere, according to the latest edition of U.S. magazine Atlantic. When latex balloon with hazardous debris is launched from the ground with rockets for more than 30 kilometers, it explodes in the stratosphere, turning it into space dust. "" We are all made up of the dust in the universe, "" stressed Ascension Flits, a British space agency. The company pays $ 1,040 (about 1,150,000 won) to pay for the rain. In addition, if the customer wishes to send the remains to higher ground, the range of the rocket will be adjusted to the desired distance for a higher price.Ascension Flarts was founded in 1997. The company held a funeral for Zin Rodenbury, a former Star Trek producer. His remains were cremated and flew over 90 kilometers from the ground. Harmful material entering into space often falls in rain or snow to the Earth.Natural burial is a method of inducing the body to naturally break down into harmless substances by microbes on Earth. Natural burial, so called green funerals, etc., vary from country to country. Korean arboretures are also a form of natural theatre. When you open a natural factory, you make coffins or a funeral urn out of materials that can easily decay instead of iron or jars. They make tubes out of bamboo or recycled card boards and also use banana leaves, cotton and wool to wrap the body.As one of the natural extension fields, ' Coral first ' appeared. If you make artificial coral reefs out of the remains of the cremation and drop them into a forest of coral reefs deep in the sea, fish, etc. will live there. Bio-cosmutting machinery, or biocostration, is being criticized for being not an environmentally friendly funeral method due to the emission of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel use and mercury vapor from the air. As an alternative, biocossing, or alkalization, was introduced. Bio-colouring is similar to the way humans used animal carcasses as fertilizer since 1800. The U.S. state of California enacted a law to legitimize biocostration, which is called "" water makeup, "" on July 15, and decided to implement it in earnest starting 2020. As a result, the number of bio-cosmutting states that have been legalized in the United States has increased to 15. If the bodies are buried as they are, they will decay and create bugs. Bio-cosmutting involves soaking the body in alkaline water and then dissolving it with heat.The human body is 65 percent water and 20 percent protein. The protein contains blood, muscle and collagen. Alkaline elements work to dissolve protein and fat in the body. After the bodies are dissolved, the remaining bones are powdered and given to the family. A cup of biocosting is similar to an Ivory type of sugar powder. In the United States, bio-cosmutting machines appeared about 10 years ago. The New York Times recently reported that Americans are increasingly looking for biocosting due to pollution and lack of cemeteries. Bio-colouring can be seen as a bizarre way, but advocates say it only condensed the process of returning human bodies to earth in a short time. Bio-colouring does not produce any environmental contaminants, stressed California Governor Jerry Brown.  Green-free gree-making cemeteries are appearing one after another, where corpses are dug into perishable coffins for burial. It also designated part of the cemetery as the Green Field District, and buried the body of the grave and sent it back to nature without any steles. In the United States, 41 states provide green-field cemeteries. They bath the body thoroughly in warm water and do not embay it. However, some use dry ice to slowly decay the bodies. However, if a corpse is buried without a coffin, it can sink after a certain time. Because of this, some cemeteries have a hybrid green market where floors are made of cement and bodies are kept buried.Digital funerals are traditionally a product of contemporary culture. As the digital age was developed in the 21st century, digital funerals came into play. In Japan and China, the ' QR code tombstone ' is popular. QR codes are similar to special symbols or hieroglyphics and contain more information than barcodes. If you scan the QR code, you can see photos or video clips of the person who passed away on to the website.China, the most populated country in the world, has a national funeral. China regulates the bodies from being left in tombs for more than seven years and uses advanced technologies such as the QR code to encourage people to honor the dead.Washington, D.C. = gukkiyeon The Segye Times media correspondent kuk@segye.com © 5 Kits combine an eye for the world, and global Indication for questioning the prosecution ... with the central jibeopsseo 22 detained last 11.(=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) Kim Kwan-jin Im Heon-Jung Journalist : Lee Myung-bak administration, a Cyber Army ` political interference online poll manipulation activities, which allegedly involved in (the military criminal law.Former Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin, arrested for misconduct and political involvement) restraint after the first to appear for questioning in Seocho-gu, Seoul on December 13, got out of the prison at the Seoul District Public Prosecutors ' Office.Indication on heading to. 2017.11.13 kane@yna.co.kr( : Seoul, Yonhap News Agency) songjinwon Journalist : Lee Myung-bak regime accused of operating activities involved in the online poll for the Armed Forces Cyber Command, Kim Kwan-jin, the Department of Defense.The arrest is reasonable to determine and arrest a fitness review in court.

"[Seoul Newspaper] World's No.1 adult ' Battle Ground ' game is about to be released in Korea for 15 years. But most of our children already enjoy adult versions freely and without restriction via American servers. It doesn't make any difference to me to purify the game and stop playing it after midnight. The current regulation is just a parental administration, "" said one 44, adding, "" If it weren't for the government to foster games as cultural content, it would have been illegal to look at games on the ground. ""Korean company, Blue Hole, the developer of Battleground, unveiled its first recognized adult service at Kakao Games in the middle of this month. A 15-three-fold game that passed deliberation last month is also scheduled to be released soon. To meet local regulations, the team cut out blood injection after switching to green.● "" Such efforts are of course necessary, but the problem is not resolved in Korea, "" said an official of the taxi industry and the taxi industry community, adding, "" In case of a PC game scandal, the monthly billing system for PC gamers is set at 500,000 won. ""Recently, not only the domestic game industry but also the information communication industry, venture industry, and distribution industry are appealing for "" reverse discrimination "" against foreign companies. The report argues that the gap is disadvantageous in domestic competition right now and is causing a widening gap with global leaders in future competitiveness.The ruling Grand National Party's (GNP) Representative's office of Kim Soo-min yesterday tried to hold a discussion meeting at the National Assembly's assembly hall in Yeouido to discuss ways to improve regulations on the development of mobility startups, including the carpool app. The Seoul Private Taxi Transport Association blocked the event. The venture industry has recently expressed regret over the Seoul Metropolitan Government's request to investigate the car pool app pool area and is facing growing conflicts with the taxi industry.Fullers offered a carpooling session in May last year (5-11 a.m. - 2:00 a.m.), but began 24-hour service with a rush hour option on July 6. Each driver can choose a four-hour commute. In response, the Seoul Metropolitan Government judged that it is an illegal distribution channel outside the legal limit.

Unlike Korea, the Fair Trade Commission of France has actively engaged in network pricing disputes so that its telecom companies can receive direct fees from Google starting in 2015.As Apple is known to have passed the advertising fee, event fee, and other expenses to the three mobile phone companies to purchase more than a certain amount, the controversy is growing over the company's eight-year plan.Recently Kim Bong-jin, the elegant brothers and sisters leader of the Korea Startup Forum, held at the Seoul Startup Hub in Gongdeok-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul, said, "" Korea is a major Internet powerhouse, but Korea is set up on top of it.

"▽ Chinese and Chinese online game Battleground=News 1 "" Battleground Ground "" sold through U.S. media outlets. Since the Chinese export blocked way earlier this year, a string of U.S. game makers have been acquired or released to the U.S. market. This year's biggest hit ' Battleground ' has become the first time it has become a hit. Nexon announced on July 14 that it will participate in the capital increase by investing 147.96 billion won in Nexon Corporation, the U.S. subsidiary of 100 % of Nexon Korea Holdings. Nexon U.S. Holdings plans to use the amount to buy Pixelbury Studios, an American mobile game company, and operate an American company. Pixelbury Studios is estimated to have about 100 billion won. This is the second time Nexon has spent a whopping 100 billion won on acquiring an American mobile game company, following the big Hughes Games, which developed Domi-Nations last March. Nexon has spent a fortune on its acquisition of Pixelbury Studios in order to win over American women in their teens and 50s. Pixelbury Studios is a development company that provides advice for girl-oriented games such as Choice and High School Story. Last year, the game was acquired by Nexon and has developed mainly for men's mobile games such as action. In other words, the acquisition of two game companies that are opposed to Nexon's creation of the U.S. mobile game market, which is aimed to further expand its influence in the U.S. mobile game market. Nexon is also seeking growth momentum for next year in the United States, including the launch of its wild mobile game Durango, targeting the U.S. market early next year. Blue Hole, which released a test version of its online game Battleground on the North America's largest game platform, was also a case of its success by entering the U.S. market. The Korean game giant gave up distribution and distribution through Korean game companies such as NCsoft Corp. and Nexon and decided to go directly into the U.S. market from the start. The battle royal genre of "" 100 People Complain for Their Lives by Competitive Edge "" became the world's biggest PC hit with 30 million copies sold in the U.S. market this year. As more Chinese users, especially those who are sensitive to the latest U.S. PC online games, flock to the battlefield, more than one million Chinese are enjoying battle ground at Steam every day. As a stepping stone to the success of the U.S. market, the Blue Hole is also in the process of exporting its products to Chinese game makers.In addition to PCs, Blue Hole is also marketed as the "" console, "" the most popular gaming device in the United States. Microsoft has signed an exclusive contract with Microsoft, and development is under way to be released next year. Netmarble and NCsoft are also working to increase the share of U.S. sales, instead of the clogged Chinese market. Netmarble first raised its share of its app market revenue to 24th percent in the U.S. last July, from last year's 1 trillion won acquisition of U.S. game company Karbam. This is similar to the Korean sales of 29 percent, which is larger than Japan (16 percent) and Southeast Asia (19 percent). Netmarble plans to increase U.S. sales to 30 percent in the fourth quarter of this year by launching Lineage II Revolution in the United States. The U.S. accounts for the largest share of net sales. The industry predicts Netmarble will also form a business alliance or M&A ; with Korean companies that have secured local operations there. NCsoft, which has established a local branch in North America since early, is also planning to expand its workforce by three developers. It is known that the U.S. is planning to develop a mobile game tailored for the U.S. with only about 100 developers in the U.S. set for release next year. "" We can't specify the size of the workforce, but we're still working to expand local resources outside of the Arena Net, Cabanen Studios, "" said an official at the European developer and developer, NCsoft Corp.,. Lsh 5998688 Collect news on CSAT! Various analyses are being made on the cause, and new possibilities are that it is the terrace-shaped feature. This is reporter Park So-yeon.[reporter] July 15 : Earthquakes had the shape of a basin that was surrounded by mountains on both sides of the west and east. The ground is deeply covered with soil, which is made by tiny fractures of rock into wind, water, and so on. In this sector-shaped landscape, when the ground shakes significantly in an earthquake, the accumulated soil goes down, the water goes up, making the ground softer and faster. Groundwater water can not escape to the surrounding areas and is very abundant. The problem is that this liquid phenomenon can cause the ground to sink as the structure changes.[Baekyong / Korea Institute of Construction Technology : Earth layer (ground) is disturbed. The ground beneath the structure is also dangerous because the structure of the soil is changed.However, there is no study on geological features anywhere in Korea, not only in Pohang, where the earthquake occurred. Signs of liquefaction are also being found not only in the vicinity of the epicenter but also in downtown Pohang, such as the school playground. As a result, many say that it is necessary to map out disaster risks, even if additional damages occur due to the liquid phase. (Pohang = Yonhap news agency) journalist Im Sang-hyeon : From July 22, refugees from Pohang will move to their new apartments. Pohang City decided to move to an apartment to the left wing of Korea Land and Housing Corporation after receiving requests from apartments that were to be torn down due to damaged or tilted houses due to earthquake. Among the six apartments in Daeseong, near the epicenter, the affected apartment complex consists of 3,170 apartments, four nearby Daedong Villas, and seven to eight apartments built with the PilottI method. The 22 households of Daedong Villa are scheduled to move into the apartment complex in Jangryang-dong, a left-side rental house. The rental housing is available in 160 households including 71 Humansia, Woosung Hanbit 25 in Cheongnim-dong, 5,000 Bogwang Apartment, and 10 Daegung Heights apartments daily. Most of the victims want to go to Humansia Apartment near the town of Heunghae-eup, so they will be assigned by lot if they want to. The sufferers can live here up to two years. Pohang City will pay the maximum rent of 100 million won. The occupants must pay water, electricity, gas charges, and other living expenses. The city will pay 1 million won per move to the homeless and secure 10 companies specializing in the relocation so as not to inconvenience them. We are making every effort to help would-be rental apartments move into the new apartments in the near future, a Pohang city official said. shlim@yna.co.kr"

"" A ministry official said yesterday, "" Deputy Prime Minister Kim will not discuss the whereabouts of the supervisor of the exam lab or the exam site because student safety is the most important factor in the priority. "" Based on the measures to avoid earthquakes announced by the Education Ministry earlier, the primary responsibility and authority to determine whether or not to suspend tests during an earthquake lies with the exam room supervisor. Students may have to evacuate the action scenarios set by the Korea Meteorological Administration and the Education Ministry before they pass through the examination room and are sent to the individual laboratories. The problem is that some of the classrooms, as the supervisor judged, stopped the test and evacuated to under the desk while others could take the test. This can create fairness and fairness among test-takers. In particular, the controversy could grow further if a response manual with the smallest ' family ' step (test carried out without interruption) was delivered when the test was evacuated under the desk. The same is true of violent vibrations when students need to evacuate to the playground. Whether to evacuate the building is decided mostly by the school superintendent or the director of the education office, who is in charge of the screening process. Once you are evacuated to the playground, the test is void. However, due to the university admission schedule that was delayed by one week, re-examination is virtually impossible and there are few other ways to save students. As a result, experts who lack expertise in earthquakes and officers in examination areas say it would be very burdensome to suspend tests when they feel vibrations. The government will pay legal support and the cost of filing lawsuits against students, said an official at the Education Ministry. cindy@yna.co.kr ▶ Report on the news at Daejeong Apartment in Pohang : Yoonjung, Pohang, a reporter who said, "" We are shooting Starbucks coffee in the 400 minutes.

"▽ Decrease in corporate debt and the increase of households and government = As the asset market is slower to restructure the expansion, the effect of fountain and the limits of economic stimulus are revealed, the key to income growth is the speed of debt. On November 21, 1997, the government announced its policy to apply for a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Just 20 years later, the Republic of Korea is on the brink of debt again.The Bank of Korea (BOK) surveyed in 1988, when the Seoul Olympics were held, had a sample debt ratio of 146 percent. Afterwards, about 300 percent of the respondents went through the roof and saw their share soar to 396 percent in 1997. The key to the foreign exchange crisis is that they made excessive investments with borrowed money and failed to repay it in time. A case in point is the bankruptcy of the April course, and one step in January 1997. Since then, a sharp decline in the value of Asia`s emerging currency, including Korea, has caused debt to soar, followed by a collapse of Ssangbang-wool, Kia Motors, Haitai, Nucoa, Korea Securities, Halla and Daewoo. In particular, the foreign exchange rate system and the bond market system have turned businesses into "" blind as a bat. "" The three pages of the article were related to the corporations ' restoration of their lives with public funds made from taxpayers ' money, and the exhausted foreign exchange reserves grew again with the help of gold articles out of the closet. Despite the loss of jobs and a decline in income, the loss of jobs has been attributed to the tax and loss of the people. The result is a shift in debt. The savings in 1996 were 52.8 trillion won for businesses (non financial) and 65.6 trillion won for households. When the crisis is corrected in 2000, the amount will be changed to 82.4 trillion won and 55.2 trillion won. The figure for late 2016 was 96.6 trillion won, or 136 trillion won.As debts shifted from businesses to households, so did the seeds of danger. The government has increased public spending and promoted consumption by using credit cards and developing real estate to boost the economy. The national debt exceeded 20 percent of GDP in 2003, down from 11.9 percent in 1997, and the gross domestic product (GDP) disposable income plummeted from 66.1 percent to 59.4 percent during the same period. When the global financial crisis broke out in 2008, which is called the "" debt crisis of advanced countries, "" the figure was not very high, with 28 percent and 57.4 percent, respectively. Household loans to GDP accounted for only about 65 percent, coping with the draft.Unlike the foreign exchange crisis, however, the global financial crisis has made the Korean economy no longer healthy. Ngo was, but Lee Myung-bak administration's exchange rate policy for the exporters didn't show up is ‘trickle down effect’ he shouted. Economic growth was below the potential rate of growth, but prices soared. Household businesses were inundated with surpluses along with record-high earnings, but their incomes remained flat. In particular, the increase in public spending will increase the national debt rapidly and the debt ratio will exceed the 30 percent mark. The U.S. oil shall oil revolution has not prepared for the storm that could have led to a sharp decline in raw material prices.Park Geun-hye, the government welfare spending is to enter the increased 40 percent of government debt. The drop in global oil prices has collapsed the oil price beneficiary industry and sent the jobless rate soaring. The low interest rate policy was adopted later than that of advanced countries, and Choi Kyung-hwan, then deputy prime minister for economic affairs, released regulations on housing and loan to boost the economy, leaving the ratio of household loans to GDP higher than 70 percent in 2014 and 80 percent in 2016. The unprecedented low interest rate delayed the restructuring of zombie businesses and resulted in debt based asset market growth. With polarization, young people are losing their dream. This is the economy of debt again after 20 years.The Bank of Korea's Monetary Policy Committee is certain to raise the key interest rate on Tuesday. It is a worldwide trend. Thanks to the booming exports of some semiconductors, and others, economic indicators are good. Fears over a correction in the Middle East have spurred oil prices to soar, setting up inflationary conditions. Interest burdens increase as interest rates rise. Although household debt bombs won't go off right now, they could really go off if the economy improves and interest rates don't get an increase in income. As the debt increases, the crisis approaches. Although the two crises have been overcome, the third and lasting crisis is sure to be far more powerful and deadly.Hong Kil-yong, journalist at /kyhong@heraldcorp.com To enable students to move to all of Pohang's applicants in case of emergency, 12 preliminary test centers are set up outside Pohang, including Yeongcheon and Gyeongsan. The Education Ministry announced on July 23 that it would continue the CSAT as scheduled without further postponement, even if a more severe earthquake occurred before the CSAT. The Education Ministry held a meeting of related ministries at Seoul National University on July 20 to finalize and announced measures to support applicants for the implementation of the CSAT and to operate the National Assembly in Pohang. He summarized his questions by questioning. Q. The status of the substitution test site in Pohang is .... A. Gaehang Fohang High School is in Pohang Iron & Steel, and Gaepo High School is in Ochun High School, and Gaseung Girls ' High School is in Pohang. The total number of students who changed places of examination was 2045. Please tell me about the schedule of studying in Pohang. A. Until 21st, students are instructed to take a test site inside and outside the pipe (if applicable) and to convene a preliminary meeting at 2:00 p.m. The preliminary calls shall be made at the place where the initial gathering was held on the 15th, not at the new test station. Students at the four schools that have changed their exam centers should learn the locations of their schools that have been changed. Q. If an aftershock occurs before the CSAT, it will be possible to get to the preliminary exam site on the day of the CSAT, as the aftershock is so severe that students on the exam day will move to the preliminary exam site individually. In this case, the ministry will provide 100,000 won per student for transportation or group transfer by school. If an aftershock occurs during the preliminary examination day (8:10 a.m. on July 23) after the pre-collection, it will be decided to move to an exam room outside of the jurisdiction on the day before traveling to groups. Q. How do you move in the latter case? A. Use a total of 250 buses pre-positioned at 12 test stations to move to a power group. The car must move to the 30 to 40 km the start of the test time is 1, is expected to delayed two hours. Q. If an aftershock occurs after the start of the CSAT ... A. The first priority for responding to an earthquake is to judge the school superintendent who is in charge of the test. According to the guidelines provided by the Education Ministry, the government will respond in three stages, ranging from minor vibrations to vibrations that could cause substantial harm. Q : What is the level of the responses in Step 3? A. Gar, a minor earthquake, continues to take the test without interruption, and the safety of the filter is not threatened. However, when the significant vibration occurs, he or she can stop the test and go under the desk to stabilize. A vibration of extreme degree that may cause actual damage in a store, ' siheom ' stops the test, recovers under the desk, and then, depending on the circumstances, exits to the playground. Each school head is immediately sent a text message to respond via a hotline established with the Korea Meteorological Administration, and the head of the school instructs the classroom to air immediately. Q. The criteria for the 3-step separation are ambiguous Classroom to classroom, judgment may vary. Even an earthquake like the one that hit ... A can have a very different intensity depending on the location of the school or the situation. As a result, it is difficult to prepare a manual that says, "" If the magnitude is right, do this. "" Therefore, the first priority of responding to aftershocks is to follow the decision of the head of the school's exam site. Q. Both students and inspectors have no practical training ... We plan to share specific actions during the preliminary meeting on A. 22. Q. Can I evacuate under my desk first before I tell my supervisor to. A. No. Shall move after direction of supervision. Q. If the situation of the examination is too unstable ... A. You can take the test in a separate room, such as the health center. Pohang Station will have two fire department officials and two rescue workers. Nevertheless, if the employee leaves the room without instructions from the supervisor, he/she shall give up the test. Q. Providing additional time for test interruption should give you about 10 minutes to relax your mind and body if you stop and reopen after ... The new test time is written by the supervisor on the blackboard in front of the classroom. Although termination times may vary for each room, the school's final end time is set for the end time of the last classroom. However, if an evacuation is carried out entirely outside the classroom, the test will be invalidated. In this case, the CSAT will be canceled for all applicants who apply to the school. As they can not apply for the examination due to the national disaster situation, they plan to make a separate proposal and announce it, but they need to discuss it further, and can not speak at this time. Q. Is the CSAT delayed again in case of additional strong earthquake? A. No. It is difficult to perform any more. If there is another strong earthquake, the national college entrance exam will be held on July 23, even if the exam is held outside Pohang.Lim Woo-sun, reporter imsun@donga.com"

[Photo : Kim Gyu-ri] The popularity of ' Long padding ' is on the rise this winter, as the cold spell continues to worsen. Created to commemorate the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, the film has become a "" precious body who can not afford to pay "" for itself by appearing on real-time search terms throughout the country and throughout the year. Some of the smaller stores have had police officers come in for customer disputes. It is a rare phenomenon in the fashion industry, which has been in a long-term slump due to sluggish consumption. According to the fashion industry on July 20, more than 50 outlets introduced padding with long sleeves that cover the knees during the past month. In addition to the sports-and-extreme brand, the company has also joined the manufacturing and distribution complex (SPA) and golf wear brands. Others say that the chronic disease of the industry, which used to be "" watching for the future, "" has reentered by jumping into the face of long padding.Kolon Sports has more than doubled the initial capacity of its long-down products over the past year. It extended its range to night trading styles, following the bench-down of its product capital, and the long-down of its hitting ticket-type. It has also introduced New Terranova Long, which has since become popular in 2013 and has since been reborn as a long-padded product.Vinfol Outdoor of Samsung Corp.'s fashion division has increased its long-padding output by 20 times from the previous year. It also plans to add items and colors to increase the number of consumer options to pre-empt market demand. Fila Korea also doubled its output of long-down jackets this year compared to the same period last year. In addition, most companies such as New Balance, Discovery, and Lecape prepare for the winter season by producing more long-padded products. The reason why fashion companies are so eager to see the longdown is because the reaction of the market has become so hot during the recession. Amid sluggish consumption, buyers often step up to the plate to ask when to get their out-of-stock products ready and find out whether to sell. As attention is focused on these companies, sales are also on the rise.Long-padded sales at Vinfol Outdoor increased by more than 300 percent at the end of last month from a year. Discovery Express posted 4.4 billion won and 5.6 billion won in sales on July 5 and 12, respectively. The figure shows that the figure has grown by more than 180 percent compared to last year. It broke the record for the second straight weekend of sales this month when the cold spell began.Since the launch of the women's long padding program, Red Face has sold 300 percent more in a row. However, some are concerned about the intensifying competition with similar brands pouring in. They are concerned that the nightmare of the onetime ' Premium Heavy Down ' might be revived. The burden of inventories failing to predict demand went entirely to outdoor companies. Companies that were anxious about inventory were cut 80 to 90 percent off, and did not worry about running out of stock."" As winter season is 30 to 40 percent, if you are cautious about the long padding market, you are going to have to jump in and see a chance that every brand is going to make you laugh, "" an industry insider said. "" But if brand is just as dull, you are going to buy a product with a brand.[Digital New York State's Kim Kyu-ri : Unrestricted Premium Ready from News.] Major news of the day [Daily Economics & mk.co.kr, Anti-Corruption Newspad] The Busan Police Agency announced yesterday that it has begun an internal investigation into Wormard. The National Police Agency ordered Busan Police Agency to investigate Wormard site, a controversial issue of sexual assault by Australian children, to investigate other warmard-related cases. Police will check the Warmard site operator and server and make extensive inquiries among those who uploaded the video for the first time in the country and distributed the video. The Warmard site, known as anti-masculine site, is controversial because it contains an article and video clip that said an Australian tourist had treated and raped an Australian child. As the comments and videos posted on the Warmard Web site become controversial, the presidential office has filed a petition on the petition board saying, ' Please force the Warmard Web site to close. ' osh9981@yna.co.kr is seeking a new year's leave of absence from the office to the next year. New employees who do not have an annual leave of absence on the first year of employment are entitled to an annual leave of up to 11 days. The government announced at a Cabinet meeting on July 21 that it hired three different laws yesterday : equal compensation for men and women, support for working men and their families, the Labor Standards Act, and the Employment Promotion and Rehabilitation of Disabled Persons Act. The revision will take effect in May next year, about six months after it was promulgated. ◇ Strengthens protection measures for sexual harassment victims = The revision of the Act on Equal Employment and Support for Work-Home Compatibility contained a clause that reinforced the responsibility of the employer for sexual harassment in the workplace and the protection of the victims. In the event of a sexual harassment incident, a business owner's inspection of the facts, change of work place to protect injured or injured workers, or grant paid vacation time were required. In the event of a violation, a fine of less than five million won was imposed. The ban on the dismissal of workers or victims who reported sexual harassment at work was raised to 30 million won from the current 20 million won in violation. The employer was required to provide protection against the injured, such as a change of deployment or paid vacation order, in the event of customers ' sexual harassment, and a fine of not more than 3 million won is imposed in case of violation. The revision also introduced "" Nanim Treatment Leave "" of three days a year (first one day paid, second day unpaid) for patients who have had to deal with the increasing number of patients who have had to attend the exams every year. Last year, the number of patients who received medical treatment amounted to 218,000, but they had to take annual leave of their own to treat their illnesses. Lim Seo-jung, director of the Employment and Labor Ministry's policy office, announces measures to eliminate sexual harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace at the media room of the ministry's Sejong Center for the Performing Arts Wednesday. November 14, 1717.14 / News 1 / News 1 ─ News 1 Chang Soo-young guarantees yearly leave of absence from work for new employees and childcare … According to the revision of the Labor Standards Law, new employees are required to take annual leave for up to get paid for the first year and second year. Until now, it has been pointed out that workers working less than one year can not get sufficient rest because they are deducted from the annual vacation date of the following year when they are absent for one month. In addition, the government will strengthen the guarantee of the annual leave of absence from childcare for workers who return to work. Until now, when the annual leave count (80 percent per year) is not considered to be for childcare leave, so workers who returned to work after childcare leave can not take an annual paid vacation next year. The revision considered the term of childcare leave to be at work when calculating the number of vacation days per year, allowing workers who returned to work after childcare leave to be guaranteed annual leave. Under the revision to the Employment Promotion and Rehabilitation of Disabled Persons Act, the education duty of employers to improve the perception of the disabled was newly established and imposed fines of less than 3 million won for violations. Also, the Act provided that the Government, local governments, and public institutions should provide preferential treatment for businesses that are selected by the Minister of Employment for the Disabled in connection with contracts for construction, goods and services."
"【 Seoul : New Sis-Display. (New Sis DB) Health Insurance Non-Provocate Insurance in Seoul : "" The cost of vaccination against influenza was different from the cost of Seoul = New Sis&amp;Park's vaccine was expensive. "" Choi's so-called "" vaccination "" is due to the price of vaccines, which vary from hospital to hospital. Hospitals nearby paid 3-4,000 won per person for the vaccination based on the flu vaccine, 4 different vaccines against influenza virus. Feeling the heavy cost, Choi went to other local hospitals, which cost 16,000 won per person and could be vaccinated. As a housewife, I had to consider the financial aspects of getting vaccinated against the flu virus for my family of four, Choi said, I was confused because each hospital cost me different amounts of it. # 2. Office worker Kim (36) was recently vaccinated against the flu at home. She was beaten by her wife after asking a former nurse. A friend of mine also asked for the flu vaccine. Kim paid 15,000 won for the vaccination. However, the medical practice of nonmedical doctors constitutes a violation of the current medical law. "" It's a different inoculation rate for each hospital and, most importantly, the same vaccine, I don't see why it would cost me more and get beaten up, "" Kim said, referring to the volunteers and pharmaceutical workers around the house. People are confused as vaccines are in full swing to prevent the flu from spreading in the winter and hospitals have different rates. Extradition is seen as a cheaper option, and many non-disposal patients, including pharmaceutical employees, are secretly injected. New Sis reporters in Seoul checked the flu vaccination cost of 10 hospitals and clinics and found that the vaccination cost varies from as little as 14,000 won. And 4 Ga vaccine also cost 3 ~ 50,000 won, different inoculation fee per hospital. Among hospitals that have high vaccination costs, some say expensive vaccines are more effective. A flu vaccine should be suitable for effective imports and good ones, a hospital official explained. However, vaccines used by the hospital were confirmed to be the same as vaccines used by other low-cost hospitals. They also stressed that hospitals that have relatively low vaccination costs have no choice but to lower their vaccination costs by using the ` crying ` method. One doctor at a private hospital said, "" We don't have a problem with simply having to charge for getting vaccinated, we don't have a problem with what it costs. "" "" We just have to pay for the medical care, labor, rent, and storing the vaccine. "" "" The flu shots are one of the things that hospitals can make a profit from, but they don't necessarily make a big profit either, "" he added, adding that hospitals are only paying off each other's benefits. It has been confirmed that medical institutions with non-profit organizations such as the Korean Health Management Association and the Population and Health Welfare Association cost 25,000-27,000 won less in inoculation costs than those of disease and disease clinics. A nonprofit health agency official said, "" They are cheaper to get vaccinated because they make a small profit and make a large purchase. "" That is not the case with vaccines used in other hospitals. Citizens who are confused over the vaccination fees, which is different from hospital to hospital, are complaining. "" It is quite a difference if you charge 5,000 won per person on a family of four basis, "" Choi Seon-yoon, 45, said. "" As a matter of fact, I know vaccines are more affordable in many places, but I have to get vaccinated every year. University student Ahn Seon-young, 23, said, If the effects were similar, would I have paid more for the vaccines I received? But flu vaccines are not a priority ; hospitals can set any vaccination charges. Although the cost of flu vaccines is debated all the year round, the government says it can not get involved. An official at the CDC said, "" A flu vaccination is a non-pay option for the medical institution to determine the costs "" and has a legal requirement that the Government can not directly address the inoculation cost. sky0322@newsis.com> Despite the forecast of lower unit prices, the amount of facility investment is rising to reach 29.5 trillion won as the number of sanitary high places around the world is growing. Samsung Electronics is pouring its money into semiconductor facility investment this year. ▽ Memory semiconductor 〓 As the world semiconductor industry is tense over Samsung Electronics ' reckless investment, many interpretations of the reasons for the astronomical investment are being made.According to the industry on July 20, Samsung Electronics ' plan to invest in semiconductor facilities by the end of the year more than doubled from last year's 13.15 trillion won, resulting in an increase of 124 percent. Thirteen percent of semiconductor facility investment increased the most since 2010, and the same percentage of semiconductor facility investment increased dramatically in 2013 (- 9 percent) and last year (- 10.6 percent), respectively, considering the decreased investment. Compared with the growth rate of investment in display facilities (43 percent), which costs 14.1 trillion won, semiconductor growth is even higher.The total amount of facility investment this year by global semiconductor manufacturers, estimated by global market research firm IC Insight, is $ 90.8 billion (approximately 100 trillion won), which is one third of Samsung's total investment. SK Hynix invested a record 9.6 trillion won this year, but it has more than the combined amount of TSMC, the U.S. powerhouse of integrated memory chip maker Intel and foundry (semiconductor processing).Samsung is also investing in DRAM chips, in addition to the Poundry Micro-Process Line at its Pyongtaek campus. While Samsung Electronics is officially in favor of increasing memory demand, the industry is trying to beat its rivals ` initial push to chase the drop in prices despite short-term price drops due to a supply increase. It is aimed at Japanese Toshiba Memory, which has completed its sales and is seeking a comeback, and Chinese companies that will start mass production in the second half of next year. Ju Dae-young, an honorary researcher at the Korea Institute of Industrial Economics and Trade, said, "" Samsung Electronics has the know-how to win the game with DRAM chips in the 2000s. In the short run, Samsung's preemptive investment will slow down the price of DRAM chips. ""Samsung's large-scale investment is not just about "" chasing and kicking the rival "". The refinement of the semiconductor process has reached its limit, and the amount of investment in the high places per unit has increased. If the finished products were made with 300 processes in the past, the investment is growing as more than 500 of them have to be processed. This means that Korea should continue to make substantial investment in order to stay at No.1.As the total number of U.S. battlefield employees ' mergers and acquisitions (M&As), which appeared to have taken over the U.S. battlefield Haman last year, could prove to be on track. It may be a long-term warning that no major investment is seen in new areas other than the ones that are usually good at, said an industry official.Kim Chang-hoon, reporter of Samsung Electronics ' Pyeongtaek-taek semiconductor plant, Line 1, Supplied to Work For Last July.

"Kim Jong Un, head of the ruling Workers ` Party, and head of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, recently analyzed that "" the North Korea's National Assembly's top advisor for fear and punishment, disappeared due to massive attack on the North`s founder Kim Jong Un after the Korean Revolution and September issue of his actions, "" adding, "" The head of the hard-line National Assembly's intelligence unit for the military's hard-line policy stance was unendered. "" Late last year, Kim Jong-un visited the Sun Palace in Geumsusan (middle), Yonghae (right), and Geumsusan (first). Hwang Byung-seo, a political advisor to Kim Jong-un, disappeared from the official performance list on September 21 after a map of an orchard located in Hwanghae-do, South Jeolla Province. The last public event was the "" 70 Anniversary Report Contest for the Cultural Revolution School and the Kangbanseok Revolution School "" on July 12 at Mankyong University. The NIS explained to the National Assembly`s Intelligence Committee on July 20 that it had punished Hwang Byung-seo, vice chairman of the ruling Workers ` Party, and Kim Won-hong, head of the political bureau. If the punishment is true, it means it is after October 12. Kim Jong-un has been breaking up mainly with Labour party officials since taking office. Jang Song Seong-taek, the head of the party's administrative department, is a typical figure. Last year, North Korea's National Security Agency officials were purged and executed (firing squad). It was not a calm island. Lee Young-ho, chief of the Army's General Staff, and others were executed. Only the ruling general government of the armed forces remained strong. The General Government is the most powerful agency in the country. However, if punishment of Hwang and Kim is true, the ruling Workers ` Party → Information Service → the Military Intelligence Service → the Central Government Policy Bureau, which served as punishment for those who served as punishment for those who served as punishment for those who were punished by Hwang Byung-seo and Kim Won-hong.The NIS said it was confirming the level of punishment. The North Korean criminal law provides for the execution, jail time, organic jail time, labor training, disenfranchisement, seizure of property, disemployment and suspension of eligibility. However, it is analyzed that in this case, the Labor Party's bylaw is more likely to apply to the case than to the criminal code. Penalties to party executives ▶ Convicted by a revolution (those who work in a local factory or on a farm and write an apology). stripped of their party affiliation. Conducted and executed (firing squad) Jang was dismissed from the party and executed. Kim was reinvestigated in April when he was given the National Security Council award and returned to the political bureau in April, but was re-imposed in six months. The process of revolutionary work and writing an apology is one of the most common punishments for party officials, said a senior defector who wishes to remain anonymous. If punishment is imposed on Hwang, who is in the middle of the power succession with Choi Yong-hae, the chairman of the ruling party, and the vice chairman of the ruling party, it will not recognize the second power figure with a political intention to deny the monopoly of certain power agencies. In fact, Kim Jong Un executed Chang Myung-tak, his uncle who was considered the second best, and then punished Choi Yong-hae, who was also called the second best, for his revolutionary actions. The official analyzed, "" The fact that Choi Yong-hae made Hwang Byung-seo and Kim Won-hong punished is a move to stop certain power agencies from playing solo without bloodletting their hands. "" Just as Choi Yong-hae introduced Hwang Byung-seo, Kim Jong Un has employed a technique of controlling loyalty by having power agencies or power elite, including the execution of Chang Seong-taek as the head of the National Security Agency. Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korean studies professor at Dongguk University in Seoul, said Kim Jong-un has stabilized some of his regime over the past five years, playing the role of a group of former wives of his father's generation who could have been found more personally involved. North Korea experts also point out that the fact that the international community is imposing strict sanctions against the North is also causing North Korea to be restricted. Analysts say China, which has served as the North's rear door and has been acting as the back door since then, has recently participated in sanctions, creating a mood of fear to prevent any deviation of the residents. Professor Jun Hyun-jun of Wooseok University said, North Korea is pushing for no action by the North to escape the residents ` attention by punishing agricultural secretaries during times of hardship in the late 1990s. The NIS announced on July 2 that it had revolutionized the life of the officials of the Rodong Sinmun company for not posting the missile launching ceremony on the front page, and announced the execution of corruption on the part of the political ministry in Pyongyang. Observers cautiously say the North may have to do with stopping further provocations after Sept. 15 and the budding mood of dialogue between the two countries. They say that it might be a proactive measure to counter hard-liners in order to change the hard-line stance of the North, the U.S., or the South. In particular, less than 50 percent of those in their 40s or older were diagnosed with "" normal. "" According to the National Health Insurance Corporation's ' Statistics Report for 2016 Health Examination ' released on July 21, the number of people who received the first round of general examination last year was found to have reached 37.7 million to have received the first round of examination, but the ratio of ' Healthy A ' was not necessary. The percentage of people with "" suspicious diseases "" was 37.2 % and 20.8 % were diagnosed with "" cases of diseases. "" About six out of ten people who suffer from an illness or who are suspected to have an examination have the disease, 58.0 percent have the disease. Compared to 2011, the summit was reported to have decreased by 7.4 percent, and the proportion of patients suspected of suspected disease and foreclosures increased 1.7 percent and 5.7 percent, respectively. The decline in the normal scores compared to 2011 also appears to have affected an increase in the number of senior citizens who were screened due to an aging population, the Korea Health Insurance Corp. said. By age, 74.6 percent of patients in their 20s or younger were found to be normal, and 24.9 percent of patients in their 20s or younger were suspected of having a disease and only 0.5 percent were patients who were being foreclosed. Those in their thirties were found to have more than half (56.5 percent) of the normal rate. However, the average ratio of people in their 40s was less than half, with 47.0 percent, 34.6 percent, 60-24.7 percent, 70-165 percent, and 12.3 percent, respectively. As a result of the first screening, 557,835 people were diagnosed with high blood pressure and diabetes, of whom 212,821 had high blood pressure tests and 34,821 were diagnosed with diabetes last year. The number of people diagnosed with diabetes was 107,471, or 50.5 percent. The high blood pressure index was estimated at 52.1 percent (179,848). Compared to diabetes of 41.3 % and hypertension of 47.8 % in 2011, the rate increased by 9.2 % and 4.3 % respectively.Last year, the obesity rate stood at 34.9 percent for men, 41.3 percent for men and 27.6 percent for women. Men in their 30s were the highest with 46.0 percent of obesity, and women in their 70s had the highest with 40.4 percent.Last year, the smoking rate was 22.1 percent for all health examination questions, with 38.4 percent for men and 3.4 percent for women. Smoking rate has dropped steadily since 2011 to 21.9 percent in 2015, when cigarette prices rose 2,000 won, but rose slightly last year. Last year, 49.2 percent of cancer patients in their fifth generation were diagnosed with cancer. Cancer in the liver (65.4 percent), breast cancer (63.0 percent), stomach cancer (59.4 percent), cervical cancer (53.0 percent), and colon cancer (35.7 percent) were also highly tested. The Health Ministry and the National Cancer Center announced that they have tested lung cancer at 14 institutions nationwide since April, with 3,112 patients being examined for lung cancer.
