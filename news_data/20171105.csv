"I set my alarm clock for 7 a.m. and I fell asleep, but I'm sure you'll find an eye-opening experience from 6:40 a.m. I even wonder if I'll get out of bed or get up a little bit faster if I wake up early the weekend I turned off my alarm. Obviously, I was so tired the night before I thought I fell asleep, but why did I wake up before the alarm started ringing?In fact, scientific secrets are hidden here.■ On weekends, it is because of a bio-clock alarm.We have biological clocks in our body. Biochronic clocks are principles in which our bodies can change temperature, heartbeat, hormone production, and so forth as the Earth rotates day and night. This year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was honored for its proof of its biochronology that affects sleep, body temperature and metabolism.Physiology laureates have discovered that the protein concentration changes at once every 24 hours to match biological rhythms. PER protein is also known to influence sleep cycles. It is the PER that makes me feel tired when I'm awake at my usual time.Getting out of bed is the same principle. On weekdays when you go to work or school, your body relays getting up at a certain time, and when you remember that, you make your body clock beats and you wake up at the same time that you rest, and you make your heart beat.■ Why did you work in a dark cave in 24 hours?In fact, there is an interesting study that involves biological clocks. In 1962, French cave explorer and geologist Michel Siffre spent nearly two months in an underground ice cave and lived in isolation. I started to experience physical activities in person, wondering if they were regular without light or clock.He began to confuse the time and the date with the day after. After 10 days of wild living in the caves, he also mistook night for day. However, the results were surprising for the researchers who looked at the capsule. The cycles at which Sifre wakes, eats, and sleeps are regular at about 245 hours.French astronomer Jean-Jacques Dortu de Meran (Jean Jacques de Ortous de Mairan) proven biochronography with plants. During the day, he planted a mimosa, a dog-shaped bird that stretched out into the sun and folded at night, in a sunless underground wine cellar. The researchers found that mimosas spread and folded their leaves at the same time that they did when they were outside without sunlight. Since then, many scientists have discovered that not only plants, but also animals and human bodies have ' biorhythm ' in their cycles.■ Alarm is too noisy … Another reason why we wake up before our body sounds is because of stress is because of stress. As negative experiences of hearing and waking up from a loud alarm are repeated and learned, the body inherently initiates rejection. Recently, American magazine Reader's Digest even introduced a statement by sleep experts that "" our bodies instinctively open their eyes to avoid stress from loud alarms. ""Studies show that the body releases cortisol, one of the steroid hormones, one of the early morning periods throughout the night. Cortisol is a hormone released to fight acute stress. Before you wake up, your body is under stress from worries about pressure to wake up, loud weather alarms, and so on. Sometimes it's fun to rent in the tourist areas, but you can get into trouble if you don't have a driver's license.It was reported by Jeon Hyung-woo.Last August, Choi fell down with his two sons on an electric kickboard and was seriously injured.[Mr Choi / Accident victim : The film went off completely when accelerating. After the surgery, I was almost paralyzed, unable to move at all, but within a week, I moved my hands and feet slightly.] When I asked the rental company for damages, they replied that they had no insurance and were not responsible for the electric kickboards.Choi had requested an investigation from the police because she suspected a faulty electric scooter, but when she returned, she was fined 300,000 won.His son rode on an electric scooter because he drove without a license.[Mr Choi] Accident victim : No license talk. If there were, we would have thought it carefully.] I went to a rental company and borrowed an electric scooter.[Borrower worker : This is the brake, this is the accelerator.

According to a report submitted by the Seoul Metropolitan Government to the National Assembly's National Territory and Transportation Committee member Ahn Kyu-bak, a 57-year-old man who drove a corporate taxi was struck out late June. This is the second time that Korea was disqualified from charging foreigners too much. Seoul City has been implementing a three-strike-out system since last February, in which the driver's license is revoked for one year if he or she is caught illegally collecting the fees three times or more. You need to get a new license when the one-year cancellation period ends. The first strike out was made in early June this year. Kang, a taxi driver at a company, received 15,000 won, five times more than the basic fare of 3,000 won from Myeongdong Korea Exchange Bank to the Hotel in South Gate. He received five to twelve times the original fare. Min, who was the second executioner, was caught last October for taking a bus with a foreigner and receiving a normal fee of 30,000 won from Dongdaemun Earth's Shopping Center to Shilla's Stay. Min, who received a fine of 200,000 won and a warning, overcharged the foreign passengers again next month. I took about 10,000 won from Dongdaemun WPA shopping mall to Jangan-dong Kyungnam Tourist Hotel and received 60,000 won. The second detection carries a fine of 400,000 won and is subject to a 30-day suspension. Min, who was rearranged as a driver, was caught again after earning 20,000 won while driving 1.3 kilometers from Seongyu station in Myeong-dong station to Sindang station. A foreigner who he thought was too expensive to use as a taxi report to the Korea Tourism Organization, and when the corporation asked the city to investigate, he was fined 600,000 won and revoked.Foreign tourists visiting Myeong-dong [Yonhap news release photo] said, We expect a steady stream of stringouts, adding, We have two taxi drivers scheduled to take out. If the city reports unfair fees, it will take administrative actions by hearing drivers ' opinions after direct investigation. Seoul city is cracking down on taxi fares everyday from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. near major tourist attractions such as Dongdaemun and Myeong-dong, by hiring foreigners fluent in Chinese, Japanese, and other languages. When foreign tourists get out of taxis, they are getting overcharged by asking where they got on the bus, and what the fare was. Last year, the Korea Tourism Organization reported 164 touch-related reports to the Center for Complaint Prevention, accounting for 13.7 percent of the total. It is the second most accepted area after reports of inconveniences with shopping (342 cases · 28.5 %). The number of reports that foreigners were charged an unfair taxi fare was 18.5 per month from January last year to March this year, down from an average of 30.8 per month. The number of reports has decreased since the Seoul Metropolitan Government strengthened its crackdown by taking over the disposition of illegally charged taxi drivers from district offices in March this year. The city government is considering collecting authority to punish not only for the unfair fare but also for denying taxis. Ahn Kyu-bak said, Although the number of reports of unfair taxi fares has decreased, they have not been eliminated yet, and should be more thorough in cracking down on the charges against foreigners as they are a classic example of undermining Korea`s image.

International researchers, including Swiss university of Zurich Alexander Neiter and Professor Michel Krutzen, say they have discovered a completely different species of orangutan found on Sumatra. The researchers reported their findings in the journal Current Biology, which published the results of their study, which showed a genetic difference between traditional Sumatra orangutans. The third orangutan, ' Pongo tapanuliensis, ' (TapanulianI orangutan), lives only in the highland jungles of Sumatra, Indonesia, ' Batang Toru. ' It is estimated that only about 800 live in forests that cover 1,000 square kilometers. The orangutan has been categorized as two species : the Sumatra orangutan and the Borneo orangutan. The orangutan's presence in the base of Sumatra began in the 1930s, but scientists began their study in 1997. So far, the study has shown that the orangutans in Tapanuli are behaviorally different from the other Sumatra orangutans. However, in 2013, a large quantity of orangutan remains able to do genetic research, and when analyzed by 37 orangutan genes, it was discovered that they were completely different species. The Tabanuli orangutan, McShime Alley in Sumatra, Indonesia, and the skull of the Tabanuli orangutan's skull and skeleton confirmed it as new species, according to a DNA test. Compared to other orangutans who are also offered such as Alexander Neiter, Thaphaz has small skull and narrow jaws. Whooper Genetic research reveals Tappa is the oldest orangutan, separated and settled about 3.4 million years ago. It then separated into Sumatra orangutans and Borneo orangutans 674,000 years ago. Professor Alexander Neiter said, "" Thappa is the direct descendant of the first orangutan to travel to mainland Asia. "" Tapanuli's home is located at the southern tip of Sumatra's orangutan settlement. If academic circles regard the Tapanuli orangutan as their official bell, the number of apes other than humans will grow to seven. The academic world currently defines six species of animals as apes : chimpanzees, bonobos, Borneo orangutans, Sumatra orangutans, western gorillas and eastern gorillas. Environment Agency for the Conservation of Sumatra Oranguans (SOCP) claimed the construction of dams and gold mines are seriously destroying Tapanuli orangutan habitats in Battoru. `` The discovery of a new species is something to celebrate, but habitat destruction can cause us to lose it. If you think about the future, you should try to protect your habitat.

According to the May 5 Independence Foundation, a series of reports and reports by three-man airborne personnel were discovered in an investigation into possible burial sites at a former Gwangju prison, and several reports were made. A major, who was the main commander of the 3-man brigade, told a Seoul District Public Prosecutors ' Office investigation on May 29, ' We buried our bodies about two meters apart from the prison wall, ' and ' rice fields and fields were overgrown with weeds at the front ' about five to three meters. The foundation, based on Kim`s statement and a memo from Kim, designated the location of the probe. Among the 300 meters wide and 5 to 5 meters long outside the prison's northern fence, the area is about 117 meters long. As a neighborhood site, it was used as a farm due to the patrols by the Airborne Forces in May 1980, and the 16th Brigade of the 3rd Airborne Brigade was stationed there. The three airborne crew members also confessed their conscience. Kim, a sergeant at the 3rd Airborne 15-story battalion who was stationed at the jail on May 18, tipped off the foundations about the sale of the weapons personally on September 19. He said, ' We shot our troops aimed at cars on the highway, collected bodies in the overturned car and left them there for a day. I did not participate in the burial, but I reeked of five or seven bodies because the body was left unattended, ' she informed the foundation. ' Because there were no coffins, I buried them. The information was also specific, such as ' I asked you if you have an I.D. on your chest. ' Staff Kim said, "" At that time, the body burial was led by 15 battalions. "" He also participated in an on-site investigation conducted by the foundation last month and pointed out the specific locations. It is my first time here since May 18th, Kim said, adding that I feel good talking about everything. Lee, who belongs to the 11th Battalion of the 3rd Airborne, testified similarly. I buried eight people directly near the warden's residence, Lee said. Lee reported such information in January 1989 and continued to dig up the remains, but the remains were not recovered. The military document, "" Report on the Situation of Cancer Field at Gwangju Prison, "" compiled by the 511 Minute Stone Team in January of the same year, concludes that "" prison inmates die in prison during an annual strike. "" In fact, Lee testified before the official residence, in which the bodies of eight people buried on the ground were recovered on May 30, 1980, shortly after the king withdrew from the palace. The foundation is also planning to investigate the two sites to find the burial grounds. There are two more places. It is the place where an inmate who was imprisoned in Gwangju on May 18 said he saw someone dig with heavy equipment. Choi, who was detained at a Gwangju prison in May 1980, said, All ordinary prisoners can not go back to their rooms and leave by 5 p.m. The criminals were relatively free at all hours. One day he saw Forcraine work outside the prison. It was two areas, but it was kind of a sunken valley. We will bury bodies among the criminals, he said. After conducting an on-site investigation with an informant, the foundation confirmed that the area was completely outside the prison's northern fence, bringing in new tennis courts, buildings used by prison guards, and parking lots. As it is close to the primary excavation site, it is highly possible that excavation research will be carried out immediately depending on the location of the remains. Kim Yang-rae, executive director of the Foundation, said, I hope the hearts reach heaven and the missing persons return to the arms of their families in 37 years. guggy@newsis.com>"

Prime Minister Hariri announced on July 4 (local time) that he would resign from his post in an Arab televised speech during his visit to Saudi Arabia. He denounced Iran and its ally, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, as he said he felt threatened with assassination. "" Unfortunately, I did not stop Iran from interfering in our internal affairs and infringing on our sovereignty, "" Hariri said, adding, `` I do not want to disappoint the people of Lebanon and I want to back down from my principles. '' `` The evil Iran spreads in the Middle East will face a backlash, '' he said, denouncing Iran as the territory's hand is being cut off. Hariri reaffirmed his opposition to using Hezbollah's force against Lebanon and its Syrian people. Hezbollah has been involved in Syria's affairs and has support for Syrian forces. Hariri said in his speech that he felt threatened by the assassination, and suspected Hezbollah was behind it. `` It's a very similar atmosphere to the assassination of Rafik al-HariI, '' he said. `` I have detected a conspiracy against my life. '' Hariri met with Iranian top leader Ali Akhbar BelaatI in Beirut the previous day to discuss international affairs. Lebanese Prime Minister Hari-ri Hari-ri (right) meets Thursday in Beirut, the middle of Iran's top leader's international affairs advisor. [EPA = Combined News] Rafik al-HariI is the father of the current Prime Minister, who served as prime minister for a total of 10 years in the 1990s and early 2000s. Hariri died in a February 2005 bomb attack by suspected Hezbollah followers. Hariri, born in Saudi Arabia and run a construction company, entered the Lebanese political arena after the assassination of her father. He led the Sunni anti- Syrian political bloc in the 2005 and 2009 elections. Most of them, except for the time when they formed an alliance with Hezbollah with their backs against ShI'ites Manghua, competed against or clashed. Hezbollah, Hariri was last year to shake hands with a start his own Cabinet as a result of Michel Aoun to support the candidate for president and was able to return to the prime minister. However, Hezbollah and ShI'ites, which have become more influential due to the recent development in Syria, have put a lot of pressure on Hariri. Prime Minister Hariri's abrupt resignation and criticism of Iran-Hizbullah raised the possibility of Lebanon falling into sectarian violence. The confrontation between the pro-SaudI and pro-Japan parties is likely to intensify. Iran is plotting to say that the United States and Saudi Arabia are behind Hariri's resignation.

High school entrance exams do not reflect a junior high school record. The Ministry of Education announced its plans on July 5 to expand and develop the free semester system for middle schools. The free-learning system refers to the practice of various career paths and discussion and participation programs during a semester without taking written exams, such as the midterm and final exams. After a trial run in 2014, it has been operating in 3210 schools nationwide since 2016.Beginning next year, a free-learning school year system will be adopted that extends the free-learning semester to freshmen. According to research conducted by the Korea Hope School, 1,470 middle schools nationwide announced plans to participate in the free-school program. It is about 46 percent of all middle schools. The middle schools that have a free year program will operate by expanding their free-learning activities from the current 170 hours to 221 hours per year.516 middle schools plan to have linked semesters after their free semesters. After free semester, he still works for 51 hours during the semester. The rest of the schools are operating free semesters in the first, second, and second grades. The grades of first graders who will participate in the free-school schoolers next year will not be reflected in the 2021 admission process when they go to high school. The first attempt is expected to announce the decision in March next year when the Office of Education announced its plan to introduce high school entrance into the nation. Seoul, Gyeonggi Province and Gangwon announced plans in March to introduce high school admission for the 2018 academic year, signaling that they would exclude the entire junior high school record from the admission process. Other education offices are also considering ways to prevent students who attend the free semester of their freshman year by not reflecting their entire grades in admission tests. The ministry is scheduled to complete revisions to the Enforcement Decree of the Elementary and Middle Schools Education Act by this month to prepare a basis for promoting the free-school school system. It is designed to allow students to operate the free semester for one or two semesters in the current school. The Education Administration Information System (NEIS) is also improved to record assessment results for students during the free-school year on the school life register. Assessment of academic activities during the two semesters in the first grade, such as the current free semester, should be changed to allow for sentence entry. The government also provides a special grant to keep the free semester system in good shape. Schools that only offer free school semester apply for 18 million won. Schools that have a free year program will receive an additional 10 million won, and schools operating under the program will receive an additional 7 million won. In addition, it will support customized counseling by school, and discover and spread cases of local class innovations. It will continue to explore quality test sites and programs and assign high quality experience programs to schools in farming, fishing villages and small and middle-town areas.

According to the industry on July 5, about 140,000 iPhones were opened for two days after it was released on July 3. This is 60 to 70 percent of the iPhone 7 released last year. The number of mobile phone users of the three companies was 31,122 on July 3 and 28,602 on November 4.

IPhone 7, which was released in October last year, sold 200,000 units as prospective buyers flocked two days after its release. The response was negative compared to the initial surge of 20,000 units per day for the past three weeks or more.The reaction was expected from pre-sales. Three domestic mobile phone companies began accepting pre-order sales of the iPhone 8 on July 27, but only about 60-70 percent of the iPhone 7 showed signs of failure.The sluggish iPhone 8 is not only local but also primary drivers - the United States, Japan and China.

In Japan, where the iPhone series has a high market share, sales of iPhone 8 series after its release decreased by 31 percent from the previous iPhone 7. China is already offering a huge discount on the iPhone 8 ahead of the release of the iPhone X earlier this month. Foreign news agencies such as Bloomberg reported that the iPhone 8 was disappointed to see itself being relegated to its own brand in the Chinese market.The classic iPhone 8 is because it has little distinction with the iPhone 7 and is not chosen by the consumers between the upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone Ⅹ .. In addition, Apple did not even explain its defective battery swelling, so the safety issue remains controversial.Although the local launch schedule for the iPhone Dialogy has not been set, it is expected to be released by December as Apple announced its domestic prices.

"[Graphic] Korea's smoking rate was 39 percent last year, and the smoking rate of the OECD's top tier of smokers is still on the decline, but the smoking rate of the OECD's top smoking group (Yonhap News Agency) was found on July 4. According to the International Statistical Almanac recently released by the National Statistical Office, smoking rates for Korean men over the age of 19 last year were 39.1 percent. 44.9 % in 2012. Although the smoking rate is gradually decreasing compared to 43.3 % in 2014, it is estimated to be the leading smoking rate compared to other member countries of OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development). According to OECD statistics, smoking rates among Korean men aged 15 and older were 31 percent in 2015, the highest among the 15 nations with the same smoking rates. In the survey, Japan ranked second with 30 percent and Italy ranked third with 25 percent. As of 2014, Korea ranked second among 29 countries in the statistical market, trailing Turkey, which reported 41.8 percent of 15-year-olds and older with 36.6 percent of the smoking rate. The survey showed that the number of developed countries was much lower than that of Korea, with 14.0 percent of the U.S., 20.0 percent of the U.K., 25.8 percent of France, and 163 percent of Canada. In the 2006-2013 survey, the smoking rate of Korean men aged 15 and over has never been lower than that of other OECD countries. Though it is difficult to compare smokers en masse due to different countries ' different smoking rates, Korea is estimated to be one of the top OECD countries in terms of smoking rates. Drinking is also on the rise. The per capita alcohol consumption (age 15 and older) increased to 9.1 liters in 2015, down from 8.7 liters per person in 2013.

Free Korea Party leader Hong Joon-pyo Yeouido Park Geun-hye in a press conference held by the company over the past three days ago publicly announced the expulsion of a president to leave behind. The ruling camp of the conservative camp of reporters in Seoul, Lim Hyun-dong, has reached a new stage. Hong Joon-pyo free Korea Party leader Park Geun-hye, former president called to press ahead with a chuldang action. Hong's face on the sixth floor of the office in Yeouido at 6 p.m. on July 3 was grim. Hong said “free Korea to reinvent itself as the main hall of the conservative South Korea ‘Park Geun-hye of the party’ to free itself from Iran, deemed it can't help.” said. The president had kicked out of the party he had worked 20 years from 1997 that became the first president of the moment. Officials said more reporters seemed to flock here than during the last presidential election. In fact, it was a predictable result to some extent. Over the last Hong Park on August 16, were “the president chuldang The problem is, from the party in the future will discuss in earnest” for the president's political hometown.Declared war since words. The pro-Park group's ‘Hong Joon-pyo force minus’ and “Hong By his own trial on bribery charges under whom, but that chuldang?” but has been intensifying their efforts to promote the stars.There is no income. Already politically and purposes of the deaths received the president to chuldang's possibly deter the yoke of harsh, isn't it? compassion be well-received by Rondo.I did. It is because the dominant sentiment is that the party should make a fresh start to boost its sluggish popularity before the local elections next year. “president, Korea is chuldang signal of innovation, not the last stop.” is a party officials said. I said ━ the right party eight to nine from the party to six days before the president seems to be chuldang on wavelengths are more than a few conservatives. Most of all, lawmakers Kim Moo-sung and other righteous political parties will have the opportunity to head to the Korea Party. These are integrated as a prerequisite for the new party before the president has been for the chuldang. Hong said, We did not make such a decision to make room for a few rightwing party members to return, stressing the responsibility of conservative groups in Korea, adding that it is a key point to the ruling camp. However, it is also hard to ignore that the ruling party's abolition was the first time it was combined with the right party, gaining more momentum and becoming a topic of public controversy. Now, attention is focused on the scale of the right party members ' defection. If nothing big happens, it is likely that 8-9 members of the coalition, including Kim Moo-sung, Lee Jong-gu, Hwang Yong-cheol, Kim Yong-tae and Kim Young-woo, will leave the party on July 6. Though the proper general assembly of party members is scheduled to be held on July 5, it is highly likely that the meeting will end after confirming the difference between the union and the pro-integration camp. I will not have to agree if I don`t mention what I failed to say at the general meeting on July 1, but I can not but agree when I say that I will go to the convention as planned. In a café in Shinchon, Seoul on July 3, a proper political party held in the first to the debates, the leadership campaign selling 자강하다 make strenuous efforts, such as Rep. Yoo Seung-min, hataegyeong a will to ‘My Way’.Established. Rhyu said, If we share the same opinion of reform and repair, we can consolidate even tomorrow. Those who would rather go to the GNP without any efforts to make such an unity could hardly understand it. I really want to ask them what they have done to ensure the success of the party since it was established in January, he said. Ha also said, "" A smaller number of members of the right party will only raise the approval rating, "" adding, Koreans are determined by reinventing their support based not by how many lawmakers are born but by how many members they support. The surge in party support since the mass defection from the ruling party immediately before the presidential election has also encouraged them. On the floor, the support of the right party to the end of its existence, combined with the concern of how to lead conservative unity should the negotiating group collapse. Even after the integration of Harry, various scandals are expected to continue even after the defection of some of the party members who are still correct. Suh Chung-won, and Rep. Choi Kyoung-hwan of the title of party affiliation, Korea the pro-Park Geun-hye faction in the key problems remain. The parties are strongly opposing the punishment for encouraging the GNP committee to leave. In order to get them out, a general meeting of the lawmakers is required to obtain at least two-thirds of the approval of incumbent lawmakers. We will discuss with floor leader Chung Woo-taek over time, Hong said, expressing his intention to hold off on us for now. Facebook, however, is threatening to take strong measures such as saying, "" Now, stop making a fool of yourself and, if you mess up the party and your country like this, reflect on yourself and leave quietly. "" The pro-Park group's Hong Park former president chuldang, but also order for pointing out. Gimtaeeum The key issue in accordance with rules and constitution supreme council meeting saying they want to, consultation at, in accordance with paragraph 3 and Clause 21, Hong said the ethics committee.President left the pitch can discipline did not object to the dismissed to situation. The biggest challenge for the right party is whether to successfully stage the national convention and win the unified front. Gyeonggi Governor Nam Kyung-pil and Rep. What does it mean to form a new leadership when the right party is again divided? Six people who ran for the presidency of the right party, including Rhyu, were told in an emergency statement on July 3, We hope to receive applause and clear conservative unity from the people, and the leadership would be guaranteed to do so immediately. After the leadership completes its initial battle, it is expected to maximize its ' clarity competition ' with the Korea Party. The people don`t know what is better for the right party than the Korea Party, Ha said, insisting that the party's approval rating should rise and drop, and that it would start by encouraging people to change their regime. Whether the "" right party "" and the People's Party's Solidarity for Policy, which were launched on July 3, are bearing fruit is another important aspect. At a joint news conference, the two floor leaders agreed to work together to pass six bills, including the Broadcasting Service Act, the Special Inspector General's Law and the Regulatory Free Zone Act. Moon Jae-in government examination at Johns Hopkins University, predicted a microscope by defining “short-term populism without his efforts to ensure financial health budget” the first budget.

"▽ New South Korean students ' dream is to go on an exhibition titled ` Happiness education for free semester ` at KINTEX in Goyang City, Gyeonggi Province on July 20. Students are going to have a talk about their happiness at the Exhibition. 2016.10.20. stoweon@newsis.com The idea of a free-school student system to help freshmen to explore their careers through various experiences without taking a midterm or final exam during the two semesters is shared. The question is whether a free-school system can provide good career opportunities. Even now, there are many trials and errors in the process of the free school term system, such as regional disparity and poor management of career programs. Local middle school teachers who taught free-learning programs said, Students have many jobs they want to experience, and most of them have to go to vocational training centers to avoid paying their respects. A parent of a middle school student in Seoul said, "" Now that my child is an artist, he or she wants to enter art class, he or she can choose not to participate in rock lessons. Rather, it is unsatisfactory that it has only improved performance assessment. It is also uncertain how teachers who gave the keys to the success of the free-school school system can actively participate in the program. Teachers still claim to have a burden of work by organizing and operating their own experience programs, and also taking charge of learning paths and experiences in addition to course classes. A middle school teacher in Seoul said, "" Both the free semester and the free year system are voluntarily administered by the principal of the middle school, and teachers can only compete with each other to get operational results. "" Another teacher, D, wrote in a sentence that says, "" (Free semester) does not have a positive effect on discovering a child's dream and aptitude. "" Even though it is written in the student body, "" It is still a stressful sentence. "" Some say that pre-learning is rampant during the free-learning system, just like the free-learning system, because the curriculum of junior and senior students stays the same under the university entrance system. If the amount of public support grows for parents who want to supplement private education, the idea of a free school system can become blurred. The government is planning to provide more favorable support for the free school term and the school year in order to operate freely at schools. The ministry said, "" We will first assign high quality experience programs to schools in farming, fishing villages and small cities, and we will continue to explore quality research institutes and programs by strengthening cooperation with administrative agencies, private universities and universities. "" We will also conduct joint inspections with the education office and other institutes, which use the free semester or the free school year to promote anxiety among parents and encourage private education. positive100@newsis.com> Korea Park Geun-hye, former president of the free <anchor> chuldang to right party the course of the party of the reorganization of the conservative opposition movement began a general meeting of a little bit.I started, I am.

"▽ Bloomberg Communications Acquisition of $ 100 Million = Qualcomm shares the largest transaction ever ; KRW 1.1 billion of the global equity fund, and it is estimated that the independent drive car, cloud, and IoT market will grow to become the world's top merger.Once this deal is completed, the price of the semiconductor company is expected to reach an all-time high. As the market of semi-conducting chips has expanded from mobile to autonomous vehicles, Internet clouds, and Internet of Things (IoT), the industry is forecast to experience a change in perception.Amid the sharp rise in Qualcomm shares, Bloomberg quoted an anonymous official as saying Broadcom is discussing a proposal to acquire Qualcomm at about $ 70 a share. The exact acquisition price was not set, but the company expects to set the market record for the highest bid of more than $ 100 billion.When the news of the acquisition spread, Qualcomm rose nearly 19 % in New York, but closed up 13 %. Market capitalization has increased to $ 91 billion. Broadcom shares also rose 5.5 percent to $ 112 billion.Broadcom, acquired by Avago Technologies Ltd. in Singapore last year for $ 37 billion, is the world`s fourth-largest maker of anti-chip chips after Intel Electronics Co. and Qualcomm. The main products of the market are corporate network chips such as Wi-Fi broadband. It produces a variety of products such as chips for smartphones and set-top boxes. Broadcom, like Qualcomm, is a factorless company.Qualcomm gained the lead in the mobile chip market in recent years, exclusively supplying chips to Apple's iPhones. Almost every smartphone sold around the world has Qualcomm's chip patent technology.The relationship between Broadcom and Qualcomm went back 13 years to patent litigation. In 2004, Broadcom sued Qualcomm for infringing on digital video technologies and received a damages of $ 911 million after a five-year legal battle. At the time, the media had estimated that Goliath was defeated by David Broadcom.Broadcom's acquisition of Qualcomm gives it mobile chip technology. However, antitrust authorities can intervene in the overlapping areas of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.Although it is not clear whether the White House requested the acquisition or Qualcomm would make any decision, many analysts say the M&A ; is a breakthrough for Qualcomm, which is in the status of "" independent source. "" Qualcomm is being investigated for unfair trading practices by U.S. and other global antitrust agencies. In China, South Korea, and Taiwan, a total of more than 5 trillion won in fines were imposed.Qualcomm is also facing its biggest crisis this year due to a patent dispute with Apple. The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple will use chips from Intel and other companies instead of Qualcomm chips next year. Stacie Rathgon Burns, research analyst at Burns Bystain Research, said Broadcom is known to handle litigation issues, adding, We have resolved the dispute between CEO Hawktan Broadcom and Apple.The American president is Donald Trump insuan, It was reported to the White House invitation to a ceo. The U.S. government explained that it had requested the U.S. company to acquire Qualcomm in order to solve the problem of unfair transaction fines. To the news of over one day before Trump White House press conference was president from Broadcom's Singapore headquarters two days prior to the United States announced.The CEO responded, "" I have decided to move to the headquarters, hoping that the U.S. would benefit from corporate tax reduction. "" Broadcom was an American company based in Irvine, California before being taken over by Abago Technologies.^ Self-running borrowing chips market expansion Broadcom and Qualcomm`s M&A ; promotion reflects the recent seismic shift that has occurred in the semiconductor industry. As the price competition thickens, semiconductor companies seek to grow their sales by becoming bigger. As anti-communication chips for wireless communication are used, ranging from mobile to cars, doorbell, and factory facilities, the industry's competition to secure digital technologies is intensifying. Autonomous cars are considered the semiconductor market's biggest market because they need 616 chips that are granular enough to detect blind spots.The joint venture with the semiconductor industry was launched last year when Qualcomm proposed a $ 3.9 billion acquisition of BJB (NXP). NXP is the company that took over the Freescale for $ 12 billion and grew to be the # 1 semi-conducting semi-conducting chip market.It was also reported that Marvel Technology is pushing for a acquisition of Kabium. Together, the two companies will create a $ 14 billion cloud service chip maker.

King Abdul Aziz al-SaudI, 82, who is expected to resign between the end of this year and the beginning of next year, will concentrate on establishing an anti-corruption commission as a royal order to secure the next throne.Former Saudi royal family members including Saudi Minister of State SPA and Arabic news agency Al-Arabiya TV were arrested Thursday on corruption charges by government authorities, including billionaire Al-Walid bin Talak, and former Saudi royal family members of Muhal al-JaafI. Due to the replacement of top military leaders such as Secretary Muthar Eve, the Crown Prince Mohammed has virtually gained full control of the Saudi army.Even princes normally privileged within Saudi Arabia have been arrested without a stop because of the overwhelming power of the Anti-Corrupti-Corruptivity Committee that King Salman left to the Prince. King Salman ordered the creation of an anticorruption commission in the Imperial regime just hours before the news of his arrest. The Corruption`s corruptionary immediately issued an arrest warrant, and was empowered to order travel restrictions and a freeze on property, if any, related to public funds, according to SPA.Prince Mohamed and Saudi government officials, who are pushing for a social and economic reform plan, apparently say, "" There is no economic reform, regardless of rank, without fighting corruption. "" But Western media, including the Wall Street Journal, observed that the prince focused on power before he abdicated his father, under the pretext of pursuing reform. Saudi authorities arrested scores of clergy in September protesting measures to increase women's rights pushed by Crown Prince Mohammed, and they also have a strong warning to block a balanced diplomacy between Saudi and Iran. In addition, some reports say that the former first in line to the throne, Prince Mohamed Bin Nayef, who apparently gave up his crown post in June this year, is currently under house arrest.In addition, Donald Trump by the United States president to partner Mohammed's crown prince of the new Middle East strategy, not make it, they said that, too.

"[Seoul Newspaper] I drank, but I paid attention and went through drinking and driving experience. It is in a drunk driving test conducted at the Traffic Safety Education Center at the Sangju Traffic Safety Authority, North Gyeongsang Province on July 2. But ' mental power ' collapsed in vain before drinking. No matter how hard I focused on driving, I didn't feel like myself. It was an experiment to learn that a 1m stopping distance difference could affect a person's life when braking. When previously sober, the driving was smooth. Playing the cone around the road on the S-shaped course was only an indication of a lack of basic driving. The ' Risk Management Course ', which measures the ability to respond to emergencies, and the ' Body Control Course, ' which measures the ability to respond in wet, snowy conditions, were also a breeze while asleep.Park Ki-seok, a reporter at the Seoul paper, slips in his car yesterday afternoon during a car control course at the Sangju Traffic Safety Center in North Gyeongsang Province.Sangju journalist, Park Ji-hwan, popocar@seoul.co.kr But after drinking a bottle of soju, she became tipsy and tipsy. Drinking tests showed a "" license cancellation "" level of 0.1 % of alcohol in the blood. He was so drunk. However, I felt that it would not affect my ride. Furthermore, he was full of confidence because he had already ridden the boat three times while on a non-drinking boat. I even thought I could drive better while I was drunk. There was some confidence added to it from drinking.But as soon as I started driving, I knew it was a big mistake. I knocked down three cones on the S-course. The distance between the car and the cone is not well understood. Without more attention to the operation, the frequency was slightly faster from 19.7 to 19.0 seconds. When the green signals were turned into red signals on the risk-averse course, the distance was increased by about 2m. The speed of the brakes ' application was slow. The stopping distance determines the fatality rate of drunk traffic accidents, said Ha Seong-soo, a professor at the Traffic Safety Education Center at Sangju, Gangwon Province, saying, The difference of 10cm between crashes and road crashes.Not only the speed of recognition and response after drinking, but also the ability to operate a steering wheel significantly decreased. The body-controlled course caused a "" spin "" phenomenon, as a road device hit the rear wheels, causing the car to slide over the edge or into the snow. When he was sober, he turned the car around immediately, but when he was sober, it was not possible either. Embarrassed, he turned the steering wheel violently, pressing on the accelerator and brakes, and repeatedly made mistakes.After the second experiment, he took a break for about two and a half hours while drinking water. As the alcohol wore off, his mind was becoming distinctly clear. I began to feel like I was sober. When we measured the alcohol concentration in the blood, it was 0.08 %. Though the index failed to fall to 0.05 percent, which is the standard of detection of alcohol use, the number of people staying in the country avoided cancellation of their licenses. I took the wheel again and took the course three times. Since the alcohol levels in the blood decreased more than they did shortly after they were drunk, they expected the results to be closer to being empty. However, the results were worse than when they were driving right after drinking. The number of times he hit the cone by leaving the road from the S-shaped course has increased to five. After watching the red light, I stepped on the brake, and the stopping distance was longer than 2 meters. This means that the ratio of the non-alcoholic drink state is increased by 4m. Alcohol levels decreased, but the ability to perceive, judge and exercise a person's space got worse.According to the five-day traffic safety agency, one to two glasses of soju (0.02 to 0.05 percent of alcohol in the blood) reduces vision by 15 percent compared to normal, reduces speed estimation accuracy, decreased sensitivity to red light and shade. Drinking 3 to 5 glasses (0.06 to 0.09 %) reduces vision by 25 % and delays reaction time by 40 to 50 %. Concentration and space perception are also impaired.

"Uncomfortable air flow in the U.S., South Korea over McMaster “will not give up South Korea's sovereignty” the president, diplomatic balance between the issue of the United States and States and not excessive military alliance work."" The international community to suppress North Korea in increased co-operation 韓 uncomfortable atmosphere in promoting dialogue, South Korea concerns U.S. and crisscrossing, South Korea over McMaster “will not give up South Korea's sovereignty” the door.President, on balance between the foreign “US-Japan military alliance and a pressure would not.” of the United States and the international community pressure increased co-operation propulsion ━ are concerns in advance, U.S. and crisscrossing 韓 the conversation.The Korea-U.S. summit, a major watershed in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue to Donald Trump, president of America's first Asian tour began three days (local time). Following the U.S. visit to Hawaii, it is Japan (July 5-7), Korea (July 8-8), China (July 8-10), and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit (2010-12) and the ASEAN (2010-12). Trump, president of her trip to Asia's top issue is very far from the North Korean nuclear issue. U.S. National Security Adviser Herbert McMaster stressed at a briefing on July 2 (local time) that the top priority is strengthening the international community's resolve to disarm North Korea. On the other hand, "" Trump as well as allies, including the North Korea, Japan, is president and the United States as much as a threat to every country around the world were more to confront the threat of North Korea.Will highlight the fact that efforts should be clear. '' It is the final decision of the Trump administration's North Korea policy, the "" peaceful pressure campaign. "" There is such a phrase as "" Trump and Abe's Neighbourliness "" that the U.S. and Japan have a cooperative system to pressure North Korea. Meanwhile, in Korea, before a two-day state visit, a "" $ 3-way, 31-Chinese agreement "" on the placement of the Korea's high-altitude missile defense system was adopted as a "" Yangseo-Korea Agreement. "" It is because the nature of the issue, the Korea-U.S. summit meeting, can be another negative factor that will negatively affect the future Korea-U.S. relationship. The "" 3-dollar stance "" of the two sides on the "" India-Pacific Initiative "" was presented by Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa during a parliamentary audit on July 30, one day before the agreement between Korea and China. Korea does not consider additional deployment of the THAAD missiles defense (MD) system in the United States and says Seoul and Tokyo will not develop security cooperation as a military alliance. Moon Jae-in Singapore took a step further in an interview with Channel News Asia (cna) president has three days. Diplomatic relations with China, to respect the president is “A tripartite military alliance is for States and Japan to the level of development is undesirable.” and said, "" with the United States, more door.Have to make balanced diplomacy to do. "" The United States did not hide its uneasy feelings about the move. `` From what I have seen, I don`t think the Foreign Minister says is definitive, '' McMaster said. `` I don`t think Korea will abandon its sovereignty in three areas. It is interpreted that he will believe Korea's explanation that it only reaffirms its existing stance at this point, but does not affect future security decisions. Fearing a backlash, the Korean government is actively evolving. We consulted closely with the United States during the consultation process with China when we announced the agreement, a senior presidential official explained, We were careful not to have any unnecessary misunderstanding or friction in the Korea-U.S. alliance. Another high-ranking official stressed, "" The U.S. also told China that the THAAD was not directed toward a third country (China), "" adding, "" It played a big role for the United States (in the process of this agreement). "" Trump, the government president visit that has been postponed until now the brink of notice to release its own sanctions. But the situation is serious. Above all, the government's $ 3 stance is in conflict with the free and open Indian and Pacific Initiative that it has promoted since the inauguration of the Trump administration and its efforts to strengthen security cooperation between the United States and Japan. This idea is one-for-one in China last year, is Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, (安倍晋三) (一帶一路) strategy in order to check the Trump plan presented by the president accepted. The basic concept is to check the expansion of China by inviting Australia and India to the U.S.-Japan security alliance. China is rightly furious at the idea of creating a kind of Asia-Pacific Treaty Organization (NATO). To draw South Korea into the initiative, the United States and Japan have been making an incomparably more all-out demand for the North Korean nuclear standoff, under the pretext of pressuring China to solve it. The first Korea-U.S. summit joint statement in June reflected the phrase of progress in security and defense cooperation between Korea, the United States and Japan at the strong request of the United States. At last month's SCM, U.S. Defense Secretary James Matiz stressed "" the peace of Korea and the Pacific alliance "" by citing Vice President Mike Fench's remark during his April visit to Korea. In addition, Japan called for the conclusion of the mutual logistics support agreement (ACSA) between Korea, Japan and Japan at the Korea-Japan diplomatic vice ministerial meeting last month. The ACSA aims to provide ammunition during wartime, fuel and food, as well as other military supplies. It was promoted along with the GSOMIA in 2012, but failed due to public opposition in Korea Woo Jeong-yup, a researcher at Sejong Institute, said, The Korea-Chinese THAAD deal was meant to prestress China's already strong stance of easing the face of the United States before the summit. Professor Kim Han-kwon of the National University of Foreign Affairs at Seoul said, China's change of stance is likely to provoke a negative reaction to the Korean and Japanese national security system, as China's criticism and opinions on strengthening the Korea-U.S. alliance grew in Korea following the THAAD retaliation. U.S. diplomatic officials also point out that the U.S. pressure on China on China from the standpoint of the U.S. played a key role in easing China's retaliation with the THAAD system, and that Korea was opposed to the U.S. ' efforts to check China. The fact that the government is seeking to consult with North Korea with China with the THAAD agreement is a shadow on the future relationship between Seoul and Washington. The White House senior official North Korean nuclear threat in the Korean National Assembly speech is the telephone briefing on August 31 last month, "" Trump president for up to the international community against North Korea.Sends a message asking to join the pressure on the ambassador said. In addition, 7, first official visit to Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province for a visit to the U.S. bases in the Trump be a strong message to North Korea's president.Likely that coming, too. Experts, however, worry that the recent South Korean government's move is far from what Washington expects. Sade → before the end of the agreement between Korea and China, the government synthesize the foreign and security sources say → stop North Korean provocations by China, the president of China and 2018 Winter Olympics.→ persuade the North's denuclearization talks reportedly pushing the idea that bokkwi. In fact, the president was Jens Stoltenberg, February NATO Secretary General Ban said in a meeting with Korean Peninsula following the 2018 Winter Olympics in February next year reducing tension and the two Koreas.Exchange and Cooperation, or of major opportunity to try to, explained. Despite the government's strong denial, some are even raising the possibility of the postponement of the Korea-U.S. joint military exercise along with the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. A diplomatic source in Seoul said, Of course, "" The recent U.S. is not even saying Korea is a swing state that goes back and forth between the U.S. and China, "" adding, "" Such an attitude is not likely to affect the future Korea-U.S. summit.

"Q : No one explains the accident, and the accident was reported to have caused the incident.A photo of the bereaved family of a 55-000 woman and a 23-year-old woman who died in the explosion and fire at the Changwon tunnel accident. However, they complained that they had not heard a single word from local officials or the police about the results or future measures until the deadline. The Bae family, who was recently transferred to work for the company after becoming full-time, is planning to hold candlelight vigils and demonstrations to demand thorough investigation and measures to prevent a recurrence. Bae called her mother in an urgent situation just before she died, adding to the confusion surrounding her husband. Bae's family said, After the accident, no one has ever explained what was going on in the investigation or what was going on, adding, We don`t even know what happened to the insurance company. Now that the drivers of the truck have died, it`s not the time to talk face-to-face with their bereaved families and discuss the situation, he added. The Yoo's family, who was found crying and lying down at the scene of the accident, also sent a letter to ask for help. Yoo reportedly suffered a bowel movement while visiting his daughter in Gimhae. The Yoo's family and Bae are considering taking legal action against the family of five ton-truckers. The family of Yoon, who carried the truck that caused the accident, reportedly returned to their home town of Ulsan after receiving the body from the National Scientific Investigation Institute. Regarding this, a police officer said, "" We are not concentrating on identifying the cause of the accident, such as the initial stages of investigation, and we are keeping an emergency contact with the bereaved family and the police are keeping an intervention period for the body. "" - 10:13 AM / by Josh LowensohnSite home1223@yna.co.kr and the tip of the report should be collected here (click!). According to the report ' Status of Korea Wireless Internet Industry 2016 ' by the Korea Wireless Internet Industry Association (MOBIA) on July 5, Google earned about 4.5 trillion won in revenue from the domestic app market. Korea`s app market in 2016 amounted to 7.6668 trillion won. Google Play relies on 58.2 percent of its revenue. Google provides developers with 70 percent of Google Play revenue and makes the other 30 percent profit. Last year's profits were estimated at 1.3397 trillion won. MOBIA expects Google Play to earn 5.3248 trillion won in revenue and 1.59 trillion won in profit this year. However, there is growing suspicion that Google is avoiding taxes by sending revenue generated from the country to the paper company that is set up in tax havens. In fact, Google's subsidiaries that distribute apps at Google Play besides its U.S. headquarters are Google Ireland Limited, Google Communications Limited and Google Asia Pacific Pte Limited, established in Singapore, both of which are tax havens. For Korean developers, the company is responsible for distributing apps to Singapore Corporation. The reason why Google is suspected of collecting more than trillions of won in revenue here but is not paying proper taxes is because its local subsidiary, Google Korea, has no obligation to disclose its revenue or taxes as a limited company. It is also difficult for the tax authorities to detect key services because they are controlled by overseas subsidiaries. In this context, Lee Hae-jin, head of Naver, recently appeared as a witness for the National Assembly`s National Policy Committee parliamentary audit and inspection, saying Google and Facebook make a huge amount of money. However, they do not pay taxes or hire anyone. We don`t pay for traffic, even pointing out the reverse discrimination problem with local companies. As the mood is reflected, many Korean companies are urging multinational corporations to collect taxpayers ` money. Professor of Seoul National University of Science and Technology Kim Hyun-kyung said, If we were to pay taxes, we would feel confident that tax evasions by overseas operators such as Google would seriously lower the morale of businesses and labor. Lee Sang-woo, president of the Media Management Association, said, There is no boundary between competition in the Internet market. We do not need to see domestic businesses provide global services, either. An environment should be created that would allow it to compete equally with overseas businesses here at least, said a public disclosure on sales and departure information from overseas businesses such as Google. However, Google Korea is against it. They do not disclose it to the general public, but they do so to the National Tax Service. "" The company's decision on how far to reveal its revenue is its decision, "" said an official with Google Korea, "" Google is paying taxes in Korea, and it is complying with local tax laws and treaties. "" After that, multinational companies ` tax problems are complicated, and it`s not something you can say you would like to pay a lot for. If you pay too much in Korea, you have to pay less in other countries. Then, other countries will protest why they only pay a lot of money to Korea. That is why they move according to tax treaties. Google Korea explains that it pays corporate tax on sales generated in Korea. However, Google App Store and others are controlled by Google's headquarters, so they don`t know about Google Korea. In fact, Google Korea`s chief negotiator John Lee recently appeared as a witness for the National Assembly audit, saying, We look at Google services locally, but not nationally. Shin Seong-ho, an adviser at the People's Party Committee who pointed out the tax problems of multinational companies during an overhaul of the National Assembly, said, "" It is important that what is sold out in our country is settled.

"In order to investigate the corruption allegations, a massive reshuffling of the ruling Saudi Arabian government's top officials is taking place in Seoul early next year, when the ruling party of the late Prince Muhammad Hammand-Frank and the New York Times began a major round of political maneuvering. At the same time, the only people who were previously fighting for the post were dismissed by the minister one after another, and the only ones who were already Saudi's top power were Prince Vin-Saliman, who sought to consolidate his control. According to Saudi state-run TV and media outlets in the Middle East, the Saudi royal family formed an anticorruption committee on July 4 (local time) and arrested 11 princes, four present ministers and dozens of ex-ministers. Among the arrested were al-Walid Bin Talal, the cousin of the late King Abdul Aziz and one of the richest men in the Arab world. He owns shares in global companies such as Fox, Apple and GM in the 21st century through Kingdom Holdings. The search for suspected anti-corrosion agents was carried out in a swift manner on the day that the Saudi royal family formed an anti-corruption committee. King Salman ordered an anti-corruption committee on the same day and appointed the Crown Prince as head of the House of Lords, to identify the role of corruption committed by `` vulnerable souls who seek public good. ''The Independent Commissioners Commission, comprised of heads of audit and security authorities, was granted a substantial authority. `` The Anti-Corruption Commission can decide not only to investigate but also to issue arrest warrants, ban on travel, financial dealings and freeze accounts, '' explained Arabic news, Saudi English newspaper. The Independent Commission Against Corruption has also been investigating incidents that occurred several years ago to investigate corruption cases committed by the royal family and officials. Al-Arabia, a private broadcasting station in the United Arab Emirates, announced Monday that it had arrested princes and former and former ministers, and that it had arrested the 2009 floods of tea and the Middle East respiratory tract issue of MERS.As high-ranking officials were involved in corruption cases, a massive reshuffle by incumbent ministers was also made. The Saudi royal family dismissed Miteb Vinch Dullah, who once struggled with Bin-Salman for the post of Crown Prince, from the National Defense Minister and appointed Kaled bin Ayaf. The economic minister was also replaced by former Middle Eastern chief executive officer Mohamed Altowazhri, who led a campaign to sell off government assets led by Crown Prince Bin Salman.The dozens of key figures were arrested and a massive turnover of key ministers in one day is interpreted as the move by Crown Prince Binjalman to establish full control over Saudi Arabia. Prince Vinsalman has pushed ahead with policies that have not welcomed vested interests, such as the privatization of national assets, the reduction of state subsidies and the permission of women to drive. The purge is aimed at those who oppose Binjalman's domestic reform policies and Qatar Dangyo's diplomatic lines. Only the Bin-Saal faction has established itself before the resignation of the late this year and early next year's king, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) said.Donald Trump, meanwhile, Saudi state oil company Aramco is president of America's New York listing binsal to attract only after pressing the Prince of Wales attracted attention. Trump, the president to leave her trip to Asia "" Saudi Aramco through Twitter, four days before the (ipo) initial public offering, Thank you very much to do with the New York Stock Exchange (nyse)., stressed. The Saudi government is preparing for the simultaneous listing of Aramco at home and abroad, and is weighing London and New York as the international listing sites. The WSJ analyzed that the fact that Saudi Arabia is leading Crown Prince Vinsalman on the list of state-owned oil companies Aramco contributed to the anti-corruption campaign.

The Hong Joon-pyo tonghapa Korea before the president was for a speedy settlement and integration of basic conditions for expulsion is the establishment meets the requirements, but strenuous efforts Korea is selling.Of course, being a party and seems to draw the line, seen from both sides of the people to bridge the gap between their difficult situation. Meanwhile, the former faction of Gyeonggi Province Governor Nam Kyung-pil appears to emphasize that the right party should unite to exercise its power, while coordinating opinions among the unity and strength of its members. The old faction has proposed a national unification convention and suggested that the right party should take the lead in consolidating its party into one stage, but they can not agree easily. Politicians believe that if the meeting is inconclusive, eight to 10 lawmakers, including Kim, will choose to leave for the Korea Party sometime next week. If the internal dispute is not resolved by the parliamentary committee, the right political party, which was founded on January 24, is expected to lose its status as a pully-handed floor negotiation group (20 seats) and become non-disciplined. If the right party turns into a non-contradiction group, it will not only be excluded from the negotiation process between the ruling and opposition parties, but will also significantly reduce the amount of state subsidy.

According to Ahn Byung-wook, he is a reporter.【 3’s death and 5 injuries were caused by explosion and fire in front of Changwon tunnel. A 76-year-old truck driver, identified as Yoon, did not fully fix the truck even though he was loaded with 196 barrels of fuel before it was driven. Police who searched a processing oil company in Ulsan, where Yoon loaded oil supplies, confirmed the incident by examining the company's CCTV. The Road Traffic Act requires all drivers to actually fix their luggage so it won't fall off, but they didn't. It was also discovered that five tons of trucks were loaded with 7.8 tons of fuel and Yoon had the same accident two years ago, but his carrier did nothing. There are many indications that the accident was typical of such men. Police have asked the head of the national police to investigate the exact cause of the accident, including whether the car was damaged or not, and whether Yoon was in good health. It will take about a week for the results of the national team analysis. This is Kim Byung-wook with MBN News.

However, not all of them denied the announcement that there was a large space inside the pyramid. Some say that they are dissatisfied with the fact that they were disclosed first by a foreign researcher without the government's approval or an announcement. Russian news agency Tass quoted an expert analysis saying "" Space in the pyramid may be a natural cause of construction design, "" and "" Additional research is needed to determine the real purpose of the space. "" Earlier today, the Scan Pyramid mission analyzed using the Muon Particles, confirming that a similar space was found on top of the previously known Great Pyramid walkway.

""" South Korean officials seem to have a lot of tricks, and North Korean officials seem to have literally turned into "" safe guards. "" This means that there are many civil servants in South Korea who are temperate in front of their superiors but still modest in the world, and those in North Korea are more short-tempered and unable to contain their anger. "" In North Korea, when officials are angry, they can't resist being poured out, and South Korean officials have avoided their anger, "" said A, who has served at the central ministry since 2012.B, who works for a local government agency as a grade 9 administrator, said, "" In North Korea, if you don't like it or not, don't want to talk about it.C, who works for a public institution, said, In North Korea, executives tend to be responsible for the mistakes of the people below them, and in South Korea, it is not as strong or as if they would be. "" To put it mildly, it would make the boundaries clear, but to the contrary, you have seen it too much, "" he said.Many of the government officials who work for North Korean defectors felt sorry for their country. Sometimes it sounds like a sarcasm for bosses to speak up while imitating North Korean accents, A said, frequently complaining about words they don`t use in the North. If the changes occur due to personnel changes, Korean officials can adjust to their new jobs in a week, which would take me more than a full month to adjust, B said.In North Korea, public servants are as popular as South Koreans. Although the concept of public officials is not clear due to the nature of the North Korean system that does not allow private property, it requires strict screening to work in the party, the Cabinet, the military and the people's security (police). Each ministry should look for necessary personnel, undergo background checks and a review of their ideology, pass written tests and the examination of the party`s committee.# Path to become a government employee … first, I say, "" If you work ninth at an economics department, "" and then you're working hard in South Korea to get away from home, you can say, ' If you're a government officer, you're a officer. "" After he fled the North, he received more than 10 licenses, including a certified public accountant, to become a civil servant.In North Korean society, government officials are seen as ' the powerful men who reign over the people. ' In particular, they used the term pan-producing, referring to jobs that can be called "" inferior "" - party, military, national security, security, and trade agencies. They see government officials as objects of fear, like tigers that dominate the beasts. It is also interpreted as a kind of biang that the government sends to those who boast with the power it confers on and show off all kinds of perks and humiliation.E, who escaped from North Korea while serving in the Department of National Security in 2007, said, "" So are the people in power who can arrest, detain, interrogate, or search without arrest warrants?

She only takes Sunday off a week and attends events and lectures on Saturdays to learn about her life. Vacation is prescribed at 14 days a year. If you marry someone or your immediate family, you can receive 7 to 21 more days.# Disciplinary punishment worse than punishment ... In North Korea, the punishment for political execution sentences includes caution, caution, stern warning, rigor, strictness, revolution, execution and justice. The least punishment is caution, warning. A stern warning will not alter the situation. The words "" rigor "" and "" iron "" mean dismissal, dismissal, or degradation. ' Revolutionary ' is not pre-party, and its periods vary from months to years.G, who works for a local government, said, "" Even though the sending party is disqualified as a member of the party due to the most severe punishment, it is like a political death sentence for the party, military, or Cabinet officials, "" and "" most likely it is because it is considered that it is a punishment by the committee.

"< Barcelona (Spain) = APNewsis > a man holds a scarf with Catalonia in Barcelona on October 27 (local time :). ▽ New Scientist and reporter Lee Soo-ji Seoul = Spain's northern state of Catalonia finally became frustrated. Karles PoujI, head of the local government, practically evacuated to Belgium and cabinet ministers were eventually detained. Prime Minister Mariano RahoI announced the central government's plan to directly govern Catalonia, with the constitution in Madrid's Article 155, on Oct. 27. The Catalonia Congress declared its independence on the same day, and the Spanish parliament responded with a parliamentary endorsement of Article 155 of the central government's constitution. The central government decided to fire Catalonia government officials on October 30 and hold an early local election on December 21. The Catalunya Independence Movement has a deep historical roots. But to sum up the economic reasons in a word, it is a complaint that "" a town in good shape will not pay for a town that is relatively poor. "" At a large rally in Catalonia, participants chanted, ' Madrid is robbing us. ' This means that the central government is taking more from Catalonia than the previous one (which the central government should pay unilaterally). North Catalunya residents with Barcelona account for 16 % of Spain's total population, whereas the local economy accounts for approximately one fifth of Spain's economy, worth 1.2 trillion dollars. Catalonia also pays $ 12 billion more in annual tax than Madrid. Catalonia is not the only continent to seek independence from the wealthy European region. One example is the northern Belgian plane, Flanders. Gross domestic product (GDP) is 120 % higher than the average per capita GDP of the European Union (EU). Bayern, southeast Germany, is also similar. The economy is ranked among the top 10 countries in the European Union. In Italy, Veneto, which includes Milano's state of Lombardia, Venice and Verona, voted on Oct. 22 to expand autonomy. Some wealthy European residents have long complained about the policies they have put in place to support poor local governments with their own taxes. This situation has become stronger as the global financial crisis swept Europe. It added fuel to the long-established nationalist sentiment. "" With globalization changing to what we call independence movement, "" said Andrés Ledriguess-Fosse, economics professor at the London School of Political Economy, in an American monthly magazine, Atlantic City on July 1. Yerin Jenn Gennes, professor of international relations at the University of Central Europe in Hungary, says economic inequality is the same thing that Redriguess-Fosse, a professor of economic geography, says of independence movements do not die down.As a result, regional economic inequality is strengthening European nationalism. Governor Luca Zaia of Benetto, northern Italy, held up his ballot at Treviso on July 22 (local time) to vote. When the issue of government subsidies to poor regions within a country becomes the motive for secessionalization, separate independence movements can take place around the world in the future. The results of the Italian Lombardia and Beneto states ' referendum are an example of how economic conflicts can turn into national identity problems. Paolo Grigordi, the local chief of the anti-immigrant, ultra-rightistery Northern Alliance, called for a referendum on what he called a ' call for increased financial power ' in Lombard state. In his referendum proposal, Rombardia was tired of providing 80 billion euros ($ 80 million) in national coffers each year, "" Rombardia had to separate from predatory Rome. "" However, talk of independence can make businesses and consumers nervous. Quebec, Canada is a prime example. As some political parties in Quebec tried to move out of the country, local businesses tried to relocate their headquarters, and property prices fell. Professor Redriguess-Posse told Atlantic that "" much of the trade in Catalonia is linked to the Spanish European Union, but if Catalonia is also able to remain independent all night, it is likely that Spain will lose nearly 20 % of its GDP overnight. "" He pointed out that Czechoslovakia was relatively well separated from the Czech Republic in 1993, but "" It took 10 years "" to revive its relatively fragile economy. If other regions are separated from each other, the economic recovery could take this long. It is best if it takes 10 years to revive the economy, he warned, If the conflict worsens during the separation process, it could take longer to recover and take one generation. suejeeq@newsis.com> (Tokyo : Yonhap News Agency) gimbyeonggyu Correspondent : Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, (安倍晋三) an American president has similar event of a state of war at summit six days.Egress countermeasure in Japanese, Americans living in South Korea plans to discuss the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun reported on July 5.

"" In addition, Saudi royal guard chief of the National Guard and top naval officers were replaced in a series of layoffs. The arrest and replacement of large numbers of people is either because Mohamed Binjalman (32), who received the post of Crown Prince from his cousin Salman (81) in June, is known to have attempted to step up his influence over or even because he is trying to expand his influence in September. Saudi Arabia's news Web site said that among those who were also known to have been caught were Prince Al-Walid Bin Talal. Prince Bin Talal is considered the richest man in the world, and is the cousin of King Salman. His Kingdom Holdings is said to have a significant stake in Disney and other global companies including Fox, Apple and GM in the 21st century. If it is true that Prince Bin Talal was arrested, the impact on the nation and abroad is likely to be significant. Saudi royal also replaced National Defense Minister Mithep Vinchuria, who once struggled with the Crown Prince for the post, as the chief executive of the Middle Eastern company, and the Economic Minister, Mohamed HSBC, who also led a sale of assets. As a result, it is noteworthy whether Binjalman's father's father's father's father's family system will make public any more. A source said, "" Saudi authorities prevented the takeoff of private jet jets in the Red Sea city of Jeddah to stop high-ranking officials from fleeing the country. "" Experts analyzed that the target audience is Binjalman's refusal to Qatar, along with opponents of national reform policies.
