"A jaundiced cleaner Park Joon-kyu, a readers of Kyunghyang Newspaper, said, Why greet the iron ingot, the train shell? It is not polite, kind, or humble. "" Kyunghyang's reader, Park Joon-kyu, recently posted a photo on Facebook. Because I saw an uncomfortable scene using SRT, a private high-speed train that runs the Gyeongbu and Honam lines. What made him uncomfortable was the waiting cleaning workers bowed as the train entered Suseo, the last stop.Those who say hello are the workers at the service company who arrange their rooms. All are middle-aged women workers. Normally when the train is eight cars long, eight people heat up at intervals. When the engine approaches 20 meters ahead, bend to greet. We keep saying hello until the train stops. "" So, I don't know what the scene is."" It is a kind of thing to greet a cleaning worker. "" However, when the locomotive passes by, it bends its back toward the moving car. It's an act of excess. It appears to be pressuring the worker's ego. By forcing kindness and humility, it actually results in a person's compliance with discrimination, "" Park said. His words and pictures, which he said were "" offended rather than over-hearted, "" were spread and similar opinions were expressed.They're just putting the facade of "" customer kindness, "" and they're forcing us to think like, "" I don't think you're forcing the managers to do that. "" "" I don't see why aren't employers forcing you to clean up? "" Some complained of an angry "" no one's on people "" protest, and others wrote on the real company's website.SRT, a securities company that operates SRT, said cleaning workers ' greetings were contained in a contract with the contractors. Trend newspaper reader Park Joon-kyu also received a complaint saying, "" Why don't you say hello? "" SR, the stock company that runs SRT, was aware of this issue. SR officials said, "" When the train comes in, the cleaning people say hello, "" but they say, "" I don't greet the train, I don't want to greet the customers ; I welcome them. """" In the past, similar protests have caused cleaning workers to stop greeting them for a month or two, "" said SR. So why did the problem begin again? Why don't you say hello to them? Because there were more complaints. She said, "" At first, I don't want to advertise myself as being so polite and now I don't, "" adding, "" Why haven't you changed already? "" As a result, she began to greet people to collect public opinion.■ As a result of company interviews that were proposed as a ' differentiated service ', the HR issues of cleaning workers were not merely a question of customer reaction. Personnel was one of the official duties stated in the contract with the room service provider.Entering the railway market exclusively owned by Korail in December 2016, SRT stressed ' differentiated service ' from the beginning to secure competitiveness. In an SR based external contest, a company proposed a "" clean and orderly cleaning service, "" which was adopted and eventually made a bid.The company says cleaning workers, called car maintenance workers, wear clean uniforms and complete the train cleaning in 15 minutes using professional cleaning equipment. Cleaners who arrive on the train have also included a "" task range "" of contracts. It is a ‘ premium service ’, for which SR pays higher than usual for the services it provides.SR is ready to review the issue from the ground up."" Aborting cleaning workers ' greetings unilaterally is technically a breach of contract, "" said an SR official, "" but many customers have reviewed the issue as much.< Incheon Youngjong-do journalist Kim Hyung-kyu fidelio@kyunghyang.com> [Twitter] ▶ The [Popular free cartoons] p.p.com A day before the opening of the airport's second edition of the newspaper (www.khan.co.kr),, passengers who visited the terminal looked up front (July 13-15) and read the paper beforehand … The second terminal, which will begin operation on July 18, was first introduced to the public on July 13 with the launch of the airport's railway and KTX services. Kim Ki-hun, reporter of Yeongjong-do (Yonhap news agency Youngjong=Korea) 2018.1.14 : "" Gosh, you missed Terminal 1. I thought I could get off at the last stop ... "" Going to China by Asiana Airlines, he had to go to the existing terminal, but he went to the wrong terminal. Waiting for the train to Terminal 1 at the platform, he kept on nervously carrying his cell phone. When the second terminal of Incheon International Airport opens on July 18, passengers using four airlines - Korean Air, Delta, Air France and KLM - must go to terminal 2. For other passengers, Asiana Airlines and other airlines can use the terminal as it is. Although terminal 2 has not officially opened yet, several cases of misdirection are being reported when the airport railway is connected to terminal 2 from July 13 and one visits the terminal incorrectly. Some airport bus routes have begun operating until the second terminal since July 15, and the second terminal is scheduled to be officially operated on July 18, leading to an increase in passengers who will be delivered to the airport. Before the opening, passengers who arrived at Incheon International Airport were able to arrive at Terminal 2. A Mongol couple who had to take the Asiana Airlines flight to Tashkent, saw that they had come to the wrong terminal when they arrived at the departure area on the third floor of the terminal, and returned to the terminal with the help of a guide. Foreign passengers who return to Terminal 1 were also sometimes seen on the platforms of the No. 2 terminal of the airport railway. Incheon International Airport Corporation (Incheon International Airport) placed guide personnel at terminal 2 and calculated the number of passengers who received information on arrival was 227-15. As the second terminal was opened to the public, an average of 75 people visited the terminal each day. On average, about 80 passengers a day mistake the first terminal and the top flight, explained a construction official. The corporation predicted that when the second terminal is opened, approximately 700 passengers will be left arriving each day to mistake the terminal. Airport railways have shown more frequent misdirection than expected, a construction official said, explaining, We will reinforce announcements on the airport railways and deploy personnel on the platforms so that passengers can immediately return to terminal 1. It also plans to prepare transportation prevention measures such as distributing the first and second terminal information messages at tollgates, and deploy the information centers and departure areas with a focus on those who can be reached. Among passengers on arrival, the arrival card will be allocated on arrival. With this card, you can check in at the check-in counter first. If you have mistaken the terminal, you can take the shuttle bus to and from the terminal 1 and 2. The shuttle buses run every five minutes, and it takes about 15 minutes from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2, while it takes about 18 minutes from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1. Using an airport railway, it takes approximately 6 minutes to return from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1. However, it should be considered that the interval between the trains at the airport is approximately 12 minutes. kihun@yna.co.kr"
"LGU+200-200 will not be able to change 25 % discount due to cancellation charges. If LGU + is allowed to switch without penalty from 15th, it will pay 5 % more per month by SKT and KT subscribers, therefore, it will not be able to reduce the price by 25 %. It is also pointed out that it is a case of treating subscribers as "" peaks "" and of showing the lack of competition for price reduction in the mobile communication market. LG U-Plus is allowed to transfer to the 25 percent discount rate without incurring a penalty, regardless of the amount of time remaining in its contract, starting July 15. Previously, it was only possible to move on without penalty when the remaining contract period was less than six months. You can request a re-appointment of the alternative medicine by visiting the agency or calling the customer center (114 without an exchange number). But SK Telecom and Katie still have to make the change without penalty only when the remaining contracts are under six months. Both operators simply say "" let the department concerned review it "" on the request of < Hankyoreh > and do not specify when. According to the Ministry of Science and Technology and Information, the number of mobile phone subscribers who opted for a discount instead of the handset support amounted to 18.18 million as of last December. Among them, only 56.6 million people receive a 25 percent discount. The Moon Jae-in president chose one of the communication service fee cut promise of contract discount fare discount rate by 25 percent four months have passed, but the approximately 1,300 million.Still receiving charges by 20 % discount. If mobile industry officials tell you that the maximum discount that the three mobile operators can get is estimated to be 200 billion won per month when they can transfer to the discount rate of 25 percent regardless of the remaining period. Among them, 100 billion won is for SK Telecom, 60 billion won for Katie and 40 billion won for LG U +. As a result, SK Telecom and Katie would not give their customers any benefits to save 160 billion won. Their "" guts "" is blamed on analyzing that it is unlikely that they would have many subscribers who would otherwise have to leave without giving benefits. Industry watchers say the combined products of wired, wireless, broadcasting and telecom have already secured subscribers and they need to pay a penalty to cancel, even though they don`t need to comply with LG U-Plus. Some analyze that the mobile market has become too stiff to face a price cut competition. The Ministry of Science and Technology and Information said, "" Whenever a demand for lower mobile service charges is made, the price should be decreased by competition between operators rather than by artificial lowering of prices. "" However, it ended up being a nonsense. Kim Jae-seop, journalist at Hangyeoryeong jskim@hani.co.kr [Subscription to Man and Animals] [KakaoTalk] [Industrial Hangyeong Newspaper : Doebulsoo Doubulsoo's Office of Mission.Daebulmun Party Counder Moon Seung-koo's brother-in-law Kim was asked to take part in a job payment package deal with the former U.S. Senator Kim Seung-soo. Moon was suspected of asking Korean Air to hire Kim, but was acquitted. Mr. Kim is 'Moon Hee-sang, brother-in-law and Korean Air, a job request of the case will reveal the truth.' in the title of the position, and these claims. Calling himself the younger brother of Moon`s wife Kim Yang-soo, he said, I was part of what was called the controversial "" Moon Shan-moon case in 2015, "" during which he asked for a job at Korean Air. `` The evidence was clear, '' he said. `` Of course I expected Moon to be punished. '' Although it was recognized that Moon asked Korean Air Chairman Cho Yang-ho for a job at the first trial, the prosecution did not even indict him for reasons that were not convincing, he said. Chairman Cho and Congressman Moon are alumni of Kyungbok High School. Regarding the incident, Kim Yang-soo could ask creditors to give over her ownership of the building because she could not make a collateral payment on the one she owned, said Rep. Moon. Korean Air then proposed to work instead of offering. I worked as a consultant at a related company in 2004 and received a total of 747,000 dollars (about 800 million won) in salary until 2012. Moon and Cho claimed their aides had been sneaking around when they were discovered, but Moon was definitely aware of my job, Kim said. `` I have never worked for the company. I don`t know what the consultant is doing. It is not just a case of job seeking, he said, Moon`s story is about extorting money from big businesses to write off his debts. As to the reasons for the belated disclosure, Moon is said to be running for National Assembly Speaker, but such a person should not be the speaker, Kim said. The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors ` Office announced in 2016 that it cleared Moon of any charges against accepting work as a brother-in-law last year. Moon's involvement in the scandal was not disclosed, the source said. The revelation came when Moon's wife and brother-in-law Kim filed a suit over a mortgage loan in 2015. Moon told The JoongAng Ilbo on the phone, All the charges were cleared in the first, second and third trial. I have never asked such a favor. Family disputes have arisen over whether to give property to the family because of the prosecute`s wealth problem, he said, filing a lawsuit against parties who spread false information. Scmp the Chinese Academy of Sciences, according to the Global Environment Research Center is from (Xi'an) city of Xian, Shaanxi (陝西) the city of months ago from a height of China around air cleaner by running a pilot more than a 100 mOf 12 cheukjjeongso to measure air quality improvement in. As a result, the average concentration of PM 2.5 (ultrafine dust less than 2.5 ㎛ in diameter) was reduced by 15 % on the day of serious air pollution. The effect of improving air quality was found to be around 10 square kilometers, with the air purifier producing 10 million clean air per day after its operation. When dirty air is drawn into a glass greenhouse half the size of a soccer field at the bottom of the air freshener, it becomes hot and sunny. At this time, the air is clean during the process of passing through several layers of filters. "" The air purifier is the largest in the world and the effects of air quality improvement are very encouraging, "" said Chao Ji-jin, a senior researcher at the project. "" Because of its use of solar power, little power is needed. "" Last year, the 7-meter-high air purifier created 8 ㎥ of clean air per second in Beijing, but it was mostly operated by electricity generated from thermal power plants and was not very helpful in environmental improvement.▽ A bird's eye view of the 100 m air purifier in Shian City, China 〓 As many households heat coal during the capture of the South China Morning Post (SCMP) in Hong Kong, residents of Shian City were satisfied with the air purifier effects. One student at ShaanxI Normal University, several hundred meters from the air purifier, said, "" The air purifier is so quiet that it can not be heard coming and going, "" and "" There is no room for improvement. "" A 1km away restaurant manager also said he could feel the air cleaner this winter. However, the report said that it is hard for people who live far away from the air purifier to recognize it. Another disadvantage is that the coating materials of the glass greenhouse located in the air purifier can absorb solar radiation and the air purifier only works in winter. The team plans to more precisely measure and release overall air quality improvements in the air purifier in March. Furthermore, it hopes to build an air purifier that is 500 meters high and 200 meters in diameter to clean the air in areas within 30 square kilometers. It is the scale to improve the air quality of small cities as a whole. ssahn@yna.co.kr"

"" We are also considering the real effectiveness of raising property tax + comprehensive real estate tax, although we can say it is because of the high demand for speculative apartments in the Gangnam area. Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Kim Dong-yeon appeared on the radio show ` Kim's News Plant ` on the morning of July 16 and said, It is the first time for Kim to appear on national radio since he took office in June last year. Kim asked about 40 minutes of questions on the disputes over virtual currency, property holding taxes, minimum wage and dozen dozen dozen. ◇ "" I do not want to raise any controversy over virtual currency.Considering the fact that it is not uncommon for the money market to be affected by the losses, it is hard to say that the issue of voice transactions due to the close of the exchange is not easy to refute, Kim said (collectively). I will do it as soon as possible, he added. Regarding the government's position, Kim said, "" We should separate the economic and economic aspects from the speculative aspects of virtual currencies and the losses of good will in investment, "" adding, "" We should consider the regulatory measures separately. "" Vice Prime Minister Kim said, It is important to bear in mind that the government failed to give a consistent message. I feel sorry for not giving a consistent and clear message in that regard. Justice Minister Park Sang-kee earlier announced his decision to close the exchange, but Cheong Wa Dae concluded that it was not a final decision. The Office for Government Policy Coordination said on Monday that it plans to deal with such issues as coordinating the stance of ministries on virtual currencies with the government.◇ As it makes sense to raise property taxes, Minister Kim said, Regarding property taxes, the increase is lower than other countries `, even when it comes to property taxes. Regarding the reason for the rise in housing prices in southern Seoul, he pointed out that speculative demand is the biggest factor.However, Kim said, If we raise property taxes, which are property taxes, and comprehensive real estate taxes, it will cover the whole region, as it is aimed at analyzing the effects of real estate prices since there are other areas that are overheated, including Gangnam 4.Regarding the view that officials living in Gangnam are in favor of raising house prices, Kim said, "" When I read a comment, I don't like the fact that it is a good idea to raise house prices in Gangnam, "" adding, adding, "" I am indifferent to it. "" According to the disclosure of the assets of public officials, Kim's wife owns a Dogok Rexle apartment (59.98 ㎡, 18-pyeong) worth 588 million won (based on the actual purchase price) in Dogok-dong, Gangnam-gu. ◇ What do you care most about? Minimum wage? ’’ Kim said, "" The most structural problem in our society is polarization. "" Security guards, regardless of the number of employees, provide job security, he said. The wage of the lowest increased by 16.4 percent (647-7530 won per hour), the highest in 17 years. As the minimum wage increases put pressure on small and mid-sized employers, the government has decided to provide employers with labor support. The government is planning to enforce a budget of 2.97 trillion won (130,000 won) this year through the Korea Workers ’ Compensation and Welfare Service. The total number of applicants is estimated at 3 million. ◇ Measurement “a dozen actual possessor, the prosecution will say” silsoyu controversy has come of the former president of Lee Myung-bak Kim in debates over ‘imprisonment has inheritance tax payment’ of the DAS company dating back to company stock.For “Regulation is wrong and change the government.” said.

However, due to the non-listed stock characteristics, the value calculation was vague, which resulted in a greater loss of the national treasury than real estate and stock. The ministry decided to revise the enforcement ordinance to pay taxes to real estate owners even if they have collateral secured. When asked about the en masse relocation of the dozen, the prosecution said it was inappropriate to comment on the issue here, with tax investigations even underway, prosecutors said.

"As I visited the indoor animal park last year, I found that a series of early morning doors for animals including wild beasts and visitors were not covered with cement or light lighting, and the front of the doors were not lit up by the stress of the examination. Choi Ye-rin, a semi-monthly breast bear, scratched the glass wall in a room larger than three pyeong. The carbula lives in a zoo in Daejeon. Decorated with an aquarium on the first floor and an indoor experience zoo on the second and third floors, Daejeon Zoo has a maengsu pavilion where tigers, lions, jaguars, lynx, and hyenas live. The game beasts are kept in glass rooms with a size of 3 to 5 pyeong and a size of 8 to 14 pyeong, respectively, to greet visitors. In these cold weather, indoor experience zoos are popular. This is because visitors can easily see many animals simultaneously, regardless of the season. Is an indoor zoo good for the spectator good for the animals? I visited the zoo three times in August, September, and December last year. On September 25 last year, Kabul was in a small room with no lights on, and with a bear. Even in the afternoon of August 13, Kabul was confined to a small room by himself. The floor of the zoo animals is made of cement and the front wall is a common glass. There is no place where animals stay outdoors. There is no distinction between where the animals are resting and watched. Whenever a spectator came, the carbula was breathing hard, sticking to a food hole under the glass wall. Scratches were scratched with claws and teeth and moved around the small spaces. 2. The two bear groups, both in their three trips to the zoo, demonstrated this type of formal behavior (an animal's unnatural behavior and extreme stress). There is a big room next to the small room, but the big cats live in the small room from late afternoon when the zookeepers start cleaning up. Last August, the zoo was locked in a small room about three pyeong in size, and moved back and forth between the walls constantly. The same applies to tigers and lions larger than the anti-monthly bear Choi Ye-rin. A tiger (2) sleeps in a glass room of approximately 4 pyeong, a lion (2) and a lynx (2) and a black jaguar (2) sleeps in a glass room of 2.7 pyeong. The lion slopped over the chicken given to him by the zookeepers, while the tiger moved between the glass walls in a formal manner. Even when he was in a large room around 13 pyeong during the day, the tiger kept coming and going across the animal history. Every beast has a feeding hole in its feed pipe under the glass wall. Visitors purchase food, such as chicken legs, from the zoo that are placed on sharp steel skewers and push it into a food hole. The hole was wide enough to hold the child's fist. Parents usually buy their children beef skewers and push them into a food hole. Many animals of the menstroke were fixed to the food hole when approached, and they would move quickly in front of the glass wall if they would not scratch the mouth and teeth to feed them. Zookeepers at the zoo go home from work at 5 or 6 p.m. At 6:40 p.m. on September 25, the lights in the beast temple went out altogether. When the fluorescent light went out, the animal history turned dark. Until the closing time for visitors (7 p.m. weekdays and 8 p.m. weekends), each member of the zoo staff stays on duty and no one cares for animals until morning. There are no vets that reside at the zoo. Tiger in Daejeon Zoo on September 25, 2006. Two tigers, male and female, sit inside a four-pyeong zoo keeper. Choi Ye-rin, a reporter at the zoo, was locked in a 4.5-pyeong animal temple under bright fluorescent light on September 25 last year, and did not move in a loose manner. Choi Ye-rin, a reporter at the zoo, showed a "" black jaguar's look "" on September 25 last year, and he moved around the glass room. Choi Ye-rin, reporter of the zoo, announced on September 25 last year that two lynx, both male and female, also stay in a small room from late in the afternoon until the morning of the following day. Choi Ye-rin, a reporter at the zoo, evacuated the zoo in November 2016, when he was 11 months old. The escape was presumed to have occurred through a metal rail under the roof during the wee hours of the morning when no one was in the zoo. Kabul was caught on a hiking trail on Bomunsan Mountain, Daejeon, 300 meters from the zoo. After that happened, the personality of the thief changed. A zoo keeper said, Until there was an escape, the Buddha was rather gentle. Now people are acting fiercely to scratch glass walls and see if there are any scars left on their minds when caught. Even then, no one is on duty at the zoo until the next morning after watching the movie. Only the CCTV works. There is an outside veterinarian, but we can come and see animals when they have special problems. A female lion, Remi, from the Pyeongtaek Zoo in Gyeonggi Province, also lives in a 3-pyeong indoor area. Remi, 17, was born at a different zoo in Korea and moved to the zoo. Remi's room has a ganglike opening in one side. The other wall is connected to the feeding room and the other is the cement wall. The floor was tiled for bathrooms, with only one wooden bed 1.5 meters wide and 2 meters long. There is a small cage on the wall. Japanese monkeys, ponies, pigs, big dogs and guinea pigs were displayed at the outdoor animal temple near the entrance to the zoo, but the animals lacked a shade shield to avoid the scorching sun. Other than Remi, the first two levels of interior space included skunk, coatI, and meerkat. CoatI was imprisoned by a cage keeper of more than 80cm and moved around incessantly to behave formally. CoatI is a Naughty animal and lives in South America a lot. On September 13 last year, a 16-year-old lioness sits in her cage at Pyeongtaek zoo in Gyeonggi Province. Indoor experience zoos that exhibit wild animals like Kabul or Remi, a reporter for Shinsoyun, are located in Daejeon, Pyeongtaek, Gimhae and Daegu. In particular, indoor experience zoos are growing all over the country recently, allowing visitors to touch and feed relatively small animals such as coatI, raccoon, rabbit and meerkat. Visitors like it because you can look around the room regardless of the season, and see various animals in a small space and in a short time. For operators, it is easy to make money with a small investment by bringing non-secretary endangered animals indoors at a low cost. As there is no specific policy on the conditions of animal history other than the current law, establishment and operation of indoor experience zoos is not complicated. Experts say that the area code is far below the minimum standards for healthy animals. According to the Interior Zoo Research Report released last February by the Society for the Prevention of Animals, small breeding areas are the main cause of chronic stress for animals. Visitors can also feed, eat, eat, eat, and vomit while starving. Larger mammals, especially lions, tigers, black jaguars, lynx, hyena, and half moon bears, need outdoor keepers, but no indoor zoo with such outdoor spaces. Animals are also frightened when they are under fluorescent light and turn dark suddenly after watching it. Animals who live in areas with no hiding place and the whole place are exposed to the eyes of visitors, and are under a lot of stress. Jeon Chae Eun, the director of Action for Animals, said, "" Other animals need a large zoo keeper, but especially big wild animals in the bear and cat department need to use natural light in a fairly large area. Keeping these animals requires that you keep an outdoor gallery with natural light and indoor spaces for rest at night. However, there is no specific rule concerning the conditions of breeding wild animals in Korea except for the area. We need to improve the system to determine the conditions of the zoos ' breeding conditions much more specifically, ranging from large mammals to small animals, he said. As for animal care at an indoor animal park, Jeon also commented, It makes no sense that neither the zoo nor the shelter is equipped with professional residents, such as zookeepers and veterinarians. Since wild animals can not tell their health by the look of their pets, veterinarians have to check their health status constantly and make a note of it. The indoor experience zoo, which is famous for its poor breeding environment and poor animal care, can not make a contract with a vet at an outdoor animal hospital. We need to make it fast to have full-time vets as well.

"The virtual currency market (cipher currency) and the KOSDAQ index are on the opposite path. While the tech-heavy KOSDAQ Index has soared to more than 900 in about 16 years, the virtual currency market seems to have plunged under government pressure, including the closing of the Korea Exchange. ◇ KOSDAQ Index closed at 901.23, up 9.62 points (1.08 %) from the previous day, according to the Korea Exchange. It has been more than 15 years and 10 months since March 29, 2002 (927.30) when the closing price was exceeded 900. The KOSDAQ, which broke through the 890 mark the previous day, continued its upward trend thanks to the dual buying of foreigners and organizations on the same day. The agency led the market by purchasing 71.8 billion won worth of shares and foreigners 45.1 billion won worth of shares. The reason for the KOSDAQ's quickly breaking through the 900 mark is the Seltrion Brothers (Celtrion, Celtrion Pharmaceutical and Celtrion Health Care). The KOSDAQ closed at 891.61 as of July 15, but the index is so strong that it is only 700, excluding the Celtrions. This compares with the rise of the KOSPI due to the dominance of the market capitalization of Samsung Electronics last year, and is also cited as the weakness of the market itself. However, due to the effects of the government's policies, the analysis shows that the KOSDAQ closed its long recession and entered the winning phase is prevalent. In particular, it is widely believed that the movement of the organizations has been brisk since the Financial Services Commission announced last week that it would boost the Kosdaq's competitiveness. Kim Byung-yeon, economist at NH Investment & Securities, said, The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KRX 300), the venture and KOSDAQ exclusive income deductions, and the creation of a 300 billion won KOSDAQ fund were all designed to boost the fundamental health market. If the gap between institutions and foreigners continues in the future, the KOSDAQ will surpass the 1,000 mark, which is also a matter of time, experts say. ◇ Virtual currency threatens to shut down the exchange while the virtual currency market has plummeted every time a senior official spoke since the government imposed regulations to curb speculative demand this year. Justice Minister Park Sang-kee recently told a news conference, "" The exchange is to be closed. "" Following the controversy surrounding the fact, Economy Minister and Strategy and Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon was also quoted as emphasizing the radio plant's closing. The government is set to make the market transparent through its strategy of fighting speculation and developing block-chain technologies, but critics say it fails to give a consistent message to the market.Since then, the price of virtual currency has plummeted. According to the Bitcone, the coin fell more than 8 percent as of 4:30 p.m. to settle at 17.6 million won. Considering that the price of the products was around 25 million won per line on July 7, the tendency has been sharply decreased. Major virtual currencies such as Ripple and Discourse also showed a decline of 10 percent, and they are discouraged.The government will also collect the policy funds invested in the virtual currency exchange. The small and medium venture ministry said, "" If illegal acts are discovered through an investigation on the virtual currency exchange, we will recover funds from the fund. "" The fund is usually executed by private venture capital, and if the capital is cut off, the virtual currency market is forecast to shrink. Some say that the government will stop the inflow of new virtual currency into the market with drives to boost the KOSDAQ market.""

""The Russian English media The Siberian Times reported the news of Omiyakon, a village in the Yakutian Republic.Known as the "" coldest town in the world "" among human populations, Omiyakon is a basin in Siberia, about 300km from the North Pole and is home to hundreds of Saha people who migrate from nearby Lake Baikal.What is surprising is the extreme weather. The temperature goes down to minus 50 degrees Celsius this time of year, but it's a warm day for local people. It's called the coldest town in the world, and Omiyakon recorded a record of minus 677 degrees in 1933.

"[Drug Report : Dodoli Table : The Possession of Despair & Repent Contributions.] Return to prison at the age of one and only "" Back to prison. "" A journalist by the handKwon and her daughter, NaemI, were arrested during the winter of 2005 in Hankookilbo.com, a reporter at the hospital in Sinsa-dong, Seoul. I heard that it is called Pyeongtaek Police Station in Gyeonggi-do. ' Ha ... Again.He put another needle in his forearm's vein. It has been months since she was released from the Chung-ju Women's Hospital for the use of meth. When the boy who was caught playing with me first referred to it, police called him and found out that his daughter had positive reaction in her urine.After hearing of the confusion, he worked as usual at a furniture factory in Incheon. The press has cut off one of the thumb parts of his right hand. It was stitched but shortened by 1cm. It was no big deal. How can it compare to the pain of seeing her daughter desperately after losing her entire 20s? My poor daughter trapped inside the increasingly ruinous revolving door of a drug addict! This year 81-year-old Kwon Yoo-woo is trying to let the world know her daughter's lost decade in father's eyes. My daughter was devastated by her first orange drug syringe when she was 20. The world is a criminal, but the patient I watched with her never stopped. I want to talk about it.After hell broke loose at a moment, her daughter touched on drugs for the first time in 1998 when she graduated from an appeal. The IMF crisis shut the doors of the school's graduates to the bank. She was deeply distressed at her simple job of earning 600,000 won a month. The relationship between mother and daughter has also turned sour. The daughter, who was out of her own house in Busan, put up a meth lab with a strange man she met while chatting. It was a time of falling into the abyss. I've divorced my wife, so I have no choice. Two years passed like that. The child's daughter, who had been on medication for a long time, was caught by police for being late to report to her mother who was living together again. The mother suspected her daughter, who was often coming home in the early morning, had suddenly lost weight. She dug through her daughter's closet and handed over a diary and a syringe filled with stories of medication she found. When you get addicted to meth, you lose your appetite.The daughter was first caught by an investigating agency and was given a stay of indictment under treatment. It was a kind of leniency that did not leave her to trial for a certain period of time. But her daughter took another dose. He was handed over to trial the following year and given a suspended jail sentence of one year. The stay of execution was no warning for the daughter who was already on medication. Before receiving any probation, she was put on medication again and ended up in jail for a year and a half.In 2001, the first daughter in her suit and jail term met an acquaintance in her cell. My daughter came to Seoul from Busan after she was released from prison the following year. My daughter said she would probably continue to take medicines in Busan. I grew up in a remote part of the house, had a lot of trouble with the mother so I tried not to provoke my daughter. I felt sorry for my daughter because she felt as if she had a criminal label on her inside her. He was suspected of being a social outcast. He only said one word when he went to work every day. "" Please relax, "" the Korean daily paper photo showed a lethargic daughter visited the home of her elder sister since 2004, when she was living together in Bongcheon-dong, Seoul. Here we go, that would have been close. I was going to put a monkey on my arm. Al-A, who owns a stay-at-home mom, a sex trade agency, lived in Namyangju City, Gyeonggi Province, where she was completely immersed in medicine. Neither the fellow man nor three or four of the crowd. I fully surmised that it was a problematic house. I was in agony. "" Should I leash my daughter like a dog?' I couldn't help it. ' Yeah, you can go, but just come back.People can see me as a lunatic. However, the situation is different when there are female drug addicts in the home. There is nothing more disturbing than lying and going anywhere. It was all the more incredible to walk around making a pretense of "" Just a Friend's House. "" Some people around her daughter were also drug addicts. My daughter or they had never "" cut the mustard "" when they came out of jail after all that. I was less anxious to go to my sister who I knew. Was there any vague expectation that they would do anything worse or let them die? After all, my daughter was useless to me when I stopped her strongly. I was going to run out as hard. They could not hold themselves back while they were making money at factories. My generation learned not to cry in public, but they were alone when they shed tears. There was no other way. I spent such a long time worrying. It was that hard. I'm sorry to my daughter, but I felt most at home when she was in Cheongju or Mokpo. At least the thought of an accident being safe. The next thing I feel comfortable with is being in the hospital. I could usually sleep when my daughter went there. To be honest, it was like she went into a temple with a haircut. If I could come back in the manservant, I wouldn't have asked for more.There was a stuffy dilemma in deep conflict. It was a matter of paying for her daughter's drug. She then took out a loan from a third bank and received meth. My daughter wrote my name in the paper protection column and called me whenever she was left behind. Whenever that happened, I would go mad. I decided to repay it after thinking a lot. I was afraid that a miracle would occur and my daughter would stop taking medicines, but she was frustrated with it again and might come up with medicines. I paid back 7 million won from 2003 to 2005. It was when I made one to 1.2 million won per month by doing factory work.Even now, the nightmare of Kwon's daughter who has been addicted to drugs for more than 10 years is confusing. I was really in high spirits. My daughter screamed with excitement in the car, "" Dad's dead. "" I was not well next to him and he kept shouting and shouting that I was killed by demons. Al-ye was bringing her daughter home from an acute addiction when she was given medication at her sister's house. "" I think I'll jump out of the kid's rooftop, take him home and put him to sleep, "" one older sister said. I saw my daughter in person and felt real. ' You hit the bottom of your life.I have taken away all of the sharp things in the house for fear of accidents. Even though it's rare, some drug addicts have hallucinations.My son who had my sister hospitalized reported to the police, "" I will die in a ditch if I do. "" Until then, my daughter had never poured "" merchant marine "" into a drug. You need to protect it so I can get a refill. My son was not willing to take revenge but to save his brother, who was also restless. Their daughter, who used to take medicines from them, was also summoned by the prosecution. She connected men who first gave her daughter crystal meth for free but later sold it. Though he is like a foe, he is thankful to have warned his daughter before she died.The daughter, who was put on trial again in 2007 for the work of her older sister, put a needle in her pocket again the day before the sentence was passed. It was given with a man who was four years older. There was a smack of medicine. Asked my daughter. "" Did you touch the meth again? "" "" Do you have anything else left? "" "" Okay. "" "" Give me this, "" I sprinkled the medicine you had given my daughter on the toilet and lowered it. I made a remark as I went to work. "" Turn yourself in, "" the daughter admitted her mistake. I got down on my knees and reported it to 112 by myself. She turned herself in and went to Ansan Hospital after having a seizure in jail. Back then, only the man who gave medicine was punished.I couldn't get out of the nightmare. The daughter reached for the medicine afterwards. In 2008, a telephone called "" Take Your daughter with You "" from the police box. The daughter was so drunk that she repeatedly told the taxi driver to "" go away as I want to, "" and then dropped the driver off at the police box in amazement. Police have released what they saw as ' crazy woman '. I couldn't stand it anymore and warned him last. "" Do not leave the hospital until you stop taking medicines. "" Eventually, the daughter went to Bugok National Hospital, where she was on regular medication protection. I could not get rid of all my hopes, but I thought it would be impossible for my daughter to escape from the addiction revolving door.I lived out of the way until recently. He was the father of a daughter who was on drugs. I have kept my mouth shut, not being able to speak well to my relatives anywhere in the world. The brand was like a shadow. His left ear was deaf, and he was grateful for it. I was overwhelmed by the business cards given by the Korean daily newspaper. That is why I have said this with difficulty, slagging my beloved daughter for the first time in nearly two decades. The disease anyone can get is drug addiction. There are a lot of people who are really struggling. Hopefully, drug addicts can give us a chance to live like a human being.Sohn Hyun-seong, reporter of Hankookilbo.com, said, "" At an interview on November 18, we did not disclose drug addiction or dependence on Korean society as a criminal and we need to recover and repair it as an informed consent form. Let's talk about the dramatic revival of the characters of Kwon and her daughters at the end of the series (8th inning).The story of the 100 people interviewed by the reporter, who stayed for 15 days with the exposer, is close and far from being treated.

It is estimated that the number of sexual crimes (暗 罪) not recognised by the investigating agencies or not caught in official statistics is 20 to 30 times higher. The advanced drug distribution methods such as virtual currency and online transactions may have been one of the main reasons, but it has long passed the point where they can be regarded as a departure from organized crime, entertainment businesses, and overseas students. Now, showing them up instead of turning a blind eye to them can be a shortcut to understanding the reality and finding solutions. Hankook Ilbo reporters spent 15 days watching the world from their point of view while staying with drug takers.

Most of the local exchanges showed signs of relief, welcoming the government's direction.However, it is predicted that the government will consider the issue as an open card even though it will not immediately use such a strong policy as shutting down the exchange.If the remarks are opened to the public, the deputy prime minister pointed out various problems that occur when shutting down the exchange as a counterargument, and made a premise that inter-ministerial coordination should take precedence. This in itself is no different from the existing stance.Still, the deputy prime minister, who has insisted on a balanced control over tough measures, first referred to it as a living option, as a subtle nuances from the past.We do not see the remarks by the deputy prime minister as much different from the government`s previous stance, an industry official said, but we are just trying to freeze the market before we enter the new dealer market this month.If the real-name transaction system is adopted later this month, the influx of new subscribers will begin again. The government is worried that the virtual currency market will fluctuate once more.In addition, the analysis shows that if stronger deterrent measures are needed while the transaction real-name system is being adopted and taxed, the market is being given a signal so that the central bank can make a bold decision on the ' close up ' card.The government has always controlled the market through this kind of verbal intervention, an industry official said. up@newsis.com ▶ New Sis Big Data MSI Stock List-Light to the Circulate…Newspaper's Facebook [Twitter] < consensus media news agency, unauthorized reproduction - Redistribution is prohibited.>"
"A jaundiced cleaner Park Joon-kyu, a readers of Kyunghyang Newspaper, said, Why greet the iron ingot, the train shell? It is not polite, kind, or humble. "" Kyunghyang's reader, Park Joon-kyu, recently posted a photo on Facebook. Because I saw an uncomfortable scene using SRT, a private high-speed train that runs the Gyeongbu and Honam lines. What made him uncomfortable was the waiting cleaning workers bowed as the train entered Suseo, the last stop.Those who say hello are the workers at the service company who arrange their rooms. All are middle-aged women workers. Normally when the train is eight cars long, eight people heat up at intervals. When the engine approaches 20 meters ahead, bend to greet. We keep saying hello until the train stops. "" So, I don't know what the scene is."" It is a kind of thing to greet a cleaning worker. "" However, when the locomotive passes by, it bends its back toward the moving car. It's an act of excess. It appears to be pressuring the worker's ego. By forcing kindness and humility, it actually results in a person's compliance with discrimination, "" Park said. His words and pictures, which he said were "" offended rather than over-hearted, "" were spread and similar opinions were expressed.They're just putting the facade of "" customer kindness, "" and they're forcing us to think like, "" I don't think you're forcing the managers to do that. "" "" I don't see why aren't employers forcing you to clean up? "" Some complained of an angry "" no one's on people "" protest, and others wrote on the real company's website.SRT, a securities company that operates SRT, said cleaning workers ' greetings were contained in a contract with the contractors. Trend newspaper reader Park Joon-kyu also received a complaint saying, "" Why don't you say hello? "" SR, the stock company that runs SRT, was aware of this issue. SR officials said, "" When the train comes in, the cleaning people say hello, "" but they say, "" I don't greet the train, I don't want to greet the customers ; I welcome them. """" In the past, similar protests have caused cleaning workers to stop greeting them for a month or two, "" said SR. So why did the problem begin again? Why don't you say hello to them? Because there were more complaints. She said, "" At first, I don't want to advertise myself as being so polite and now I don't, "" adding, "" Why haven't you changed already? "" As a result, she began to greet people to collect public opinion.■ As a result of company interviews that were proposed as a ' differentiated service ', the HR issues of cleaning workers were not merely a question of customer reaction. Personnel was one of the official duties stated in the contract with the room service provider.Entering the railway market exclusively owned by Korail in December 2016, SRT stressed ' differentiated service ' from the beginning to secure competitiveness. In an SR based external contest, a company proposed a "" clean and orderly cleaning service, "" which was adopted and eventually made a bid.The company says cleaning workers, called car maintenance workers, wear clean uniforms and complete the train cleaning in 15 minutes using professional cleaning equipment. Cleaners who arrive on the train have also included a "" task range "" of contracts. It is a ‘ premium service ’, for which SR pays higher than usual for the services it provides.SR is ready to review the issue from the ground up."" Aborting cleaning workers ' greetings unilaterally is technically a breach of contract, "" said an SR official, "" but many customers have reviewed the issue as much.< Incheon Youngjong-do journalist Kim Hyung-kyu fidelio@kyunghyang.com> [Twitter] ▶ The [Popular free cartoons] p.p.com A day before the opening of the airport's second edition of the newspaper (www.khan.co.kr),, passengers who visited the terminal looked up front (July 13-15) and read the paper beforehand … The second terminal, which will begin operation on July 18, was first introduced to the public on July 13 with the launch of the airport's railway and KTX services. Kim Ki-hun, reporter of Yeongjong-do (Yonhap news agency Youngjong=Korea) 2018.1.14 : "" Gosh, you missed Terminal 1. I thought I could get off at the last stop ...

Waiting for the train to Terminal 1 at the platform, he kept on nervously carrying his cell phone. When the second terminal of Incheon International Airport opens on July 18, passengers using four airlines - Korean Air, Delta, Air France and KLM - must go to terminal 2. For other passengers, Asiana Airlines and other airlines can use the terminal as it is. Although terminal 2 has not officially opened yet, several cases of misdirection are being reported when the airport railway is connected to terminal 2 from July 13 and one visits the terminal incorrectly. Some airport bus routes have begun operating until the second terminal since July 15, and the second terminal is scheduled to be officially operated on July 18, leading to an increase in passengers who will be delivered to the airport. Before the opening, passengers who arrived at Incheon International Airport were able to arrive at Terminal 2. A Mongol couple who had to take the Asiana Airlines flight to Tashkent, saw that they had come to the wrong terminal when they arrived at the departure area on the third floor of the terminal, and returned to the terminal with the help of a guide. Foreign passengers who return to Terminal 1 were also sometimes seen on the platforms of the No. 2 terminal of the airport railway. Incheon International Airport Corporation (Incheon International Airport) placed guide personnel at terminal 2 and calculated the number of passengers who received information on arrival was 227-15. As the second terminal was opened to the public, an average of 75 people visited the terminal each day. On average, about 80 passengers a day mistake the first terminal and the top flight, explained a construction official. The corporation predicted that when the second terminal is opened, approximately 700 passengers will be left arriving each day to mistake the terminal. Airport railways have shown more frequent misdirection than expected, a construction official said, explaining, We will reinforce announcements on the airport railways and deploy personnel on the platforms so that passengers can immediately return to terminal 1. It also plans to prepare transportation prevention measures such as distributing the first and second terminal information messages at tollgates, and deploy the information centers and departure areas with a focus on those who can be reached. Among passengers on arrival, the arrival card will be allocated on arrival. With this card, you can check in at the check-in counter first. If you have mistaken the terminal, you can take the shuttle bus to and from the terminal 1 and 2. The shuttle buses run every five minutes, and it takes about 15 minutes from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2, while it takes about 18 minutes from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1. Using an airport railway, it takes approximately 6 minutes to return from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1. However, it should be considered that the interval between the trains at the airport is approximately 12 minutes. kihun@yna.co.kr"

If LGU + is allowed to switch without penalty from 15th, it will pay 5 % more per month by SKT and KT subscribers, therefore, it will not be able to reduce the price by 25 %. It is also pointed out that it is a case of treating subscribers as "" peaks "" and of showing the lack of competition for price reduction in the mobile communication market. LG U-Plus is allowed to transfer to the 25 percent discount rate without incurring a penalty, regardless of the amount of time remaining in its contract, starting July 15. Previously, it was only possible to move on without penalty when the remaining contract period was less than six months. You can request a re-appointment of the alternative medicine by visiting the agency or calling the customer center (114 without an exchange number). But SK Telecom and Katie still have to make the change without penalty only when the remaining contracts are under six months. Both operators simply say "" let the department concerned review it "" on the request of < Hankyoreh > and do not specify when. According to the Ministry of Science and Technology and Information, the number of mobile phone subscribers who opted for a discount instead of the handset support amounted to 18.18 million as of last December. Among them, only 56.6 million people receive a 25 percent discount.

Among them, 100 billion won is for SK Telecom, 60 billion won for Katie and 40 billion won for LG U +. As a result, SK Telecom and Katie would not give their customers any benefits to save 160 billion won. Their "" guts "" is blamed on analyzing that it is unlikely that they would have many subscribers who would otherwise have to leave without giving benefits. Industry watchers say the combined products of wired, wireless, broadcasting and telecom have already secured subscribers and they need to pay a penalty to cancel, even though they don`t need to comply with LG U-Plus. Some analyze that the mobile market has become too stiff to face a price cut competition. The Ministry of Science and Technology and Information said, "" Whenever a demand for lower mobile service charges is made, the price should be decreased by competition between operators rather than by artificial lowering of prices.

Moon was suspected of asking Korean Air to hire Kim, but was acquitted. Mr. Kim is 'Moon Hee-sang, brother-in-law and Korean Air, a job request of the case will reveal the truth.' in the title of the position, and these claims. Calling himself the younger brother of Moon`s wife Kim Yang-soo, he said, I was part of what was called the controversial "" Moon Shan-moon case in 2015, "" during which he asked for a job at Korean Air. `` The evidence was clear, '' he said. `` Of course I expected Moon to be punished. '' Although it was recognized that Moon asked Korean Air Chairman Cho Yang-ho for a job at the first trial, the prosecution did not even indict him for reasons that were not convincing, he said. Chairman Cho and Congressman Moon are alumni of Kyungbok High School. Regarding the incident, Kim Yang-soo could ask creditors to give over her ownership of the building because she could not make a collateral payment on the one she owned, said Rep. Moon. Korean Air then proposed to work instead of offering. I worked as a consultant at a related company in 2004 and received a total of 747,000 dollars (about 800 million won) in salary until 2012. Moon and Cho claimed their aides had been sneaking around when they were discovered, but Moon was definitely aware of my job, Kim said. `` I have never worked for the company. I don`t know what the consultant is doing. It is not just a case of job seeking, he said, Moon`s story is about extorting money from big businesses to write off his debts. As to the reasons for the belated disclosure, Moon is said to be running for National Assembly Speaker, but such a person should not be the speaker, Kim said. The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors ` Office announced in 2016 that it cleared Moon of any charges against accepting work as a brother-in-law last year. Moon's involvement in the scandal was not disclosed, the source said. The revelation came when Moon's wife and brother-in-law Kim filed a suit over a mortgage loan in 2015. Moon told The JoongAng Ilbo on the phone, All the charges were cleared in the first, second and third trial. I have never asked such a favor. Family disputes have arisen over whether to give property to the family because of the prosecute`s wealth problem, he said, filing a lawsuit against parties who spread false information. Scmp the Chinese Academy of Sciences, according to the Global Environment Research Center is from (Xi'an) city of Xian, Shaanxi (陝西) the city of months ago from a height of China around air cleaner by running a pilot more than a 100 mOf 12 cheukjjeongso to measure air quality improvement in. As a result, the average concentration of PM 2.5 (ultrafine dust less than 2.5 ㎛ in diameter) was reduced by 15 % on the day of serious air pollution. The effect of improving air quality was found to be around 10 square kilometers, with the air purifier producing 10 million clean air per day after its operation. When dirty air is drawn into a glass greenhouse half the size of a soccer field at the bottom of the air freshener, it becomes hot and sunny. At this time, the air is clean during the process of passing through several layers of filters. "" The air purifier is the largest in the world and the effects of air quality improvement are very encouraging, "" said Chao Ji-jin, a senior researcher at the project. "" Because of its use of solar power, little power is needed. "" Last year, the 7-meter-high air purifier created 8 ㎥ of clean air per second in Beijing, but it was mostly operated by electricity generated from thermal power plants and was not very helpful in environmental improvement.▽ A bird's eye view of the 100 m air purifier in Shian City, China 〓 As many households heat coal during the capture of the South China Morning Post (SCMP) in Hong Kong, residents of Shian City were satisfied with the air purifier effects. One student at ShaanxI Normal University, several hundred meters from the air purifier, said, "" The air purifier is so quiet that it can not be heard coming and going, "" and "" There is no room for improvement. "" A 1km away restaurant manager also said he could feel the air cleaner this winter. However, the report said that it is hard for people who live far away from the air purifier to recognize it. Another disadvantage is that the coating materials of the glass greenhouse located in the air purifier can absorb solar radiation and the air purifier only works in winter. The team plans to more precisely measure and release overall air quality improvements in the air purifier in March. Furthermore, it hopes to build an air purifier that is 500 meters high and 200 meters in diameter to clean the air in areas within 30 square kilometers. It is the scale to improve the air quality of small cities as a whole. ssahn@yna.co.kr"
"- appearing on the radio program "" Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Economy Kim Il-jun's News Plant "" - "" Minister of Finance and Economy Lee Hyung-cheol's closing down, serious review "" - "" We need to analyze real estate pricing effects and fear of minimum wage layoffs. "" We are also considering the real effectiveness of raising property tax + comprehensive real estate tax, although we can say it is because of the high demand for speculative apartments in the Gangnam area. Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Kim Dong-yeon appeared on the radio show ` Kim's News Plant ` on the morning of July 16 and said, It is the first time for Kim to appear on national radio since he took office in June last year. Kim asked about 40 minutes of questions on the disputes over virtual currency, property holding taxes, minimum wage and dozen dozen dozen. ◇ "" I do not want to raise any controversy over virtual currency.Considering the fact that it is not uncommon for the money market to be affected by the losses, it is hard to say that the issue of voice transactions due to the close of the exchange is not easy to refute, Kim said (collectively). I will do it as soon as possible, he added. Regarding the government's position, Kim said, "" We should separate the economic and economic aspects from the speculative aspects of virtual currencies and the losses of good will in investment, "" adding, "" We should consider the regulatory measures separately. "" Vice Prime Minister Kim said, It is important to bear in mind that the government failed to give a consistent message. I feel sorry for not giving a consistent and clear message in that regard. Justice Minister Park Sang-kee earlier announced his decision to close the exchange, but Cheong Wa Dae concluded that it was not a final decision. The Office for Government Policy Coordination said on Monday that it plans to deal with such issues as coordinating the stance of ministries on virtual currencies with the government.◇ As it makes sense to raise property taxes, Minister Kim said, Regarding property taxes, the increase is lower than other countries `, even when it comes to property taxes. Regarding the reason for the rise in housing prices in southern Seoul, he pointed out that speculative demand is the biggest factor.However, Kim said, If we raise property taxes, which are property taxes, and comprehensive real estate taxes, it will cover the whole region, as it is aimed at analyzing the effects of real estate prices since there are other areas that are overheated, including Gangnam 4.Regarding the view that officials living in Gangnam are in favor of raising house prices, Kim said, "" When I read a comment, I don't like the fact that it is a good idea to raise house prices in Gangnam, "" adding, adding, "" I am indifferent to it. "" According to the disclosure of the assets of public officials, Kim's wife owns a Dogok Rexle apartment (59.98 ㎡, 18-pyeong) worth 588 million won (based on the actual purchase price) in Dogok-dong, Gangnam-gu. ◇ What do you care most about? Minimum wage? ’’ Kim said, "" The most structural problem in our society is polarization. "" Security guards, regardless of the number of employees, provide job security, he said. The wage of the lowest increased by 16.4 percent (647-7530 won per hour), the highest in 17 years. As the minimum wage increases put pressure on small and mid-sized employers, the government has decided to provide employers with labor support. The government is planning to enforce a budget of 2.97 trillion won (130,000 won) this year through the Korea Workers ’ Compensation and Welfare Service. The total number of applicants is estimated at 3 million. ◇ Measurement “a dozen actual possessor, the prosecution will say” silsoyu controversy has come of the former president of Lee Myung-bak Kim in debates over ‘imprisonment has inheritance tax payment’ of the DAS company dating back to company stock.For “Regulation is wrong and change the government.” said. "" I don't think so, "" the ministry said, responding to the question, "" but there were regulatory errors. "" Park Young-sun deobul According to the former president's brother-in-law Kim Jae-jeong had bought a share fishermen died when his wife, Mr. gwonyeongmi a dozen inheritance tax become an owner of the 416 million won payment. Kwon owned a large estate but paid it off with unlisted shares. Under the current national property law, it is impossible to pay water if the land has an collateral security. However, due to the non-listed stock characteristics, the value calculation was vague, which resulted in a greater loss of the national treasury than real estate and stock. The ministry decided to revise the enforcement ordinance to pay taxes to real estate owners even if they have collateral secured. When asked about the en masse relocation of the dozen, the prosecution said it was inappropriate to comment on the issue here, with tax investigations even underway, prosecutors said. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance Kim Dong-yeon thanked the resident representative for visiting Gajwa 2-dong, Incheon, where he decided to keep the employment of security guards despite the minimum wage increase.

"As I visited the indoor animal park last year, I found that a series of early morning doors for animals including wild beasts and visitors were not covered with cement or light lighting, and the front of the doors were not lit up by the stress of the examination. Choi Ye-rin, a semi-monthly breast bear, scratched the glass wall in a room larger than three pyeong. The carbula lives in a zoo in Daejeon. Decorated with an aquarium on the first floor and an indoor experience zoo on the second and third floors, Daejeon Zoo has a maengsu pavilion where tigers, lions, jaguars, lynx, and hyenas live. The game beasts are kept in glass rooms with a size of 3 to 5 pyeong and a size of 8 to 14 pyeong, respectively, to greet visitors. In these cold weather, indoor experience zoos are popular. This is because visitors can easily see many animals simultaneously, regardless of the season. Is an indoor zoo good for the spectator good for the animals? I visited the zoo three times in August, September, and December last year. On September 25 last year, Kabul was in a small room with no lights on, and with a bear. Even in the afternoon of August 13, Kabul was confined to a small room by himself. The floor of the zoo animals is made of cement and the front wall is a common glass. There is no place where animals stay outdoors. There is no distinction between where the animals are resting and watched. Whenever a spectator came, the carbula was breathing hard, sticking to a food hole under the glass wall. Scratches were scratched with claws and teeth and moved around the small spaces. 2. The two bear groups, both in their three trips to the zoo, demonstrated this type of formal behavior (an animal's unnatural behavior and extreme stress). There is a big room next to the small room, but the big cats live in the small room from late afternoon when the zookeepers start cleaning up. Last August, the zoo was locked in a small room about three pyeong in size, and moved back and forth between the walls constantly. The same applies to tigers and lions larger than the anti-monthly bear Choi Ye-rin. A tiger (2) sleeps in a glass room of approximately 4 pyeong, a lion (2) and a lynx (2) and a black jaguar (2) sleeps in a glass room of 2.7 pyeong. The lion slopped over the chicken given to him by the zookeepers, while the tiger moved between the glass walls in a formal manner. Even when he was in a large room around 13 pyeong during the day, the tiger kept coming and going across the animal history. Every beast has a feeding hole in its feed pipe under the glass wall. Visitors purchase food, such as chicken legs, from the zoo that are placed on sharp steel skewers and push it into a food hole. The hole was wide enough to hold the child's fist. Parents usually buy their children beef skewers and push them into a food hole. Many animals of the menstroke were fixed to the food hole when approached, and they would move quickly in front of the glass wall if they would not scratch the mouth and teeth to feed them. Zookeepers at the zoo go home from work at 5 or 6 p.m. At 6:40 p.m. on September 25, the lights in the beast temple went out altogether. When the fluorescent light went out, the animal history turned dark. Until the closing time for visitors (7 p.m. weekdays and 8 p.m. weekends), each member of the zoo staff stays on duty and no one cares for animals until morning. There are no vets that reside at the zoo. Tiger in Daejeon Zoo on September 25, 2006. Two tigers, male and female, sit inside a four-pyeong zoo keeper. Choi Ye-rin, a reporter at the zoo, was locked in a 4.5-pyeong animal temple under bright fluorescent light on September 25 last year, and did not move in a loose manner. Choi Ye-rin, a reporter at the zoo, showed a "" black jaguar's look "" on September 25 last year, and he moved around the glass room. Choi Ye-rin, reporter of the zoo, announced on September 25 last year that two lynx, both male and female, also stay in a small room from late in the afternoon until the morning of the following day. Choi Ye-rin, a reporter at the zoo, evacuated the zoo in November 2016, when he was 11 months old. The escape was presumed to have occurred through a metal rail under the roof during the wee hours of the morning when no one was in the zoo. Kabul was caught on a hiking trail on Bomunsan Mountain, Daejeon, 300 meters from the zoo. After that happened, the personality of the thief changed. A zoo keeper said, Until there was an escape, the Buddha was rather gentle. Now people are acting fiercely to scratch glass walls and see if there are any scars left on their minds when caught. Even then, no one is on duty at the zoo until the next morning after watching the movie. Only the CCTV works. There is an outside veterinarian, but we can come and see animals when they have special problems. A female lion, Remi, from the Pyeongtaek Zoo in Gyeonggi Province, also lives in a 3-pyeong indoor area. Remi, 17, was born at a different zoo in Korea and moved to the zoo. Remi's room has a ganglike opening in one side. The other wall is connected to the feeding room and the other is the cement wall. The floor was tiled for bathrooms, with only one wooden bed 1.5 meters wide and 2 meters long. There is a small cage on the wall. Japanese monkeys, ponies, pigs, big dogs and guinea pigs were displayed at the outdoor animal temple near the entrance to the zoo, but the animals lacked a shade shield to avoid the scorching sun. Other than Remi, the first two levels of interior space included skunk, coatI, and meerkat. CoatI was imprisoned by a cage keeper of more than 80cm and moved around incessantly to behave formally. CoatI is a Naughty animal and lives in South America a lot. On September 13 last year, a 16-year-old lioness sits in her cage at Pyeongtaek zoo in Gyeonggi Province. Indoor experience zoos that exhibit wild animals like Kabul or Remi, a reporter for Shinsoyun, are located in Daejeon, Pyeongtaek, Gimhae and Daegu. In particular, indoor experience zoos are growing all over the country recently, allowing visitors to touch and feed relatively small animals such as coatI, raccoon, rabbit and meerkat. Visitors like it because you can look around the room regardless of the season, and see various animals in a small space and in a short time. For operators, it is easy to make money with a small investment by bringing non-secretary endangered animals indoors at a low cost. As there is no specific policy on the conditions of animal history other than the current law, establishment and operation of indoor experience zoos is not complicated. Experts say that the area code is far below the minimum standards for healthy animals. According to the Interior Zoo Research Report released last February by the Society for the Prevention of Animals, small breeding areas are the main cause of chronic stress for animals. Visitors can also feed, eat, eat, eat, and vomit while starving. Larger mammals, especially lions, tigers, black jaguars, lynx, hyena, and half moon bears, need outdoor keepers, but no indoor zoo with such outdoor spaces. Animals are also frightened when they are under fluorescent light and turn dark suddenly after watching it. Animals who live in areas with no hiding place and the whole place are exposed to the eyes of visitors, and are under a lot of stress. Jeon Chae Eun, the director of Action for Animals, said, "" Other animals need a large zoo keeper, but especially big wild animals in the bear and cat department need to use natural light in a fairly large area. Keeping these animals requires that you keep an outdoor gallery with natural light and indoor spaces for rest at night. However, there is no specific rule concerning the conditions of breeding wild animals in Korea except for the area. We need to improve the system to determine the conditions of the zoos ' breeding conditions much more specifically, ranging from large mammals to small animals, he said. As for animal care at an indoor animal park, Jeon also commented, It makes no sense that neither the zoo nor the shelter is equipped with professional residents, such as zookeepers and veterinarians. Since wild animals can not tell their health by the look of their pets, veterinarians have to check their health status constantly and make a note of it. The indoor experience zoo, which is famous for its poor breeding environment and poor animal care, can not make a contract with a vet at an outdoor animal hospital. We need to make it fast to have full-time vets as well.

"The virtual currency market (cipher currency) and the KOSDAQ index are on the opposite path. While the tech-heavy KOSDAQ Index has soared to more than 900 in about 16 years, the virtual currency market seems to have plunged under government pressure, including the closing of the Korea Exchange. ◇ KOSDAQ Index closed at 901.23, up 9.62 points (1.08 %) from the previous day, according to the Korea Exchange. It has been more than 15 years and 10 months since March 29, 2002 (927.30) when the closing price was exceeded 900. The KOSDAQ, which broke through the 890 mark the previous day, continued its upward trend thanks to the dual buying of foreigners and organizations on the same day. The agency led the market by purchasing 71.8 billion won worth of shares and foreigners 45.1 billion won worth of shares. The reason for the KOSDAQ's quickly breaking through the 900 mark is the Seltrion Brothers (Celtrion, Celtrion Pharmaceutical and Celtrion Health Care). The KOSDAQ closed at 891.61 as of July 15, but the index is so strong that it is only 700, excluding the Celtrions. This compares with the rise of the KOSPI due to the dominance of the market capitalization of Samsung Electronics last year, and is also cited as the weakness of the market itself. However, due to the effects of the government's policies, the analysis shows that the KOSDAQ closed its long recession and entered the winning phase is prevalent. In particular, it is widely believed that the movement of the organizations has been brisk since the Financial Services Commission announced last week that it would boost the Kosdaq's competitiveness. Kim Byung-yeon, economist at NH Investment & Securities, said, The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KRX 300), the venture and KOSDAQ exclusive income deductions, and the creation of a 300 billion won KOSDAQ fund were all designed to boost the fundamental health market. If the gap between institutions and foreigners continues in the future, the KOSDAQ will surpass the 1,000 mark, which is also a matter of time, experts say. ◇ Virtual currency threatens to shut down the exchange while the virtual currency market has plummeted every time a senior official spoke since the government imposed regulations to curb speculative demand this year. Justice Minister Park Sang-kee recently told a news conference, "" The exchange is to be closed. "" Following the controversy surrounding the fact, Economy Minister and Strategy and Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon was also quoted as emphasizing the radio plant's closing. The government is set to make the market transparent through its strategy of fighting speculation and developing block-chain technologies, but critics say it fails to give a consistent message to the market.Since then, the price of virtual currency has plummeted. According to the Bitcone, the coin fell more than 8 percent as of 4:30 p.m. to settle at 17.6 million won. Considering that the price of the products was around 25 million won per line on July 7, the tendency has been sharply decreased. Major virtual currencies such as Ripple and Discourse also showed a decline of 10 percent, and they are discouraged.The government will also collect the policy funds invested in the virtual currency exchange. The small and medium venture ministry said, "" If illegal acts are discovered through an investigation on the virtual currency exchange, we will recover funds from the fund. "" The fund is usually executed by private venture capital, and if the capital is cut off, the virtual currency market is forecast to shrink. Some say that the government will stop the inflow of new virtual currency into the market with drives to boost the KOSDAQ market.""

"[Drug Report : Dodoli Table : The Possession of Despair & Repent Contributions.] Return to prison at the age of one and only "" Back to prison. "" A journalist by the handKwon and her daughter, NaemI, were arrested during the winter of 2005 in Hankookilbo.com, a reporter at the hospital in Sinsa-dong, Seoul. I heard that it is called Pyeongtaek Police Station in Gyeonggi-do. ' Ha ... Again.He put another needle in his forearm's vein. It has been months since she was released from the Chung-ju Women's Hospital for the use of meth. When the boy who was caught playing with me first referred to it, police called him and found out that his daughter had positive reaction in her urine.After hearing of the confusion, he worked as usual at a furniture factory in Incheon. The press has cut off one of the thumb parts of his right hand. It was stitched but shortened by 1cm. It was no big deal. How can it compare to the pain of seeing her daughter desperately after losing her entire 20s? My poor daughter trapped inside the increasingly ruinous revolving door of a drug addict! This year 81-year-old Kwon Yoo-woo is trying to let the world know her daughter's lost decade in father's eyes. My daughter was devastated by her first orange drug syringe when she was 20. The world is a criminal, but the patient I watched with her never stopped. I want to talk about it.After hell broke loose at a moment, her daughter touched on drugs for the first time in 1998 when she graduated from an appeal. The IMF crisis shut the doors of the school's graduates to the bank. She was deeply distressed at her simple job of earning 600,000 won a month. The relationship between mother and daughter has also turned sour. The daughter, who was out of her own house in Busan, put up a meth lab with a strange man she met while chatting. It was a time of falling into the abyss. I've divorced my wife, so I have no choice. Two years passed like that. The child's daughter, who had been on medication for a long time, was caught by police for being late to report to her mother who was living together again. The mother suspected her daughter, who was often coming home in the early morning, had suddenly lost weight. She dug through her daughter's closet and handed over a diary and a syringe filled with stories of medication she found. When you get addicted to meth, you lose your appetite.The daughter was first caught by an investigating agency and was given a stay of indictment under treatment. It was a kind of leniency that did not leave her to trial for a certain period of time. But her daughter took another dose. He was handed over to trial the following year and given a suspended jail sentence of one year. The stay of execution was no warning for the daughter who was already on medication. Before receiving any probation, she was put on medication again and ended up in jail for a year and a half.In 2001, the first daughter in her suit and jail term met an acquaintance in her cell. My daughter came to Seoul from Busan after she was released from prison the following year. My daughter said she would probably continue to take medicines in Busan. I grew up in a remote part of the house, had a lot of trouble with the mother so I tried not to provoke my daughter. I felt sorry for my daughter because she felt as if she had a criminal label on her inside her. He was suspected of being a social outcast. He only said one word when he went to work every day. "" Please relax, "" the Korean daily paper photo showed a lethargic daughter visited the home of her elder sister since 2004, when she was living together in Bongcheon-dong, Seoul. Here we go, that would have been close. I was going to put a monkey on my arm. Al-A, who owns a stay-at-home mom, a sex trade agency, lived in Namyangju City, Gyeonggi Province, where she was completely immersed in medicine. Neither the fellow man nor three or four of the crowd. I fully surmised that it was a problematic house. I was in agony. "" Should I leash my daughter like a dog?' I couldn't help it. ' Yeah, you can go, but just come back.People can see me as a lunatic. However, the situation is different when there are female drug addicts in the home. There is nothing more disturbing than lying and going anywhere. It was all the more incredible to walk around making a pretense of "" Just a Friend's House. "" Some people around her daughter were also drug addicts. My daughter or they had never "" cut the mustard "" when they came out of jail after all that. I was less anxious to go to my sister who I knew. Was there any vague expectation that they would do anything worse or let them die? After all, my daughter was useless to me when I stopped her strongly. I was going to run out as hard. They could not hold themselves back while they were making money at factories. My generation learned not to cry in public, but they were alone when they shed tears. There was no other way. I spent such a long time worrying. It was that hard. I'm sorry to my daughter, but I felt most at home when she was in Cheongju or Mokpo. At least the thought of an accident being safe. The next thing I feel comfortable with is being in the hospital. I could usually sleep when my daughter went there. To be honest, it was like she went into a temple with a haircut. If I could come back in the manservant, I wouldn't have asked for more.There was a stuffy dilemma in deep conflict. It was a matter of paying for her daughter's drug. She then took out a loan from a third bank and received meth. My daughter wrote my name in the paper protection column and called me whenever she was left behind. Whenever that happened, I would go mad. I decided to repay it after thinking a lot. I was afraid that a miracle would occur and my daughter would stop taking medicines, but she was frustrated with it again and might come up with medicines. I paid back 7 million won from 2003 to 2005. It was when I made one to 1.2 million won per month by doing factory work.Even now, the nightmare of Kwon's daughter who has been addicted to drugs for more than 10 years is confusing. I was really in high spirits. My daughter screamed with excitement in the car, "" Dad's dead. "" I was not well next to him and he kept shouting and shouting that I was killed by demons. Al-ye was bringing her daughter home from an acute addiction when she was given medication at her sister's house. "" I think I'll jump out of the kid's rooftop, take him home and put him to sleep, "" one older sister said. I saw my daughter in person and felt real. ' You hit the bottom of your life.I have taken away all of the sharp things in the house for fear of accidents. Even though it's rare, some drug addicts have hallucinations.My son who had my sister hospitalized reported to the police, "" I will die in a ditch if I do. "" Until then, my daughter had never poured "" merchant marine "" into a drug. You need to protect it so I can get a refill. My son was not willing to take revenge but to save his brother, who was also restless. Their daughter, who used to take medicines from them, was also summoned by the prosecution. She connected men who first gave her daughter crystal meth for free but later sold it. Though he is like a foe, he is thankful to have warned his daughter before she died.The daughter, who was put on trial again in 2007 for the work of her older sister, put a needle in her pocket again the day before the sentence was passed. It was given with a man who was four years older. There was a smack of medicine. Asked my daughter. "" Did you touch the meth again? "" "" Do you have anything else left? "" "" Okay. "" "" Give me this, "" I sprinkled the medicine you had given my daughter on the toilet and lowered it. I made a remark as I went to work. "" Turn yourself in, "" the daughter admitted her mistake. I got down on my knees and reported it to 112 by myself. She turned herself in and went to Ansan Hospital after having a seizure in jail. Back then, only the man who gave medicine was punished.I couldn't get out of the nightmare. The daughter reached for the medicine afterwards. In 2008, a telephone called "" Take Your daughter with You "" from the police box. The daughter was so drunk that she repeatedly told the taxi driver to "" go away as I want to, "" and then dropped the driver off at the police box in amazement. Police have released what they saw as ' crazy woman '. I couldn't stand it anymore and warned him last. "" Do not leave the hospital until you stop taking medicines. "" Eventually, the daughter went to Bugok National Hospital, where she was on regular medication protection. I could not get rid of all my hopes, but I thought it would be impossible for my daughter to escape from the addiction revolving door.I lived out of the way until recently. He was the father of a daughter who was on drugs. I have kept my mouth shut, not being able to speak well to my relatives anywhere in the world. The brand was like a shadow. His left ear was deaf, and he was grateful for it. I was overwhelmed by the business cards given by the Korean daily newspaper. That is why I have said this with difficulty, slagging my beloved daughter for the first time in nearly two decades. The disease anyone can get is drug addiction.

Drugs have spread rapidly and have already reached a dangerous level that threatens the health of our society. In 2016, the total number of offenders was 14,214, up 20 percent from a year earlier. It is estimated that the number of sexual crimes (暗 罪) not recognised by the investigating agencies or not caught in official statistics is 20 to 30 times higher. The advanced drug distribution methods such as virtual currency and online transactions may have been one of the main reasons, but it has long passed the point where they can be regarded as a departure from organized crime, entertainment businesses, and overseas students. Now, showing them up instead of turning a blind eye to them can be a shortcut to understanding the reality and finding solutions. Hankook Ilbo reporters spent 15 days watching the world from their point of view while staying with drug takers.

Most of the local exchanges showed signs of relief, welcoming the government's direction.However, it is predicted that the government will consider the issue as an open card even though it will not immediately use such a strong policy as shutting down the exchange.If the remarks are opened to the public, the deputy prime minister pointed out various problems that occur when shutting down the exchange as a counterargument, and made a premise that inter-ministerial coordination should take precedence. This in itself is no different from the existing stance.Still, the deputy prime minister, who has insisted on a balanced control over tough measures, first referred to it as a living option, as a subtle nuances from the past.We do not see the remarks by the deputy prime minister as much different from the government`s previous stance, an industry official said, but we are just trying to freeze the market before we enter the new dealer market this month.If the real-name transaction system is adopted later this month, the influx of new subscribers will begin again. The government is worried that the virtual currency market will fluctuate once more.In addition, the analysis shows that if stronger deterrent measures are needed while the transaction real-name system is being adopted and taxed, the market is being given a signal so that the central bank can make a bold decision on the ' close up ' card.The government has always controlled the market through this kind of verbal intervention, an industry official said. up@newsis.com ▶ New Sis Big Data MSI Stock List-Light to the Circulate…Newspaper's Facebook [Twitter] < consensus media news agency, unauthorized reproduction - Redistribution is prohibited.>"

No matter how strict the management of the suppliers is, Chinese companies can not completely detect poor sanitary conditions and fake food. In particular, the health problems of the main food, pork, were the most serious. Wal-Mart, along with IBM America, recently found a basic solution to the problem. It provides a real-time, real-time view into the environment where the ingredients are produced, and then into the store. This is made possible by introducing a new method of storing data called block chains to the entire production and distribution.◇ Block chain Wal-Mart, which leads the financial, logistics, medical, and content revolution, has installed IoT sensors throughout the transportation route, including a stock farm, storage warehouse, truck, and air that delivers pork. Relevant information, such as what they ate, how they were slaughtered, and what the temperature in storage rooms was appropriate, are updated in real time on all wallet-related vendor computers using block chain technologies. Because block chains make and store the same copies on every computer on the network, not on a central server (large computer), anyone who participates can identify production and distribution issues immediately. It is virtually impossible to manipulate many copies at once.Because of this benefit, global companies are scrambling to get to the block chain business that can dramatically increase the transparency of transactions. Korea`s focus is on virtual money, but the block chain will dramatically alter the landscape of many industries, including finance, logistics, medical care and content, said KISTI, head of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. The shipping company has developed a shipping logistics system using block chains and has recently begun test operations. From the moment the order is placed to move the products, the entire process is sent to the owners, customs officials, ports, and insurance companies in real-time and stored. A logistics system is created that requires no paperwork at all, since you do not have to complete a separate customs declaration or carry a shipping list. Toyota announced that it would use the block chain for car-sharing systems and Kodak to use its photo transaction.Health and insurance are also transforming. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is pushing for a plan to make all Americans ' medical information block chain. A block of individual medical information enables doctors and hospitals to see a person's medical history at a glance. You don't have to go through an examination every time you move to the hospital, and insurance companies can easily keep track of your customers ' health.◇ Used car and insurance claims have widened, which led to cases in which the ‘ block chain ’ was applied in real life in Korea, although it was rather late compared to overseas ones. Samsung SDS is working with the Seoul Metropolitan Government to introduce block-chaining technology into the Changan used-car market. The used-car market is a typical lemon market, with buyers unable to check its quality and therefore more likely to purchase defective products at higher prices. Consumers have no way to know if their cars are flooded, have an accident history, or have had to operate their driving distances briefly. When a seller said "" no claims "", he had to believe in something even if it was uncomfortable. Samsung SDS plans to transparently manage car repair and accident history by utilizing block chain technologies that are unable to modify or modify.Kyobo Life Insurance has been test-servicing some hospitals since late last year, applying block chain technologies to claim Silson Health Insurance. Until now, patients had to pay for medical treatment at the hospital first, then submit copies of their medical records and insurance claims to an insurance company for insurance. The new block chain method is designed to share medical information among patients, hospitals and insurers. When patients pay for medical care at hospitals, doctors say they will pay for insurance, and all the information can be sent to insurance companies at once to be verified in real-time. This process is written neatly into the block chain and managed transparently. Kim Soo-hyung, director of the Institute of Digital Communication and Technology, said, "" Since block chains will eliminate asymmetry in information, they are all distributed industry technologies that are equally entitled to use when all parties engage in decision-making. ""☞ The blockchain technology distributed storage of certain data to all networked user computers, creating a practically incompactable structure. It means a collection of blocks containing data, such as a virtual currency transaction history, in a row."
"According to psychological analysis conducted by Kim Seong-gwan, a relative of his stepfather, Kwon Jun-woo, the reporter of Yong-Chang-Chang-do, blamed the family for having completed the on-site verification.In the east of Kyong-gil, Gyeonggi Province, the prosecution did not investigate and "" found itself in charge of the crime, "" and added it to a profiler who analyzed the psychology of the suspect Kim Seong-gwan (36) on July 16. Profilers also said, The suspects had a desire to be recognized by their mothers, along with resentment. It has caused anger because the need for recognition has not been met, and the anger has turned into resentment, leading to the crime. However, psychological analysis shows that Kim has a low tendency toward antisocial personality disorder (psychopath). Police dispatched profilers to the apartment in Yong-in, where the criminal identified in the incident murdered mother A (55) and her brother B (14). The profiler examined the mentality of Kim at the time of the crime and spent about three hours in a psychological analysis to derive the results.

As a result of her decision to reveal her face and real name, Kim murdered C in her car and drove her body to a parking lot in a sleepy car park. Regarding choosing a sleepy shelter to carry the body of C, Kim admitted to a joint investigation that said, (en route to the condo) was quoted as saying, It was because the street lights were switched off and people looked sparse.

"The Samjiyeon Orchestra, a delegation of North Korea's Pyeongchang, sent a performance titled "" Samjiyeon Band "" last March under the title of "" Samjiyeon Orchestra's Concert with South Korea's propaganda media. "" The Bangnam Art Club, which was outlined with the first working-level contact between the leaders of the two Koreas on July 15, was not a Moranbong Band but a Samjiyeon Orchestra. The North Korean art group, which plans to host the concert in Gangneung, Gangwon Province, said, "" We will send in a preliminary inspection team to examine the performances and make a final decision. ""○ According to Lee Won-cheol, head of the Korean Symphony Orchestra, whose real name is Marmod-class Orchestra on July 15, the orchestra has 80 to 90 orchestras. In addition, members of the singing and dancing teams will be able to visit the Korean soil to perform their work. However, the exact nature of the Samjiyeon Orchestra is shrouded in mystery. Korean authorities are also checking whether the Samjiyeon Band, the closest orchestra to be established in January 2009, is the same. The original trio is known to be a mixed pop orchestra of the Mansudae Art Club, led by Kim Jong-il, the father of North Korea`s ruling Workers ` Party Chairman Kim Jong-un. If you look at past performances, the band played the violin, cello, harp, trumpet, clarinet, flute, and TimpanI, and individual instruments, including piano and Russian folk musician Bayan. Women are overwhelmingly represented on the string section, and men are mostly holding instruments such as the trombone. It is also possible that the organization of Samjiyeon Band was reorganized with the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics or that other members of the art corps could have formed a coalition by making a provisional plan. In the past, some members of the Samjiyeon Band left Samjiyeon to appear at Moranbong Band's first concert in July 2012. ○ What is the North's intention to present the Samjiyeon Orchestra in place of the North Korean girl group Moranbong, which was not even called Moranbong Band, but Hyun Song-wol could have come? First of all, it is estimated that Moranbong, an orchestra formed after the inauguration of Kim Jong Un in 2012, minimized possible conflicts with the South by producing propaganda. However, since the Samjiyeon band is also related to the control of the arts corps, it is crucial how much effort can be made to reduce the publicity of the North Korean system during future working-level talks. Hyun Song-wol, the de facto head of the orchestra, is also expected to pay a visit to South Korea in working-level talks on that day. After the nine-hour meeting, the South Korean delegation said, "" I'm not sure whether I'm coming or not, "" but the Unification Ministry still decides that Hyun Song-wol, who heads the Moranbong Band can visit.Playing the vocal ensemble, song, and Lion King's OST also made the South Korean Culture and Tourism Ministry's Culture and Arts Policy Director Lee Woo-seong said, "" When North Korea moves into Pyeongchang, it is basically true to the unification and to the world. "" Earlier last year, the Samjiyeon Band performed a New Year's celebration called "" The Joy of the People. "" A YouTube video posted on January 3 last year by North Korea's external propaganda media, ' Today in Joseon, ' showed women in pink dresses and members of boys in purple jackets wanting to ' meet Ryongro. ' Judging from the North Korean media accounts, the azalea and the dark green color are considered symbols of the Samjiyeon Band. The Korean traditional costume of the "" Mother's Day "" concert on November 16, 2016, was similarly dressed as a suit, and the "" Jiyeon Band "" logo appeared on the cover of a music stand to symbolize the azalea. As the Samjiyeon Band plays the OST of the animated movies The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, the compilation of the movie will draw attention.

Shinhan Bank raised its new supply base Copix linked main mortgage rate (six-month floating rate) from 3.12 to 4.43 percent on July 15 to 12.3 to 4.45 percent on July 16. In addition, mortgage rates on the copy-linked home mortgage based on the balance rose 0.04%p from 2.96 to 4.27 percent to 3.00 to 4.31 percent. Woori Bank will also raise its interest rate on loans linked to the KOFIX to 3.19 to 4.19 percent from 3.17 percent and its balance to 4.10 percent from 3.06 to 4.19 percent during the same period. Kookmin Bank will increase its new copy-linked loan rate from 3.26 to 4.46 % to 3.28 to 4.48 %, and its remaining copy-linked rate from 3.54 to 4.50 %. National Agricultural Cooperative Federation raised the copy-intervied loan rate from 2.98 to 4.57 % to 3.0 to 4.59 %, and the revenue-based interest rate was 2.87 to 4.46 %. Hana Bank, however, slightly fell from 3.131 to 4.331 percent on the basis of the new supply and balance to 3.128 to 4.328 percent. Hana Bank shares the lowest and highest rates of copy-linked lending rates with its six-month supply of debt, so the course is not the same as the course of fluctuations in interest rates for its products.As the interest rate of banks increases as shown in the graphic show by Kim Min-jun of Getty Bank, mortgage loans in the two percent range are expected to disappear soon. Last year alone, the copy-based home equity loans at the banks were available to borrow at a rate of at least 2 percent. However, with the rise in the Copyx rate, Hana Bank, Kookmin Bank and Woori Bank have previously raised their mortgage rates to 3 percent. Shinhan Bank had a 2-percent loan rate last month, but increased the key interest rate of the remaining loans from 2.35 percent to 2.40 percent, leaving the mortgage loan rate at the 2-percent level unchanged. The bank can still borrow at the 2-percent interest rate, but the new supply price will go up to 3 percent with the increase of the KOFIX. As the Bank of Korea is expected to raise its key interest rate this year, it is unlikely that the bank will find a 2 percent mortgage loan anytime soon, a bank official said.[Table] Major bank copy-linked home mortgage rates (%) ※ 6-month floating rate, each bank provided (tip and inquiry). 1:1 communication with reporters ; Pyeongchang Winter Olympics Video Contest"

Even investors who used to make long term investments, "" believing the possibility of a virtual currency, are short-lived as investors turn their backs after the announcement of government measures, "" said a large number of short-term investors. That is why critics say the government is encouraging the overheated speculation, which has been blamed for the ills of virtual money. A office worker started investing last summer after hearing from an acquaintance about block chains and virtual money. He looked up data on the block chain, studied the possibilities of the development of virtual currency, and bought a coin called the "" big brother. "" After that, he did not ignore the fluctuations in the market price and checked the flow once every few days. However, after experiencing a sharp decline in the market price in July and September last year, he sold all of the bit coins and then repeated the strategy of selling them for a short time. After switching to a single market, I don`t get my hands on things from watching the charts all day long, he said, warning of the sudden government action, and that virtual currency would become a piece of sleep overnight. "" Bittu-coin is a concept that has been centralized since the 2008 global economic crisis, "" he said, adding, "" It is a concept that has been set aside as an alternative to the current currency or the bank system. "" However, it is possible to utilize the technology for a few years. Government employees are equally anxious. After Justice Minister Park Sang-kee announced Monday that the price of virtual currency dropped more than 20 percent following the closing of the Korea Exchange, prosecutors are looking at the charts out of the blue. "" The government first described Kim as a problem with virtual currency and then changed the policy to make it look like overheated speculation is the problem, "" he said. We don`t understand that Kim would like to block the transaction by regulating the exchange to correct the problem, and by imposing transaction taxes if the single strikes are caused by overheated speculation. First, we should clearly analyze the problem and find the alternatives. Similar stories are being raised in the online virtual currency community. One investor said, "" The government will go into various regulations and close when people eventually leave the coin market, "" adding, "" John is an old horse, and he may go to the overseas market by taking a single bet … "" `` I believed there was an answer to the long pitch, but I wasn't sure if I would make it difficult to sell at the high point (even when I was about to) and buy at the low point. '' Some point out that ' only the Danta people eventually get full because they are swayed by government regulations. ' The irony is that whenever the government announces regulations, the market is overheated, as the access to the stock exchange is so explosive. An official at the Virtual Monetary Exchange said, "" The government's announcement on virtual currency regulations only triggers a surge in the number of people who have access to the currency or ask for new subscriptions, "" adding, "" The exchange is trying to appease the overheated market. As the price fluctuations have worsened since the announcement of the measures, the number of long-term investment members who have made a single decision is greatly increasing. goals@yna.co.kr"
"- Kim Joon-young, head of the block chain Korea - Virtual currency, Korea is the dominant currency - [Daily journalist Kim Yoo-seong] stressed the necessity of nurturing technology in block chains. But this was called speculation in Korea. "" While the speculation over virtualized currency and surrounding regulatory movements are going on in the government, "" Kim Joon-young, head of the Korea Development Bank, is quoted as saying by the nation's leading conglomerate. In a petition that was registered on July 15, Kim urged the government to change its perception of block chains and virtual currency. In the beginning, he took a back seat to the phrase, Korea is a poor country in financial standing, which, in turn, likened to speculation and gambling as the investment of encrypted money. The block chain, the engine that moves the Bitcone, is the second Internet, Kim said, diagnosing it as whatever changes the world will bring about with it. The block chain uses an encryption algorithm, such as an accredited certificate. Free credit transactions are possible without intervention from the central government or the bank. In the past, various services, such as electronic voting, were implemented that could not be easily attempted due to security and trust issues. Kim claimed that Korea has taken a new opportunity in the virtual currency market during the era of block chains. The world`s power of the Korean won didn`t have the power to match the world`s 10th largest economy, he asserted, however, Korea`s dominance in encrypted currency surpassed the dollar. It is called speculation in Korea, but users of encrypted currency are called an insight, comparing the cow to have a chicken that lays golden eggs when it walks backward. Kim stressed that the Korean government should encourage block chains. It reiterated that a tax-oriented bill should become a policy, not a regulation, as a way to protect the dealers. We should not miss the opportunity and build a national competitiveness in the future by encouraging mining, he said, stressing that the Republic of Korea is not a regulation but a block chain hub. At the end of the petition, he promised to make a donation of 1 billion won to the government directly if he accepts his proposal. "" Crisis "" is the standard of what we call ' crisis and opportunity, "" he said. "" We hope to seize opportunities.

"Office Over-Doctor Policy to Cut the Amount of Employees ' Working by 40 % By 2022, the comprehensive measures to improve government agencies ' work by 100 % … The current goal of using less time (Yonhap) is to streamline efficiency by giving up on the necessity. First, the government will compensate for overtime starting in the first half of this year with not only money, but also "" time, "" and from this winter, it will introduce a winter vacation system to encourage people to exhaust their winter vacation.The Personnel Revolution Administration and the Ministry of Public Administration and Security announced Monday a joint package of government agency work and innovation measures at a Cabinet meeting. As Kim Pan-seok, director of the personnel affairs office, said, "" The civil sector should start to innovate and form an example of an effective working environment in which the public sector is prevalent in our society. "" In 2016, the average overtime work time for government employees at the central government ministries was 31.5 hours for non-working positions and 70.4 hours for working in the field. The average number of days given to the drama is 20.4 days, but the days spent using the drama was only 103 days (50.5 percent). Current jobs require regular work such as police and customs, or regular work hours during weekends and holidays. As such conditions cause many social problems, such as decreased efficiency, low birth rates and over-reaction, the government has promoted innovation in the military service system _ and secured a system for personnel management. The government expects a ' work-life balance ' to be achieved when work and life balance is established. ◇ Service system innovation … The government has decided to efficiently perform necessary work hours, but has set up a flexible and flexible work schedule to provide the best working conditions. If they work overtime, they will be able to make up for their time when they are less busy, such as working shorter hours or using the drama as a drama. For this, the ministry decided to ease the 8-hour workweek system and the 40-hour workweek system. Until now, overtime was only paid with money. The Office of Personnel Affairs announced it would enact a revision to the national civil servant service regulations later this month, and put it into effect in late March or early April. It plans to provide a "" winter vacation "" system (January to March) to promote the use of the drama not only during the summer vacation but also during the winter vacation season. The office will send out an official letter to each ministry this winter concerning the operation of the system. The savings period of the drama, which will carry the rest of the drama forward, will be extended from five years to 10 years, allowing it to be utilized as a long-term vacation when necessary, such as the education of children, self-improvement and parents ' support. In particular, the authority to designate and operate field employees will be tightly reviewed by the head of the institution to determine if a regular work system is required and the results of such decisions will be disclosed. The number of field office workers is currently 121,000 in 32 ministries, followed by the National Police Agency (70,000), the Science and Technology Information Administration (postal service), and the Ministry of Justice (12,000). ◇ The government's decision to abandon unnecessary work and make bold decisions on what is customary, and proactively seek to reform the work needed to be done as times change, and thus smart. Report is prepared based on key information and minimizes one-way meetings with people. In addition, through the spread of smart work environment based on ICT, such as mobile electronic government and government cloud services, the company plans to report and make decisions freely. For example, an official from Seoul-Sejongsang to the Seoul area will access the mobile electronic government via a smartphone to sign in and do business outside of the office by accessing the government remote work service (GVPNS) via a laptop if needed. Each agency will prepare work process analysis programs to solve bottlenecks that could affect one person. ICT and advanced automation technologies will be utilized, especially for routine or repetitive shifts. Police used drones to search missing persons, save lives and patrol areas, and the Korea Post introduced smart mailboxes and mail sorting machines, and the Ministry of Justice reduced unnecessary work hours by adding an automatic screening force. The Ministry of Government Administration and Security implements ‘ pan-government work innovation guidelines ’ with these contents and establishes its own plans by agencies through an advisory group composed of private experts. The ministry also plans to streamline human resources operations by relocating 5 % of existing gardens to other areas where new administrative demands occurred and on-site services were needed.◇ Central ministries ' implementation of…The measure, in conjunction with the assessment and evaluation department, is to be first implemented by the central government agencies and other related ministries and agencies for its spread, which will be reviewed later. Each ministry shall regularly report its performance and plans for implementation to the Cabinet meeting, including plans for service innovation, when reporting new year's work. The office called for cooperation late last year to reflect the findings in its 2018 report on government affairs. The performance assessment is strengthened by reflecting the results of the department manager's own use of the song on the assessment, and the performance of the work innovation is reflected in the organization and budgeting every year. Agencies that have failed to perform service innovation are expected to consult with the Office of Service Innovation Diagnosis Task Force, and the Office of Personnel Management and to provide support for personnel reshuffle of the on-site workforce. noanoa@yna.co.kr and online reporting and questioning by reporters.

"Don't answer whether or not to revoke the ban …? (Yonhap news, Sejong = Yonhap) Ko Yoo-seon : The Ministry of Education apologized for the confusion surrounding banning the special English activities of kindergartens and childcare centers. The ministry, however, repeatedly pointed out that the current English extracurricular activities have many problems, but declined to comment on whether the government is backing down on the ban or whether it should review details such as when to hold on and enforce it. The following is an interview with Education and Welfare Policy Director Shin Ik-hyeon -- He said, "" We will announce plans to improve the English education after kindergarten and kindergarten next year. So far, the ministry has refused to allow special English activities to be done as much as possible and has taken an exception. What I'm saying today is that I don't want to leave the worries that could hamper the children's development. Since the method has not been discussed internally alone, I will listen to the opinions of the people and find ways to improve it with a more open mind. -- Explain clearly. Does the Ministry of Education still hold that it is not right to teach English before the third grade? ▲ elementary school was put into effect after collecting opinions for three and a half years. In a big way, kindergarten children need consistency, too. However, it is advised to open the door to such measures as when they are applied, how they are prohibited by the Ministry of Education by law, and how they are done by the education office. -- Will the lifting of the ban be discussed? ▲ (withdrawal) depends on how you view it, so it is hard to say something now. -- What will happen to childcare centers? -- What is the discretion of the superintendent? If they have discretion, it is also unnecessary for the education authorities to demand a decision from the ministry. ▲ and present. The education ministry can still give guidelines on the after-school curriculum, but the education superintendent himself can lead and supervise them. It is not only the national affairs but also the education superintendent's office. The review began because 17 education offices requested that the Ministry of Education prohibit the practice starting in March this year. We respect the decision of the education office. However, since the Ministry of Education has a guideline after school (special English activities), the principle of exclusion applies nationwide, and the part that bans education superintendent's opinions is also respected, not entirely autonomous. - I think the education authorities have turned their back on the ban because they personally believe it would be a good idea to do so. ▲ Education Office and the Education Ministry should not explain their relationship in any way. Although there have been many issues concerning this part of the project on site, there has not been an official appearance on the surface until recently. Since the post-schools and hagwon regulations are all based on the will of the superintendent, the education office and education office should share the same part. -- The current government's administrative tasks and policies continue to create friction. ▲ and sorry for yourself. It is not a system problem. I will do my best to manage the people's opinions and agendas not to repeat such a thing. -- What do you think is the problem with English education at school? ▲ Our children learn English from the third grade, or the first grade of elementary school, and then it is the responsibility of the government to ease their anxiety of learning Korean and following them well. If it doesn't work out, we'll do the best we can. -- If you allow for play-based education, it's not that different. ▲ After school course, especially English is often carried out on a large scale by external instructors rather than kindergarten teachers, and there are occasions when there is a high cost and over-textured education. It is a move to reduce the gap between good and bad kindergartens to improve after-school activities to the level of formal education, and to improve the identity of after-school programs to better prepare children for elementary school. -- What is the specific nature of the revision to the English language institute? ▲ ' English kindergarten ', but it's not a kindergarten, it's an institute. The criteria for accreditation of English institutes for infants is the same as for adult English academies. We need to start the public discussion because we have not dealt with the admission standards appropriate to infants in terms of lessons and facilities. - What are the plans to crack down on special activities after high school, expensive English institutes for infants and children? ▲ After school, the process is priced and there are many complaints about whether or not it is being used properly by children. It is intended to strengthen specific audits on this part. Hagwons should be thoroughly examined for proper facilities, teaching time, and there is ample scope for regulations to be adopted. cindy@yna.co.kr Lee Tae-yoon, a 30-year-old currier who specializes in curry products in Shincheon, Seoul, has received Bitcons since October 2016. Thanks to the people who pay by the handnets per week, I have collected 4 bit coins so far. However, they have been cut off since the middle of last year. It is a phenomenon stemming from the fact that the Bitcoin price last year surpassed 5 million won, said Kim, as the tendency to view it as an investment product rather than a payment method has kept it from being used in everyday transactions. A 41 year-old owner of a cafe in Suyeong-gu, Busan, has a similar situation. Since July last year, he has received coffee prices in Bitcons for two to three occasions a month. So far, it has collected 0.08 of them. Considering the present value of the Bit-coins (19 million won), it costs about 1.5 million won. But he no longer accepts bit coins. The payment has become infrequent and the fees have gone up a hundred times since "" It costs 2,500 won per cup of coffee, but it costs more than that, "" he said. As the price of Bitcone increases and investment fever rises, the function of the money is deteriorating. As the price of Bitcone rapidly rises, the perception of "" the earlier you use it, the worse it is. "" The notion of seeing a bit coin as an investment method rather than as a "" cipher currency "" has also encouraged this phenomenon. According to Application-coint coin maps that guide businesses that can pay for bills, about 150 Korean stores are available as of last December. It has tripled from December 2016 to December 2016. The map shows stores with a strong bill payable in Seoul, Kyonggi, Incheon, and Busan. But there are not many places where actual transactions are made. Amid the Bitcone craze late last year, many stores offered to accept Bitcoins, but they say in unison, "" I have never seen a customer pay for anything. "" Smartphone Application screen used for payment by Bitcone at the Appropriation Mall. You simply acknowledge the QR code and enter the payment information. Reporter Lee Tae-yoon yesterday visited an underground shopping center at the Gangnam Express Bus Terminal. Out of 650 stores, 150 started accepting Bitcons last December. However, no one saw the coin in person at 16 places the reporter visited. One of our employees who sell accessories said, "" Our customers are in their teens or 20s, and teenagers can not use Bitcoin anyway. I have not heard that the store next door has also made a payment. Rojas, a furniture store on Fortune Furniture Street in Kyonggi Province, which introduced the Bitcone Payment System on July 15, was in a similar situation. They even hung a banner in front of the store saying, "" Bitcone payment is possible, "" but it did not respond. As Bitcone is so popular, we have adopted the payment system, but we don`t have many inquiries and never paid it in actual terms, a store official said. A system official at J.I.Hyun, who will receive Bitchin from four stores nationwide, also said, I understand that there are four stores in the country and nobody calls to ask for them. ▽ Graphic : Cha Joon-hong, a reporter at cha.junhong@joongang.co.kr A cafe in Gyeonggi Province, who declined to be named, said, It is better for employers to accept cash or credit cards because each exchange has different price tags, changes in the price of money and fees at different times. A local hagwon director who registered for private institute fees with Bitchin said, "" I don't think I've been interested since I attended a forum two years ago, so I'm ready to collect more cipher money, but it's very variable. "" A cafe located in Suyeong-gu, Busan, recently stopped paying Bitcone and changed its payment to Bitcone Cache. Lee Eun-ji, a researcher at Dongguk University's block chain research center, said, We believe price stability is a precondition for the use of encrypted money as a payment method in general transactions, and therefore we should not consider the functionality of encrypted money to be confined to future payments.Lee Tae-yoon, Choi Eun-ji, reporter of Seoul, Suwon, Busan, and mit [Central Daily News Agency, Facebook + Web Site, and http://joongang.co.kr [Mobile]"
""" I will return to the Korea Party as fellow of the local residents, "" Park In-sook, the chairman of the GNP's supreme council and the chairman of the ruling Grand National Party, declared on July 16. With Park leaving, the number of seats in the right-party parties dropped to 9. The right party has dropped from 33 to one digit in one year since it was formed in January 2017, when it has only three seats left in the party. When Park returns to the Korea Party, the GNP will have 118, while the GNP will have only three seats with the GNP's majority of 121 seats.Park told reporters on the same day that he followed the wishes of residents who have chosen to become local council members in the past two elections and members of the ruling party who have given their full support to be elected.I don`t want to see the future efforts of many people who love the right party and those who have paid attention to the right party, I say, you know.I will do my best to help the development of the Republic of Korea by doing all that I have in the future, he added. Meanwhile, the ruling party and the opposition parties are concerned that the sudden departure of Park would make the third defection a reality. Rep. Kim Se-yeon earlier left the party on July 8 to return to the GNP, and Gyeonggi Province Governor Nam Kyung-pil, who belongs to the right party, returned to the Korea Party on July 15.Now you see a few articles by your side : receive free cartoons and gifts.Foreign news agencies including the United States ' Fox News Agency reported on Tuesday that their families were affected by the incident when they had been photographed by a professional photographer.Pam Jarring from St. Louis, Missouri, saw a photographer's campaign last May to describe himself as a "" skilled writer. ""The cost of shooting was 250 dollars, and the price of Korean money was 260,000 won, which was cheaper than other companies.Pam has never taken a proper family photo since she married her husband Dave three years ago, so she decided to have the photographer take one. However, the picture that arrived just a month after the shoot was a shock itself.Her face had no wrinkles. Her skin was stiff, eyes, nose, and mouth were like robots, not people.  Pam complained to the photographer, she returned with an evasive answer.I tried to get rid of it because the shadows on my face weren't good, but I never really learned how to adjust.Pam said, "" When I showed my pictures to the two boys, I thought they were joking. "" "" They said it was like a toy. "" Eventually, they couldn't even get a refund, but the Jarrings laughed and decided to go away.Pam says, "" I don't think I've laughed so much in the past year, "" she says, "" It's a strange, but pleasant experience to leave at first. "" Zaring's family photos have been shared about 400,000 times since they were released to Facebook, and are making a huge splash.

Nevertheless, it was apparent that he was exhausted because he had lined up at 6:30 a.m. I waited for my daughter three hours on the spot because she had tried to book me online but could not because of an overlap in rush hour, Cho said, I don`t think I could make the on-site purchase again.Jang, 34, who had come to Busan to buy a ticket to her husband's home, said, "" It was easy to get tickets for Chuseok because it was easy to get there at 9 a.m. Last year, but I could get tickets for Chuseok.

"Electric Vehicle Evolution at CES 2018 Toyotato, FutureFutur Mobilitarization and Hyundai Motor is the next generation hydrogen car, the car that can not be seen in front of ‘ Nekso ’ and ` electric cars that are in front of us. ` The future of the eco-friendly car market can not be hurried between electric cars and hydrogen cars. In the recent Seages, companies tried to occupy the next generation car market with a fierce battle of their own. Toyota unveiled its new concept of its next-generation electric car, the e-Palel. A means of transportation that enables the user to transform the way they use it and the shape of their vehicle by utilizing the linked and Autonomous Driving Technologies. Founded by Tesla, Beembe (BMW) and Nissan executives, the Chinese electric car startup Future Mobility unveiled the electric car brand Viton. Meanwhile, Hyundai Motors has placed its next generation hydrogen car, Nekso, at the front. With a capacity of nearly 600 kilometers and the durability of an internal combustion engine, the car is about to go into production. Mercedes-Benz was also a recent project to develop hydrogen cars. Hydrogen cars are being developed not only in Europe but also in the United States and China, but only a few places, including Hyundai Motor Co. and Toyota, have produced mass-produced models. The sudden plunge to Benz has helped the hydrogen market stronger. Hydrogen cars are considered the ultimate environmentally friendly vehicles with no pollution other than water. However, the high price of cars and a lack of charging infrastructure were the biggest obstacles to the expansion. Hyundai Motors developed the world's first hydrogen electric mass production car (Tucson) in 2013, but the supply volume is not very high. The hydrogen electric car has a shorter charging time than regular electric cars and has the advantage of being able to travel much farther on a single charge. However, the disadvantage is the need for a separate charging infrastructure. Is Hyundai a hydrogen car? That's not true. Hyundai Motors put hydrogen cars first, but Kia Motors released electric cars. Yang Ung-chul, the company`s research and development vice chairman, stressed, Electric and hydrogen cars must coexist in the race for future eco-friendly cars. Whether it is for long distances or short distances, we should look at it separately and hydrogen cars should go to hydrogen tanks, coexisting with electric cars as they do with electric cars, he said. At the Hyundai Motor Exhibition Hall, an employee introduces the next generation hydrogen car, Nekso. Since both electric cars provided by Hyundai Motor and hydrogen have both merits and limitations, experts can not predict which models will take the lead in the future. However, so far, electric cars are one step ahead. Tesla's model of a car, the Tesla Nuriga, is currently the most famous owner in the electric car industry. However, as an automaker, Tesla's risks are high. Battery prices are unstable, with the production of popular supply cars, Model 3, and battery material lithium and cobalt, nearly tripled in the past year.

Until now, however, geological studies on how the highlands was formed have been deficient.First, they identified the age of the mineral ' low carbon ' in the region's rocks as being approximately 300 million years old between the flat - and stair-layer ' coal '. The sedimentary rock is in the form of sandstone, composed primarily of sand particles measuring 1 to 2mm in millimetre, in which the ‘ Alpine Jungseon Stadium ’ of PyeongChang's Olympic Games is held.The researchers said the sedimentary rock in the Taebaek basin was at the center of a collision involving the entire nation some 250 million years ago, creating a huge geological conflict, which led to "" the collapse of the mountain chain. ""Later, the Pacific plate moved in under the Korean Peninsula and an orogen movement began, creating 170 million years of Jurasso-Financian-Chinese-Seoul granite. The researchers believe the probe is still ongoing.To infer from a relatively old age, the researchers introduced a dating method for ' He ' of phosphorite. As a result, the Asian continent, the fringes of the East Sea sea water, there are 22 million years ago when that power the inside of the continent to Taebaek Mountain Range, which was elevated to interpretation. In other words, through the rise, the Taebaek Mountains and Pyeongchang Ski Resort were built.Lee Kang-keun, a professor of the local environmental science department at Seoul National University, said, It is the first time that Pyeongchang has been selected as the venue of the Olympics ` venue for international academic studies, adding, It is the origin of the Pyeongchang Olympics ` event.The results of the study were published in the journal International Geology Review on July 15.Somangchoi @."
"If you want to forge anything you need to counter…..the current system doesn't allow for the outflow of information … hacking is a problem on the virtual currency exchange, "" the act of block trading is a lot of human beings. "" Contracts are at the base of every single song, every time you exchange money through an intermediary at the bank, every time you insure a used car or a house, and every time you trade in second-hand cars. Banks, insurance companies, real estate and sound platforms ensure that the contracts are safe and take their consequences.If there are no brokers trapped between the dealers, that is, if direct dealing, there is no need to be a fee. Although all of the dealers can profit from the elimination of transaction costs, the challenge remains how to realize the safe deals that brokers ensured.The block chain is highlighted as a technique to fundamentally address these issues. Because not all customer transaction information is saved and managed by one institution, but by many people all transaction information is shared and managed by others. The concept of block chain technology, which existed only as a concept since the early 1980s, was actually implemented by SatoshI Nakamoto (alias), who was known as the creator of Bitcone, and the first result was unveiled in 2009.In its 2008 paper, Satosi "" was able to use the virtual currency directly online and for payment of its virtual currency, without the need for genuine P2P (direct access to financial institutions). ""In block chains, transaction information is contained in Block. When the block is full, the system closes down and displays a number outlining the transaction information within. When this number is connected to the next block as if it were a chain, only the last block should be checked to allow for rapid verification of the up and down modulation. Participants will share this information on their computers and store it. No one can modify information on the ‘ block chain ’ randomly and anyone can access the results of such changes to prevent data from being uploaded and to secure reliability and transparency in transactions.The block chain is rated to be the safest approach to trade. For them to be counterfeitable, all of the book's blocks must be changed because the existing system can not. The fact that virtual currency exchanges are hacked into and personal information including bank accounts is leaked has nothing to do with block chains. The exchange provides participants with a "" purse "" that serves as a safe deposit box but does not operate on a block chain basis. Cyber Defense Department professor Kim Hyung-jung of Korea University said, The information on block chains is open to everyone. Information leaking from the block chain can not be established in the first place, said the bank, which is not a loophole in the block chain but a loophole in the market. "" The biggest problem with the virtual currency exchange is that it does not use block chain technologies, "" said Kim Jong-hwan, head of the exchange's management system.As the volume of transactions continues, you should create a new block of information. The process of creating a new block is called mining. To make a new block, you must first solve the big problem of calculation. The network's computing power was then adjusted to make the problem difficult to solve, and if not, the difficulty was to create one block every 10 minutes. The newly extracted blocks are considered valid only when half or more of the existing block owners agree on them. In return for providing the blocks, the mining participants will receive a virtual call. Without the virtual currency, it would be impossible to maintain the ecosystem of block chains. It is unrealistic to nurture individual block chains by separating them from virtual currencies, said Kim, referring to power transactions and insurance claims using block chains that also have the function of virtual currencies. The block chain aims at decentralization in that it gives the individual full power, not the central institution, and determines everything according to their agreement. Individuals can also issue money that the state has been monopoly on. Computer science professor Inho Korea University, a block chain, said, Using the block chain enables us to see where the ups and downs occurred, enabling direct voting and making it impossible to implement democracy.

"[CBS [Cisazaro : Chung Kwan-Chang's Office] - Warren Buffett's ' The End of Cryptosystems won't Be Good ' - Guardian : France's Case Studies Show : 20 % Possible Park-dodging System : No Government Can Be Ahead - Welcome, Director Im Sang-hoon of the International Center for Critic and Arts. How are you? ◇ Government use > What news shall we listen to first? I can almost say for sure that the end of encrypted money is not good. Of course, I don't have a position to say that. And it's not my word, it's Warren Buffett. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong : Warren Buffett : A genius of investing. And I don't mean to defend Warren Buffett's comment. And I don't mean to argue that, but I do think the active debate about virtual money in the country recently, the foreign media, is starting to get interested in it again. The Guardian newspaper in Britain reported on last week 11 on the virtual currency boom in Korea. And I mentioned it at the beginning, because I now quoted Warren Buffett at the end of the article. The Guardian says he will never sit back and avoid tax evasion when it comes to cryptoking money from anywhere in the world. ◇ Government service > Don't you think our country is more boisterous now? So the foreign press is reporting the virtual currency controversy in Korea. Mr Im Sang-hoon > Yes. So when you look at the foreign news media coverage of the virtual currency controversy in this country, you can imagine that. Do you feel like you're seeing things first in Korea? I feel like I am watching various responses among investors, the government and the people in Korea. The Guardian in Britain, as I just introduced, has two sides to the story about the virtual currency crisis in Korea, and I think that's what I'm saying. First of all, the Korean government said that increasing sanctions would prove that it is worth investing in encrypted currency. ◇ Government sanctions, government sanctions, government sanctions -- you can think, well, there is something here. Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. So, you can think in reverse. Now, if you're talking about reverse logic, and you do it safely and safely, then this paper says, you'd better look for something else to invest in. So, real supporters of Bitcone can buy it now and try to get on a roller coaster and wait until it recovers, but no government would be able to do anything to keep their hands off the Korean government. Every government wants to keep the monetary system intact and act on encrypted currency if it becomes a problem. ◇ Government service > ` It is all being used as a dispossession `, ` this is a problem `, all of which agree? But when you reprimand this, you actually deprecate technology. Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. But I'm starting to wonder if there's any logical confusion in the argument that's going on over this virtual currency. If you look at the logic of the people who are protesting against these virtual monetary sanctions, do they think they're resisting the advances of technology, or do they think they're going to deal with the threat of an excessive speculative force? For example, when we talk about government involvement, we often see people refuting block chains and encrypted money by going down like this. If they say so, I understand, but it is hard for even the eating generation to understand why they are simply disobeying government intervention and sanctions as resistance to technology. Now, I'm going to show you a little bit earlier, from this point of view, the Guardian newspaper, right? Bitcoin (Photo : Data photo) ◇ Straint you wrote about it? Wouldn't it be that the price of an Imsanghoon > Bitcone can vary significantly depending on the number of stores it takes to mine its limited supply? And I think, in that sense, you could compare it with minerals like jewelry, but the government didn't just let it go, did it? So when something becomes a social scale phenomenon, governments have no choice but to intervene in some form because even if there is a technological evolution, overheated speculation is also evolved. As the Guardian pointed out in a Korean case, ◇ Government intervention is needed in dealing with overheated speculation. Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. What the foreign press keeps saying is, the most important thing is overheating. They say that the virtual currency transaction amount currently being made in our country is higher than that in the U.S., that is, at the highest price in the world. Jung Kwan-yong : Isn't it true that there is a saying that goes, "" Kimchi premium? "" Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. So the idea is that it's paying more than 30 percent of the premium price to trade, which is not sustainable in terms of a country's economic standards, is that if it doesn't, it's going to create an ideal fire pollution. In the French newspaper Le Figaro, today. Currently, 20 % of the world market's Bitcone exchange is in Korea. This is 10 times larger than the size of the Korean economy. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > South Korea does not represent 20 % of the global economy. ; It is not ; it is not. Eventually, Bitcone may have benefited some investors significantly, but the Korean newspaper says it is too dangerous for the general public, and therefore the Korean government is trying to control Figaro. So, I'm going to fight against the money that's going to be sold exclusively by the central bank, but if it's virtual, and it only adds to the confusion of the monopoly, why should people want it? ◇ Government policy > Guardian or Le Figaro, the British and French influential, and that's why the government can't sit still. Now that the government has made such a comment on the matter, it says that more than 200,000 people have applied for sanctions against the presidential office, especially young people. But the do was Moon Jae-in and the government's support base is young people? Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. Japan's Nikkei has just reported on this. It's Moon Jae-in government's brewing dilemma and introduce so. This is a dilemma. The Nikkei newspaper reported on July 13, but most of the investors in the virtual currency market are in their 20s and 30s. That is why they overlap with the main support groups of the current administration. If they dream of making a fortune at once and are speculative enough to shake the common sense of the labor-based economy, the regulations will be tightened, but resistance by them is more than expected. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > Didn't the foreign press analyze why the younger generation was especially angry? Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. So, these are the words of the petitions posted in Cheong Wa Dae. Have you ever had the government make people dream? Investment is the individual responsibility, whether an individual succeed or fails, in a petition now posted on the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae, and if an individual becomes a group, wouldn't it matter if that failure were a social problem? ◇ Government use > That's the problem. Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. As the Nikkei newspaper focuses on this point, it explains, "" The Korean people's dream is to make a fortune at one time, so they are going to escape from the earth. "" However, is this really the dream of the working class that a society should encourage and promote? The problem is that we have to ask ourselves questions that society might be misinting indicators. It is this that requires the eyes of foreign media outside, so why not question the younger generation and make them feel like they are being unclean? So when you read this article in the Nikkei newspaper, you can see that these guys have a huge dissatisfaction with the older generation, this great dissatisfaction, that they have, they can hide together. ◇ Government service > The young generation is based on the great dissatisfaction of the older generation, and the older generation is not claiming virtual currency restrictions. So you are against the regulation of virtual currency? Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. So, the younger generation is dreaming of making a fortune off virtual currency, as the Nikkei newspaper said earlier. So now, when you're a grown-up, you have found in this speculation that you have an abnormal profit structure that's not virtual money, but you can't compare it to real estate. ◇ Government use. While they are safely inside, the younger generation looks to a giant adult apartment that can never get inside while working outside. They go in there."
"I don't think you're so desperate you can't. So the only way that you can do that is you're looking for a single room, a virtual currency, like the older generation. Lim Sang-hoon, an international affairs commentator (photo : ShisazakI), and Jeong Kwan-yong > In short, the relative sense of deprivation of the existing system of young people is based on this. That's what you say. ⑨ Im Sang-hoon > So, complaints about the existing system are being raised as a reaction to sanctions related to Bitcone, which is an analysis made. In fact, is it not true that the prices of apartments in some areas of Seoul still go up everyday? ◇ Government use > Yes. If the coin market regulation story is mentioned at the same time, how can the younger generation accept it? Wouldn't it be possible for our society to become darker and darker as the shadows of rising apartment prices? So some of these young people are dreaming of making a fortune out of virtual currency, and what kind of innocent people would throw stones at? ◇ For government use > But when you want to apply the brakes, don't you think you should walk? Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. ◇ Government's intent is to apply the brakes, as young people with relatively deprived attitudes are another important aspect of the administration. So, is it a dilemma? Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. So, the Nikkei newspaper sees this as the dilemma of the current government, but it's clear that if we don't get stuck in another round of government, we're in a crisis that won't make it any worse. According to the Nikkei newspaper, security is still very weak on the South Korean virtual currency exchange. ◇ Government use > Didn't the exchange get hacked recently? Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. ◇ Government use > bankruptcy. Mr Im Sang-hoon : That is it. We are exposed to the danger of hacking by North Korea, or by someone else, if not necessarily. I hate to imagine, but if for any reason, if it were to happen, who would deal with the harm? That is, it would be a detriment to the general public, so should the government remain idle at this stage? In other words, it is a time when the government can not delay its engagement, but if the administration decides to tighten regulations and decides to hold off on its plan to run an election, the people will have to pay attention. Don't you tell me a lot about national sovereignty after candles? But I think that the sovereignty over responsibility should be shared with this opportunity. That's interesting, after all, that influential British, French, and Japanese papers are focusing on the controversy over the cipher code in Korea, which is a very special phenomenon in itself. ^ Im Sang-hoon > Yes. ◇ Use of government officials > What else do you have to say?I would like to tell you about the Olympics. Isn't it a feast of mankind? But there are actually several events that are available to the host country that are a celebration of humanity. Isn't the torch relay one of them? ◇ Government use > Yes. Although the relay is still in progress, foreign media outlets are also making related reports, saying, "" Peace is the key word of the Olympics. "" I think it's the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics where the world's attention and support for peace is being concentrated, and I can tell you that it's after last year's missile talks between the United States and North Korea were very harsh. But now, while watching North Korea's decision to participate in the Olympics and some of the events, such discussions on forming a joint team between the two Koreas are secure and assured of security. The German newspaper Bildzie reports on July 12, "" If you're talking about North Korean athletes ' participation, you're being reassured by German stars, "" and say, "" If you do this, it's a guarantee that North Korea has sent out 500 athletes to Iraq. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > So, there was a fear among the foreign players that something was going on in Korea. Mr Im Sang-hoon : Yes. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > But the participation of North Korean athletes is reassuring? ^ Im Sang-hoon > Yes. So this paper also tells us the joke that Biltsee talks about with each other : biathlon, which is one of the things you can ski and shoot outside. It's not a firing range, it's a big spread out space, and you're telling a joke : ' North Koreans can't shoot their own athletes, so we can't get shot in the face of it. And he was another world champion in the same field. And a player called Benedict Stone did an interview, and he said, "" Well, I don't know what happened. He said he was especially pleased to hear that this Olympics might unite the two Koreas and pave the way for future dialogue. ◇ Government use > Does this mean that the anxiety factor is completely eliminated? First of all, the anxiety factor of the North Korean foot has disappeared, and now the fear of playing with fire from the North has been removed, but the fear of playing with fire from the U.S. was revealed in Germany. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > U.S. Firefighting. Im Sang-hoon > This is a daily paper called Frankfurter Lundschau from Germany. It's a reserve, too. July 12th copy on the sidewalk Anyway, I think this Olympics, and the Trump interview only Deutscher Olympischer Sportbund, Alfonso hoeeo president probably don't see is playing with.I've to say. ◇ Government use > Such concerns remain. Okay. Thank you, Director Im Sang-hoon of the Center for the Arts. Thank you very much. [Go straight to CBS Sisazaki's Homepage] [Go straight to CBS Sisazaki Facebook Page] ▶ Redestributing BTC Nortcut and Cartoke News Redistributions ; "" Suggested by Norcott News &amp; amp ; Mobile Hot woong@cbs.co.kr This indicates that the mining of additional bit coins is becoming more difficult. However, the assessment is mixed. While birticinists argued that "" the bit coin value would go up more because of scarcity, "" the pessimists described "" it as an absolute payment method that would never be evaluated as being because of its limitations. "" According to the virtual currency industry on July 16, the amount of the bit-coined big-coin`s total extractible amount of 22.1 million BTCs was exceeded 80 percent of the total on July 13. As a result, the amount of bit coins that can be extracted has dropped to less than 4.2 million BTCs. Bitchine is designed to have a total mining issue of 21 million BTCs since it was created in 2009. The upper limit was designed to prevent "" inflation "" by preventing the "" money supply "" of the bit coin from growing indefinitely. Bitcone can be paid by network members to participate in the process of creating a unit called a block that gathers, records, and authenticates transactions that have occurred. Each time a new block is created, a new bit coin is created and the member who made the block gets it, called mining. In addition, the member who created the block may receive a "" fee "" from the transaction party (receiver) in return, but this takes over the bill of bits already created and does not affect the total of the bit coins. Bitcher was first extracted with 50 BTCs per block in 2009, but by November 2012, the volume of per-block coins issued for mining has been halved by 12.5 BTCs per block. This process takes about four years at each stage. The total printable unit of the bit coin is the sum of the infinite geometric series calculated on this basis and its value is 22.1 million BTC.
