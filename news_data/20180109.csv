Kim has been to UAE three times as the Defense Minister (September 2009 - December 2010) of the MB government and closed the military cooperation with UAE. Regarding the secret military agreement with the UAE, former Minister Kim said in an interview with The JoongAng Ilbo, "" Rather than taking it to the National Assembly hastily, I was willing to make a choice on the best part of the agreement. "" But, Former Defense Minister Kim Tae-young had actually been unable to explain the clause in the pact under which Korean troops would automatically intervene in emergencies in the UAE, even if it was not ratified by the National Assembly. He was “Moon Jae-in government is trying to patch up any misunderstanding between the two countries to refrain from doing so as not to have been a problem because of the statement.” and "" The regime and left the party.Cheong Wa Dae for the good of the trust must patch things up with uae, said. Kim is the first administration official to talk about the case. The interview was held around an hour and a half ago at Kim's home in Yong-in, Gyeonggi Province. The following is an interview. Q : What was the situation when you placed an order for nuclear plant project in Baraka, UAE in 2009?A : In 2009, we had to place an order for UAE nuclear plant. At that time, the UAE nuclear plant project was almost transferred to France. But Lee Myung-bak, former president has been in the Middle East experts doing lots of construction site. It was possible when I asked for cooperation with the UAE Crown Prince's tax office. Q : How did you persuade the UAE? A : South Korea has shown it is ' all in ' to the UAE. Prime Minister Han and several other ministers went all-out, bringing in all influential figures. If the UAE hands over nuclear plant projects, it will make them all Korean. "" Lee Myung-bak, former president arrived the afternoon of Dec. 26, 2009 Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi, capital (uae) Mohammed and was greeted by of the prince. [Yonhap] Q : Why was a military agreement necessary during a nuclear plant order?A : The UAE has asked what South Korea can do to improve UAE security. The UAE has a lot of money and lots of land, but its population is only 6 million so it is always uneasy about its security. So they want to keep foreign armies in their home country.(An official with the contract said, "" The nuclear plant and military agreement were package deals. We can not make an order to build nuclear plants without a military agreement, the official said.Q : What are the specific requirements of the UAE?A : Korean troops came to UAE when there were military difficulties. Usually, they helped the UAE troops with training or managed weapons. UAE Crown Prince Muhammad bin Zayed al-Na haya asked for troop dispatch after watching a demonstration by Korean special forces. Q : Unlike nuclear power plants, military cooperation is a sensitive area among countries.A : We calculated that it was in mutual interest. So they made an agreement. UAE is a country that has not had a war for a long time. It was judged that the danger situation is not likely to occur and if it occurs, it could respond flexibly depending on the relationship with North Korea. Education and training by Korean soldiers at facilities provided by the UAE is also very helpful. Sending troops is not necessarily because of military threats. I felt that I could send troops if it would benefit the interests of the two countries. That is why the U.S. troops are sent there. However, the National Assembly strongly opposed the plan and persuaded it to be difficult.The motion to send troops to the UAE has been passed by the ruling party alone in the National Assembly on December 8, 2010, and the first segment of the Ark unit must be sent to the UAE on January 11, 2011.A : Let's see. The country is planning to become a brother-like country. In this regard, he promised to help the UAE in case of difficulties. If the situation arises in which Korean troops should be sent to the UAE, however, it can not be done without the National Assembly's consent. Q : So did you make a pact without parliamentary ratification?A : I've been thinking a lot about the National Assembly's ratification. The biggest problem is that if they take them to the National Assembly and find a problem, all their efforts will be ruined. That's why I took the responsibility and decided to make it into an agreement (without parliamentary ratification). "" I thought that if the actual problems arose, I could get parliamentary approval. It may seem like a problem at the moment, but in 2009, he made the best choice for the nation. It was only a closed-door move to build a close relationship with the UAE. Q : There is also speculation that the U.S. Forces in Korea was later enraged because South Korea made a secret military alliance with the UAE.A : That's not true at all. At that time, I had a weekly breakfast with commander Walter Sharp, the commander of the U.S. Forces in Korea, and I never heard anything like that. Friction rub on a connection to suddenly went to the Moon Jae-in government : q uae Why did you have?A : I didn't even know Defense Minister Song Young-moo went to the UAE last November. I later learned about it by watching the Minister of Defense's short story. If you had called me once, I would have explained the relationship between Korea and UAE. Perhaps he misunderstood the closed-door military agreement while reviewing past documents to clear away the evil. It seems that the UAE did what it would not have had to do if the U.S. armed forces carefully checked the North. When (Song) asked to change his promise in the UAE, the UAE royal family might have said, "" I will break off all ties with you because I feel proud of you. ""(Former Minister Kim and Minister Song have worked together in Youngdong, so they are close to each other.Kaldun Khalifa Al Mubarak, Arab administrator of Abu Dhabi leaves the National Assembly Thursday afternoon to pay a courtesy call on the National Assembly speaker. Q : What will the Korea- UAE relationship be like?A : It is important not to break ties with the UAE now. The presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae and the government are conducting their own training. So, I have been saving my words so far so as not to aggravate the problem. Even if the political faction is different from the administration, national interests are in the national interest. After Kaldun Khalifa Al Mubarak, an aide to the UAE's ruling Workers ` Party, and Abu Dhabi's chief of state, the head of the executive affairs office may have to sign a more radical agreement with the UAE. Even so, there is nothing to lose. Song Seung-hwan Joongang.co.crt, reporter for song.seunghwan.co.crew."

And especially on the basis of actual events, we're starting to get a lot of attention on the characters in the movies, the people who are out there, the people who have to hide, but the people that we've been hiding in the real world, we've got to focus on. Torture technician Lee Keun-an, Lee Keun-an is said to have been followed by Kim Jung-hun. Kim Jeong-hoon, reporter, and consultant technician Lee Geun-an?Mr Kim Jung-hun > Yes. But before you find Lee Keun-an, I think you should meet him first. Would you like to hear it?"" I'm sure it was lethal in terms of circumstance. "" Your Excellency was very concerned about that. "" When one of the investigators slapped a desk, the famous investigator slapped down on the desk, and …? "" "" Kim Hyun-jung, ""The movie is called ` Posters of 1987 ` (Photo : CJ Entertainment, Supplied) `. It was written as Kim Jeong-hun, who explained how Park Jong-cheol passed away while investigating the loss of the airplane. But the person who actually told reporters that was Kang Min-chang, then director of the police department.◇ Prior to the establishment of the police station, Kim Hyeon-jung said, "" There was a security headquarters, and the head of the security office used to say, ' I have died with a bang, "" in his mouth.Mr Kim Jung-hun > Yes. But as it appears in the film, the general manager who tortured pro-democracy activists or masterminded a series of activities to manipulate investigation results was played by Kim Yoon-seok, head of the National Defense Agency. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > The director of the movie, Kim Yoon-seok, played by using a North Korean accent.Kim Jeong-hoon > Actually Park Cheo-won was born in Jinnampo, Pyeongan-do in 1929. After liberation, he defected to Vietnam and became a police officer in 1947. Since then, he has served in the high ranking department, and the espionage agents say he is a symbolic man. Let's hear what historian Han Hong-gu, a professor at Sungkonghoe University.Professor Han Hong-koo : Park Cheo-won is a second-level security officer without a police chief or a police chief. He's got hundreds of spies, thousands, and so on. But a lot of what they say they caught after the ' 70s was probably fabrications. "" "" I mean, that's what you said, Kim Hyun-jung > Gong-Hae.Mr Kim Jung-hun > Yes. And that's how they formed the so-called Park Cheorwon Division, which is a group of police who did the same thing. Park Jong-cheol, a military adviser and a lethal adviser, turned out to be the case. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > The person we are looking for today is consultant Lee Keun-an, who is also a member of the division? ^ Kim Jung-hun > Yes. But the relationship between Park and Lee was not just about as good as that between her boss and her subordinates. In short, it was an alter ego. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : How much do I get without talking to each other?Kim Jeong-hoon > Lee Keun-an entered the police force in 1970 as a policeman, reportedly playing the role of bodyguard for then Grand Public Affairs Director Park Cheo-won. Park helped me later in my career with the government service, and the relationship continues for the rest of my life.◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Isn't it because you were cited as the former adviser to former Congressman Kim Geun-tae that this new proposal was made to us?◆ Achieving national team manager Kim Jong-hun > say that we've got in 1985, when Kim Geun-tae, Lee Geun Ahn were brought in when investigated by police was then chairman of mincheongnyeon bakcheowon. Park Chire-won, head of the security team, ordered Lee Keun-an to be tortured, saying, ' I think you should take charge of this when Kim isn't talking. ' Former lawmaker Kim Geun-tae recalled the experience of torture during his lifetime. Let me hear it. The adviser to the late Democratic United Party, Kim Geun-tae (photo = data photo). [Recording : late Rep. Kim Geun-tae] : Sometimes very strong. With long and short steps It gives you pain and fear, but you don't want to lose any ... "" ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > ' strongly increased electric current. It was a torture technique within Lee Geun almost so painful but not deadly. It was Park Cheol-won who was involved.Mr Kim Jung-hoon : Still, it is a long time before Lee Keun-sin was revealed. Kim filed a complaint in January 1986 against the perpetrators of the torture, but didn't even use the name Lee Keun-an for his confession.◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > did file an accusation anyway.Although investigation was conducted after receiving a written notice of indictment by Kim Jeong-hoon >, the case was cleared after one year. There are allegations of torture, but no evidence of torture. The prosecution concluded on January 6, 1987 that the charges were groundless. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Park Jong-cheol is about to die as a consultant?It is only eight days before Kim Jung-hoon. What if the investigation was done right? Listen to what Moon Yong-sik, a member of the current 4th Industrial Revolution Committee, who was tortured by the loss of Korea's air space in Namyeong-dong with Kim.[Recording : Moon Yong-sik] "" It's a team, a team from Namyeong-dong investigation team. Park Jong-cheol's team eventually tortured Kim Geun-tae. Rep. Kim Geun-tae, chairman of strictly to accept investigation when he had punished and bakjjongcheol torture case is not happening. Whoever found out the truth about the torture, it was the fault of the prosecution to clear the bill. The prosecutor killed Park Jong-cheol. "" ◇ Selections from former Rep. If we investigated it properly, it would mean that Park would not have been tortured to death if he had not been acquitted.The case of Kim Jeong-hoon and Kim's torture became the subject of a reinvestigation in the wake of the murder by Park Jong-cheol, which was adopted by the National Assembly in 1988 as the ruling Grand National Party's ruling party's ruling against the ruling party. Then, a year later, the name Lee Keun-an appears in the world. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Are you on the jury?^ Kim Jung-hun > No. And that's when he started his 11-year journey. Park Cheo-won is ordering the escape again. Park Cheol-won, the commissioner of the security office, called Lee Keun-an to escape on December 24, 1988, when Lee Keun-an was sued. Let's take this part as part of a presentation on the results of a subsequent investigation by the prosecution. [Recording : The November 1999 Public Prosecutor's Office announced] "" You shouldn't be involved, so you should avoid it. First of all, you should avoid it. You were told, "" And then you were asked to "" take good care of your family and then "" and then ◇ up front. The regime will protect you.

Park Chire-won gave a direct instruction. Lee Keun-an ran away like that, wasn't Park Cheo-won's security guards punished in the Park Jong-cheol murder?(Photo : Data photo) Mr. Can I give you a moment to tell you the sentence? "" "" The accused did not seek honor or power when he was in the police service, but rather committed to the great cause of justice, and the guilty verdict alone dealt a fatal blow to his own record. ""◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > A lot of torture and manipulation, these things were credited to you for being honored?Did you know what happened to Park Cheo-won, the security manager who was released? It was the support of torture police, including Lee Keun-an. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Lee Keun-an helped while he was hiding, and Park Cheo-won, Chian-an, head of the police?Kim Jeong-hun > Chief Information Officer Park took one billion won from a casino operator and handed some to Lee and other police advisers. This was revealed when Lee Keun-an turned himself in in 1999. Shouldn't Park Chire-won, then, be punished again for escaping?◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : Of course. Wasn't it?Although Kim Jeong-hoon > Park was indicted without physical detention, he will be released again on probation for ' old age and diabetes '. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > No, you mean the person who ordered torture to kill a person and helped escape from the consultant and was never properly punished?I really wanted to hear Park's stance on the issue, but as a result of the interview, he passed away due to old circumstances 10 years ago. So, we found someone to tell a story for him.◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Lee Keun-an is the subject of this talk. Have you looked for Lee Keun-an?Lee Keun-an, like Kim Jeong-hoon > Park Cheol-won's alter ego, was not only regarded as an act of torture, but also as the only one who was considered to have been able to tell the whole face of torture at the time Last week, I found the address of Lee Keun-an and visited the residential area of Dongdaemun Gu in Seoul. Let's listen first.[Recording : Lee Geun-an] ["" I wanted to ask you, "" Hello, can I ask you if you can interview me for a moment? "" "" I don't have interviews. "" "" I didn't want to ask you why don't you call me ... ""Lee Keun-an, who lives in the basement of a shabby Dasedae home, encountered reporters with his underwear. He was once nicknamed "" Bear, "" but now he looks just like an old, bloated man in his 80s.

"Never went back (photo : Park Yoon-hyuk, an intern reporter). I looked again the next day. He still declined to be interviewed, but he left the following story. Listen. [Recording : Lee Geun-an] ["" About 30 years ago. I don't remember who you are, and I don't want to kill everyone involved, and I don't want to be the only one who gets to talk to them about it. "" "" I don't want to say I'm happy now when I'm out of here. Kim Jung-hoon : Isn't it a form of apology and reflection? Lee Geun-an told the media on and off, "" I would do the same thing back then, "" "" In those days, patriotism was patriotism can not be delayed in someone else's face. "" ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > It is a nuances that is unfair now.I do not think that it has changed much from that point.◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I think this is my first time. He heard Lee Keun-an's voice. I turned around 30 years later. We've looked at the movements of 1987 and beyond. It is shocking to think that the offenders who committed the crime at the time are still innocent and do not apologize or regret. I think the struggle for democracy in 1987 might still be progressive. Journalist Kim Jung-hoon, don't stop here today and prepare more follow-up reports. Let's hear it out. Thank you for your efforts. The frozen pond that hit the United States on the frozen continent is now seen as a crocodile that has turned ' frozen. 'Recently, Charlotte River Swimming Park, located in Ocean Island Beach, North Carolina, released photos of the frozen crocodile on Facebook with the pond.In the public photo, the crocodile froze, sticking out of the pond. The suffering of crocodiles is of course affected by the recent cold wave hitting the U.S. continent, but another interesting secret is hidden in the picture.Surprisingly, the crocodile is not verbal but alive. "" I don't believe it, but the crocodile in the picture is still alive and well, "" Park said, explaining that when the pond froze in freezing weather, it looked like it was frozen dead. "" When it gets warm again, the crocodile controls its body temperature as if nothing had happened, "" he added.This behavior of the crocodile is hibernation. As is well known, some mammals, including bears, hibernate after being stuffed to the full during the fall. The same is true of reptiles, which is a poikilothermal whose body temperature changes depending on its ambient temperature unlike mammals. But while bears hibernate lightly, crocodiles spend the winter almost died until the weather warms up.

Unification Minister Cho Myung-kyoon told South Korea's chief negotiator, "" If the weather is not always the same as the weather, it's not an exaggeration to say that the North Korean economy is frozen and the North Korean economy continues to be very cold. "" "" Since ancient times, when the people and the general public were united, it was a heavy-seeking summit between the two Koreas, "" he said.

"You need to lie down on the ceiling and adjust the symmetry to get prone to prone position, to catch the symptoms of esophageal regurgitant on the neck, and in the winter, to lie down on the left. Melatonin, a sleep inducing hormone, increases its secretion during the night. The most important thing when sleeping for long hours is ' good posture '. Sleep experts say that it is the right attitude to lie down on the ceiling without a particular illness. Professor Joo Eun-yeon of the neuroscience department at Samsung Medical Center said, "" It is easy to think that sleeping in a comfortable position is the best way to go, but sleeping in the wrong posture can be difficult, "" adding, "" keeping one attitude during sleep can be detrimental to your health. ""◇ prone position, high pressure on the neck, and considered the worst sleeping position among spinal cord injury sleep experts, prone position negatively affects the entire body. First of all, prone position increases risk of glaucoma, which increases the pressure of the eye. An eye specialist at an ancient Angae Hospital analyzed 17 men and women who were in their beds by changing their intraocular pressure. As a result, the intraocular pressure in the eyes when lying down on a ceiling was 16.2 ㎜, and when lying down, it rose to 19.4 ㎜ PML. If you prone to lie down, your head and neck are under more pressure than when you look at the ceiling, therefore, it makes the intraocular pressure higher. A prone position is also a venom for the spine and neck joints. Sleeping on a stomach can cause neck, ligament, or spine, to go awry, when the hips and backbone are bent toward the ceiling. Also, pimples can easily be formed when you sleep on a pillow where bacteria reproduce by sweating or dandruff.▽ Photo : Shin Ji-ho, health Chosun journalist, graphic = Kim Hyeon-ji should look at the ceiling, lie down, and symmetry, and the spine can support the body and absorb external shocks. The spine curve must be maintained for the correct sleeping posture. First, straighten your back, neck, and spine, and stretch your arms and legs to form a 45 degree arc or groin gap. At this time, keep your hands facing toward the ceiling so that you do not get entangled in your shoulders. A small cushion at the back of the knee helps the joints, from the spine to the hips or legs, to keep the curve straight.Pay attention to the pillow and mattress selection. If the pillow is too high or too low, the cervical vertebrae can tip over, resulting in blood circulation and strained muscles. A pillow height of 4 to 6 cm for an adult male and 3 cm for an adult female are appropriate. Nishino SeijI, director of the sleep rhythm lab at Stanford University, said, "" You need to be able to make the mattress move flexibly to fit the body. "" He said, "" The stronger you are, the stronger you are. ""◇ If you have a medical condition, it is recommended to sleep with a posture that helps prevent deterioration of a disease.▷ If you have otolithiasis, sleep with your ears facing the ceiling. Professor Shim Dae-bo of Myongji Hospital said, "" This is a condition in which otolaryngolaryngosis, the right balance of the body, enters the semicircular canals where the body rotates, "" adding, the otolithiasis branch faces downward. In fact, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association analyzed the effects of sleeping posture on the recurrence of otolithiasis in patients with otolithiasis. As a result, only six of the 62 patients who adjusted their sleep positions experienced a recurrence of otolithiasis. Meanwhile, 11 of the 57 patients who did not correct their sleeping postures experienced a recurrence of diatomitosis, among whom five were also re-occurred following a second treatment.▷ Lie on the left side of the stomach and esophageal reflex disorder. Professor Lee Sang-kil of Severance Hospital said, "" If the stomach is positioned farther to the left than the esophagus, the lower part of the stomach might move downward, and the stomach acid can move downward. "" In fact, a study published in the American Journal of Photochemistry found that people who sleep on their right side have a backflow rate of 3.8 times per hour. Compared to the number of times the group of glasses who lie to the left, 0.9, it is an extremely high number.▷ Rather than a spinal stenosis and lumbar disc, sleep with your feet on the side instead of on the straight. If you are lying down on your side, you are likely to bend because it helps ease the pain. A slight bending at the waist will help loosen the strained spinal cord nerves, said Kim Ho-jung, an orthopedist at Seoul National University Hospital in Bundang. In case of spinal canal stenosis, pillows or cushions are placed between the knees, and the space of the vertebral canal can be larger, which reduces pain.If you have a spinal disease, such as antegonizing spondylitis, it is best for you to lie down on the ceiling. Because anchening spondylitis is a condition that binds the bones in the waist, one should always keep one's spine and joints in good shape to avoid deformation. Professor Kim Ho-jung said, It is better for mattresses to be rather firm than soft enough to hold the waist.[Lee Hyun-jung, Chosun Ilbo reporter] [Go to Doosang.com] [Chosun Ilbo Subscription] - Cooprights Daily & Chosun.com, No reproduction"
"○ Reduced annual salary of 3 million won under contract with basic paid weapons, including bonuses for businesses, bakery, retail store, and al-Alive store management of gas station. As there are many small business owners who can provide wage increases, it is expected that they will pay less and less impact on the minimum wage this year The photo shows a self - gas station in Seoul. [Yonhap] Small and medium sized company D & cosmetic company changed its basic wage items to avoid the burden of a minimum wage hike. The company decided to include 50,000 won and 100,000 won per month from the monthly self-development fee of 150,000 won. Kang (31), an employee of the company, said, It is apparent that the government is trying to replace the amount with the money it already gave me to increase, but there is no way to respond. As the burden on employers due to minimum wage hikes increases, the burden is often passed on to workers or avoid the possibility of such measures. Hagwon A in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province stopped having dinner for Arvites since this month. The academy provided a daily lunch for Arvites who work from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. with a market price of 7,000 won. However, when labor costs rose, he sent out a notice to settle dinner at his own expense. `` It was more of a dinner charge than a raise. The minimum wage increase is a decline in my salary, he said. Kang (23), who works as a contract weapon clerk at a trading company in Seoul, saw a reduction in bonuses. The company has been proactively notifying that it will reduce bonuses from 400 percent per year to 200 percent and include the remaining 200 percent in the base. Bonus is an expenditure without a legal obligation. It is hard for workers to raise a problem as long as they observe the minimum wage levels enforced by the law. Due to the bonus adjustment, Kang will receive nearly 3 million won less in annual salary. Kang said, It is frustrating that the wage increase policy is supposed to cause wages to fall, but it is no help at all. In the apartment management sector, the minimum wage increase is causing a "" moral hazard. "" One apartment in Gangdong-gu, Seoul, will raise its monthly salary to 2.1 million won from the previous 1.8 million won, taking into consideration the minimum hourly wage increase that started this month. However, it was finally set at 1.18 million won after the residents ' meeting. The government will provide 130,000 won per capita in job security to businesses that employ workers with a monthly wage of 1.9 million won or less, to receive the funds. Since the increased minimum wage exceeds 1.9 million won, the company decided to shorten the hours it works by increasing the time it takes to rest on the job. In the bakery industry, there are places where a reversal of duty occurred between the president and a part-timer. One of the Paris Baguette stores in Gyeonggi-do has been learning to bake bread since last December. To save on the payroll for bakers. As the retail store owners focus on baking bread all day in the kitchen, part-time employees are responsible for handling the most important customers and managing the store's overall management. The store owner said, It is worried that it would be difficult for a part-timer to manage the store with the same sense of responsibility as the store owners, but the number of customers would decrease. Even businessmen have a lot to say. Shin (47), who runs an architectural firm in Gangdong-gu, Seoul, said, I don`t know if it is a lucrative business, but if it is the only business that makes a small profit, it would have a dramatic increase in sales costs. In other words, it means that the government is trying to pass the money on to the poor as a means to survive. ▽ Graphic : Kim Young-oak yesok@joongang.co.kr] Experts find out the reasons for various side effects and expediency in poor government roles. Due to the nature of the minimum wage policy, there is no "" Government contribution, "" and that is why the market is opposed. Economic experts at Yonsei University said, Sung Tae-yoon, a professor of economics at the university, "" The wage hikes policy is something that someone pays for and is nothing more than a fee paid for. "" If income should be redistributed with enough money to cover the income, the minimum wage system would have taken the money from the underpriviled classes and given it to the underprivileged, he said. The answer is to raise the minimum wage quietly but steadily, as it has become a political issue, users should be spooked, cut down on their jobs and start to react to it, said Yoon Hee-sook, a professor at KDI. Regarding the introduction of minimum wage and reaction from the market, he pointed out the process of designing policies that should be taught. Economics professor Cho Joon-mo at Sungkyunkwan University said, We have started the discussion on minimum wage at the time with all candidates making pledges, and the process of making it necessary to draw up a political agenda has begun. He explained, "" Objectification of the political process is to determine the range of impressions (Range) that both employers and employees would like based on precise data on statistics on the labor market and impact analysis. "" He explained, "" If the collective intelligence leadership of experts is not reflected, politicians can not control the temptation to take a radical look, as if they are overpressing the mycin.

"The first film, "" The Downfall of Iran, "" told us how majestic the PahlavI dynasty was before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Now I want to talk about the PahlavI family that is still alive in the United States and how they affect their home country, Iran. We start the second royal and royal series of The New World News, ' even though it's not true. Queen of Wales : 100 million dollars. In 1986, former Crown Prince Reza PahlavI of Iran and a wedding of Jasmine. Left was founded by his mother, former Islamic Queen, Farah Falavi. At the time, the eldest son of King Muhammad Reza PahlavI was a pilot in the United States. The following year, when she died in Egypt, the 21-year-old Prince Reza PahlavI succeeded to a token royal blessing. But he didn't call himself king. Under the Iranian constitution laws that were enacted in 1906, the heir to the throne must be sworn in by Iranian parliament. Reza PahlavI's mother is Farah Diva, the king's third wife. She was the hero of a magnificent coronation ceremony in 1967 when she was given the title of empress of Iran, wearing a crown with 1,541 jewels in it. Although he was kicked out of Iran, he must have been taking a lot of money abroad. According to reports by Forbes in 2016, the property of Farah PahlavI in the United States was estimated at about $ 100 million. I want to take a look at Muhammad Reza PahlavI, who is sworn in by the Senate in Tehran on February 16, 1950. [Video] Queen Elizabeth II : Venus in Asia. Palabi first married Egypt's Princess Poujia in 1939, when she was Crown Prince. Palabi was 20 and Faujia, 18 (some say she was 16), and Princess Pausia was so beautiful that she was called the second Cleopatra. Even the royal marriage would have been a political one for the Crown Prince PahlavI to refuse. The wedding was once held in Cairo and once in Tehran. Princess Muhammad Reza PahlavI of Egypt and the first wife of king of Iran, Poujia, was such a beauty that she was called the reincarnation of Cleopatra ' Venus of Asia. ' She was the first queen of the second PahlavI dynasty, Muhammad Reza PahlavI, in Washington in September 21 when she was called the owner of Fa wzia Fuad. Two years later, in 1941, Palabi was forced to follow in the footsteps of her estranged vice-principal, and became Shah of Iran. The following year, the American magazine Life printed Queen Paujia on its cover of September 21, 1942, calling her the "" Venus of Asia. "" There was also a compliment on the over-shaped face and piercing blue eyes. But the wedding didn't last long. After the birth of daughter Shanaza, Pauja filed for divorce in Egypt after leaving Tehran in 1945. As the divorce was established in November 1948, Pauja returned to the Egyptian princess, and remarried the following year to an Egyptian colonel. The second wife of European Queen PahlavI was given a divorce compensation in 1951 under the name of King Muhammad Reza PahlavI (right) and his first queen, Queen Paulzia. Soraya first met Palabi in 1948 at the age of 16 and Palabi proposed to him by giving him a diamond ring that would reach 22.37 carats. Their wedding was also gorgeous. Queen Soraya wore a dress with feathers and pearls designed by Christian Diore. In 1951, King Muhammad Reza PahlavI of Malaysia married his second wife, Soraya. Queen Soraya wore a wedding gown with feathers and pearls designed by Christian Dior. [Photo Wikipedia] Mohamed Reza PahlavI (right) and his second wife Sora. Soraya, regarded as the most beloved woman by King PahlavI, unfortunately never had a baby. The king, who was in a hurry to succeed to the throne, eventually announced his second divorce in 1958. The king was also considered to have a second wife to give birth to a son, but Soraya opted to step down. As a divorce settlement, Paris's high-end penthouse, a $ 3 million luxury Rolls Royce and Benz cars, jewelry and an annuity of $ 7,000 per month. Soraya lived in Paris and spent the latter part of her life as an actress, starring in several movies. Farah Diva, who became the third wife of an exile in the United States before and after the Henry revolution, gave her two princes and two princes to her red-fathered king. The title of empress in 1967 was also attributed to Dasan, which is believed to have been used. But as I mentioned earlier, the youngest daughter, Raila, died of an overdose after being kicked out into the revolution, and her second son, Ali Reza, died of a deadly weapon. It was the tragic fall of the Iranian royal family, who once had the highest wealth and honor. King Muhammad Reza PahlavI crowns Queen FahlavI at his coronation in 1967, when he crowned Queen Faradiva as empress. The crown with 1,541 jewels was specially crafted at the request of the royal palace by world-renowned brand Van Cleef Appel. [Photo Wikipedia] But Paradiva and her eldest son Reza PahlavI are still very well lived in exile in the United States. Their staunch supporters are immigrants who fled the country before and after the Iranian revolution. Some estimates put the Iranian diaspora at about 600,000 in LA alone. Hey...11 minutes by surprise. The CIA planned a new wave of pirates in Iran in September 1986. The 11-minute video showed Prince Reza PahlavI living in the United States saying, "" I will go home. "" It was later discovered that the CIA planned this event, which shocked the Iranian government and its people. There are also revelations that the CIA backed the Iranian royal exile in the 1980s. Reza PahlavI She is the living successor of the PahlavI dynasty, which was ousted by the 1979 Islamic revolution. Born in 1960 to the eldest son of King Muhammad Reza PahlavI, he now lives in the United States. Prince of Wales has dismissed the claim as "" groundless. "" He called it "" patriotic "" supporters to be able to live in America without a decent job. Pahlavi an interview in The Crown Prince was Donald Trump as president, “Revolution in Iran is to get up.” “I would like to go back to Iran.” has the aspiration.He even showed. In Iran, however, people often watch TV the lives of Queen Paradiva or Crown Prince Reza PahlavI in the U.S. Not state-run broadcasting controlled by the central government, but satellite broadcasting from abroad. There are dozens of satellite channels broadcast outside of Iran, including Fars TV, BBC Persian, and PARSI. These channels are available at home with satellite receivers that were heavily regulated by the old masters and the young, but now they're out of control, and they're basically referring to the Iranian channel. In addition, the show is showing the one-and-a-half generation Korean singers in Los Angeles, as well as the once-talenter stars who were popular during the monarchy. It's a curious thing for the older generation who remember those days, to get homesick, and for the younger generation trapped in the religious framework. MBC historical drama ' Jewel in the Palace, ' set during the Jongjong period in the Joseon Dynasty, has caused a stir in Iran. You know that the drama "" Jewel in the Palace, "" starring Lee Young-ae, was a record-breaking hit in Iran. When broadcast on Iran's state-run IRC in 2006, it reported unofficial viewing rate was over 80 percent. But in some ways, it is the satellite media that made hallyu possible in Iran. As Hollywood or American drama spread through satellite channels, Iranian state-run media played Korean dramas to keep in check. As a result, Jumong, thank you, the Emperor of the Sea, and Dongyi, along with Daejanggeum, hit the jackpot. It is also important to note that Iran imported mostly historical dramas or family dramas to suit the conservative tastes of its authorities. When anti-government and anti-professional protests took place in Iran recently, the first thing the government did was to block Telegram, a messager app. They were trying to share protest information via telegram and stop critical public opinion from converging. More than a week of protests are ending with 21 deaths and more than 1,000 being detained, but it is premature to conclude. Because of the fact that the world's most wired young people, known as the third generation (Naslebom), are becoming the driving force of change in Iran. Students protested and complained when police sealed off students who took part in anti-government protests at the University of Tehran on December 30 last year."

The government holds a festival that gives gifts and financial support to young people who turn 20 that year. It is in contrast with Korea, which holds small events at several universities. Since it is a national holiday and is an adult ceremony led by a local government, young people who attend the ceremony prepare it from as early as one year ago.

This kimono, which is worn only during the ceremony, is as expensive as the fancy. From the minimum 210,000 yen (two million won) to the high one million yen (940,000 won). In addition, they need white scarves, bags, and other tools with large intestines that are worn around their necks, and even cost a lot of money for cosmetics. Because of this, Japanese youth often joked that they would be selected as the pillar root after the ceremony.

"▽ How do you get to Muan International Airport? = As it is still connected to the roads, accessibility is not poor, citizens in the southern part of the country said, "" We need to get to the airport in order to have easy transportation. Three flight attendants were drinking beverage at the convenience store on the first floor, while the owner kept the restaurant on the second. 960 seats in the waiting room on the first or second floor were empty. The airline counter was deserted.◇ Unification with Gwangju Airport First, '' which was created in November 2007, the airport has become the center of controversy recently. The government decided to put Muan in the Honam Express Railway (KTX) line with an additional one trillion won, leaving aside the integration with the previously discussed airport. Shortly after the announcement, criticism was raised over the Honam area's "" 1 trillion won cardiopulmonary resuscitation "". As a result of its overlap, it is generally pointed out that it is difficult to normalize the airport even if one trillion won is invested without first integration with the Gwangju Airport, where passengers are divided.According to the ministry`s plan, the second-stage Honam Line (from Gwangju to Mokpo) is bent with the letter "" C "" to go through Muan airport. The ministry will confirm a revised route map for the first half of this year. It is scheduled to open in 2025 and costs 2.4731 trillion won. It costs 1.13 trillion won more than the Strategy and Finance Ministry's (Strategy and Finance) plan to utilize existing routes for the high-speed project, which costs 1.3427 trillion won. Vehicles have stopped in front of the deserted Muan International Airport in South Jeolla Province (left) on July 3. At the departure counter at Muan Airport, 63 percent of the passengers were checked in (right) in for the first time. / reporter Kim Young-keun's "" via the KTX bound in Muan, "" has been at the forefront of keen interest for more than a decade. Muan, originally established as an alternative airport to Mokpo Airport in Yeongam, South Jeolla Province, was the nation's No.1 airport with the highest rate of cancellation. The unsafe Mokpo airport was hit hard by the closure in 1993 when 66 passengers were killed in an aircraft crash. Muan International Airport was Kim Dae-jung government in 1999 government pushed for projects such as construction. It plans to build the airport into a hub in the southwestern region by absorbing both domestic and international flights. Construction began in December 1999 and opened in November 2007. The project cost 306.6 billion won.However, due to the resistance from Gwangju, only international flights from Gwangju Airport were relocated to Muan Airport at the time of the opening. It has become a half-priced airport. Domestic flights at Gwangju Airport remained the same during the first stage of the Honam Express Railway (Yongsan, Seoul - Osong, and Songjeong in Gwangju) launch in April 2015. As a result, many local governments argued that the precondition for reviving Muan is its integration with Gwangju Airport. Some were delighted to see the KTX plan, saying, A trillion won will draw about six times more people than the railroads. Choi Yong-ho, vice director of the regional operations team at Muan, the state-run airport corporation, said, It will make a significant contribution in boosting the airport and creating momentum for regional growth. If the KTX is built, more people will use the airport and the airport will go into orbit.On the other hand, some say it is clear that the routes will be designed for political purposes and therefore throw away only 1 trillion won in taxes, and that it is typical of giving away the budget.◇ The opponents of the airport route adjustment connected to 600 billion expressways point out that the airport is already connected to the road. The Muang-ju Expressway, which was opened in May 2008 and connects Gwangju and Muan in half an hour, is also connected to the West Coast Expressway. He drove from Lotte Mart in Gwangsan-gu to Muan Airport in the afternoon of that day. It took 40 minutes to travel the 53.8 kilometers at the speed specified. It took 22 minutes to go to Songjeong Station in Gwangju, which is 14.1 kilometers away from Muan Airport. Taking the check-in and travel time into consideration later, it would take longer to use KTX. Office worker Roh Soo-cheol (42, Bongseon-dong, Gwangju) said, We don`t think there are enough Gwangju people who will go to the airport by KTX, adding, Will the demand for Incheon and Gimpo Airport come to Muan?At Muan Airport, an average of two domestic flights to Jeju and three international flights are scheduled daily. The only regular international flight in Beijing was discontinued last October. Ten international flights are the only ones available in six countries, including Japan and Vietnam. All are charter. Other than during the flight, the airport is as quiet as death. As of 2016, the airport has only 6.3 percent utilization.

It is a huge amount of money that the average worker has to work for several hundred years to touch, but he or she does not have to pay any tax. There is no reason to tax on virtual currency gains. The government is preparing to impose a full range of taxes on virtual currency transactions, but is taking a cautious approach in that the tax is seen as a "" virtual currency decentralization, "" which could stimulate speculation. According to the government ministries, the Strategy and Finance Ministry formed a task force with private experts to discuss taxing virtual currencies. TF is reviewing corporate and income tax, value-added tax, and transaction taxes as possible taxes on virtual currency transactions. In theory, corporate tax is taxable immediately. Since corporate taxes employ the umbrella principle, any nature of virtual currencies can be taxed if they are earned by transactions. The corporate tax law follows the principle of imposing net asset certificates on people who see the total amount of asset growth minus the total amount of asset decline as income, said an official at the National Tax Service, referring to an increase in income from virtual currency transactions. But it is theoretical to the end. Because it is not easy to secure a tax source unless the company voluntarily reports the business in such an uncertain situation. In case of income tax paid by individuals, the law must be revised in the National Assembly before taxation can be made. Income from the Bit-Coin transaction will be classified as transfer as income from the transfer is not the comprehensive or retired income listed under the Income Tax Act. Transfer income can be taxed only as listed in the law. Income earned from land and land sales rights, superficies, power of inheritance, major shareholders ’ equity, business goodwill, memberships, and derivatives trades. The government has yet to find a basis for taxation when it made clear that it is not a financial transaction for virtual currency transactions. In case of VAT, it can be determined whether or not the tax is taxed by interpretation only without amendment to the Act. For game money, although it is not virtual currency, the Supreme Court's precedent set that it is equivalent to the ` commodity ` under the Value Added Tax Act, and that selling game money is equivalent to the ` supply ` of goods. However, it is also cautious to impose the excise tax on virtual currency in the world, as it is also being exempt from taxation. Some worry that imposing a similar transaction tax on securities transactions could add to speculation. Last year, the Chicago Board of Trade (CME), the world's largest futures exchange, raised the overall price of a virtual currency by saying that it would enter the market as an official investment commodity like gold, oil, and money. When the government proposed virtual currency measures under the Office for Government Policy Coordination on July 12, Bitcone and others soared, and news of the government's tax push also played a role. In response, the government made it clear that the taxation itself is not a decontrol. Tax professor Kim Byung-il at Kangnam University explained in a telephone interview that since the illegal income, including bribes, can be taxed, the imposition of taxes and transfer of control is on a different level. The most urgent task for imposing taxes on virtual currencies is to regulate its clear character. The government made it clear that virtual currencies are not legal ones, but it has not made clear. Lee Kwang-sang, an economist at the Korea Institute of Finance, said, We have yet to enact a law on virtual currencies and the government can not but be cautious about defining the nature of virtual currencies to affect the overall financial market.

"Kim Se-yeon, the GNP's immediate candidate for the party committee, and Nam Kyung-pil, the ruling Grand National Party's non-unification of the party, announced on July 9. Lee Han-seung, a member of the ruling Grand National Party's Democratic Party's main opposition Democratic Party, and Lee Shin-young announced later whether to defect. In addition, Gyeonggi Province Governor Nam Kyung-pil, who belongs to the right party, said, "" I will not join the ranks of the people's party and party. "" However, Nam is known to be taking a back seat on the right-of-way party defection and on the party's double party. I will return to the Korea Party after I hear the voice of my fellow members of the local council who have worked with me in any difficulty in the region, Kim said in a statement. Kim went on to say, I don`t have any mixed feelings with many people and party members who love the right party, especially with the remaining colleagues, and especially with the young people who have set their minds to it. Wherever I stand, I will do my best to help build a Republic of Korea for the next generation, he stressed. Kim immediately submitted the bill to the right party and will file a petition with the Korea Party later this day. Governor Nam also wrote on Facebook yesterday, I will not participate in the merger of the right parties and parties. This is because we can`t be together on the other side of the road, the official said. For the sake of conservatism and the future of the nation, we need to go to the center and achieve a ` grand unity `, he said, begging people to join forces. I hope we can meet again on the road to greater unity. Nam declined to comment on the issue of leaving the right party and the main opposition Democratic Party's Party. It is known that the governor will decide whether to leave the party while watching the right party and the people's party discuss the merger. Regarding this, Nam told Yonhap news, We are now considering whether to leave the party. Meanwhile, when Kim announced his departure from the right party, the number of party members who once won 33 seats decreased to 10. In addition, one or two lawmakers, including Rep. Lee said, "" I couldn't contact her all day long, following the previous day. Under these circumstances, the forecast is that the additional defection of the right party would negatively affect the unity of the people's party and the decision of the two parties would not work as a decisive factor that would shake the unity itself. jesus7864@yna.co.kr [Contributions and enquiries] There are familiar ' illegalities in the daily lives ' all over society. The reality is that the authorities virtually let it go so people can not feel guilty while committing an offence. The fight against massive structural evils as well as the efforts to improve the ' ill effects ' of life is a major challenge to raise the standard of our society. The government should devise proper enforcement measures or change the legal system to fit the reality.A company employee distributes illegal leaflets to customers in Mugyo-dong, Seoul (left) on July 5. Most of the leaflets distributed on the streets are not stamped with the permission of the district office. ▽ Photo = On July 5, lunch time came to Seoul Mugyo-dong, journalist Jeong Han-gyeol and journalist Cho Moon-hee. The number of office workers is busy handing out leaflets from various outlets. After watching the news report for an hour, reporters found that no single leaflet with the stamp of the district in charge was printed.I didn`t know if it is illegal to distribute leaflets, said an employee at a health club who was distributing leaflets. A nearby office worker, Chang (39), also said, I don`t know if it was illegal to receive leaflets, but even if it was illegal to give them to others, I would not be able to answer them.The one who sprinkles or receives does not know whether it is illegal. As you can see, the number of acts of distributing and attaching leaflets everywhere is so numerous that it is virtually impossible to control them. Local governments and police, which are subject to the crackdown, can not afford to crack down on them on them all. However, it is not uncommon for leaflets containing harmful ads for teenagers to be inspected on a regular basis.Lee Yang-seop, head of the advertisements at the Seoul Metropolitan Government, said, It is difficult to crack down on other ads, even though there is a special team involved in such obviously illegal advertisements as prostitution and lending.There are two main types of regulations on paper ads (leaflets). Flyers distributed on the road must be reported to the district office and distributed with the seal, according to the Outdoor Advertisements Act. Posters can only be attached to designated bulletin boards. Flyers distributed inside apartment complexes are managed by management offices and, if distributed illegally, are subject to unauthorised attachment of advertising material for misdemeanors.In most cases, they are simply administrative guidance even when they are called or cracked down. Most advertising agencies are worried that stopping ads as small business owners will have an influence on their livelihood.(photo left) A building in Sinchon, Seoul, has a notice saying, "" Don't put illegal leaflets in front of your door. "" Extra-classified leaflets posted on street pole poles are also illegal. ▽ Photo = The distribution of house streets, in which residents and related officials are relatively aware of the irregularities of journalists Jeong Han-gyeol and Cho Moon-hee, will not lead to strong punishment.I don`t know if you can stop the suspicious people at the door and put the leaflets on your door, said Bae (64), an apartment guard who battles with the leaflet every day.Unlike street leaflets, apartments and parking lots that are inserted or attached in underground parking lots are subject to punishment by the distribution and attachment body, not the advertisers. Even citizens who were irritated over what Arviete is doing, tend to be more compassionate about the punishment. Some say that the government should remove the regulation in name only, but scrapping regulations is not the answer. They should consider legitimate advertisements, fairness, and the safety of passers-by. That is why it regulates the distribution of unauthorized leaflets and posting of bills abroad. On the scene, some say that it is unrealistic to go to the district office every time and have one's hands stamped. Another problem is the short validity of the permission period, which is around 15 days. Kim (39), who works on the leaflet distribution business, said, I have to go to the district office and get all my seals stamped to be sprinkled legally, and said it is not an easy task to distribute the flyer 365 days. They say that they should consider ways to ease their worries and embrace each other into legal circles. In addition, the report of ordinary citizens and changes in the social atmosphere are needed. Seoul City introduced a ' recovery package ' in November 2015. The collection compensation system, which gives a certain amount of money to illegal banners and posters to citizens who have collected, is spreading nationwide in addition to Seoul. Lee Yang-seop, head of the team, said, "" Private participation is needed to eradicate illegal leaflets. "" "" As of the end of October last year, approximately 18 million illegally collected bills and banners were reported, and the municipal budget will remain at 562 million won. "" The city government also plans to show promotional images on illegal advertisements on subways sometime this year.What are you reading now?"

""Subway Line 5-8 suffered similar trials and errors in 2015 when performing full face of the ' toilet without waste paper '. According to the Seoul Transportation Corporation, the number of times the toilet bowl was blocked in 2014 was 3,722 in subway lines, but the number increased to 4889 in 2015 when waste paper was removed.The number of toilet closures decreased to 3521 in 2016, one year after the enforcement of the system, returning to the same level as when the waste basket was placed on the floor. A subway history official pointed out that, "" It was fully foreseeable that the toilet would be clogged if the waste paper was cleaned, but I don`t seem to prepare myself for this time either. "" Kwon Eun-bi (27), an office worker in Mapo-gu, also said, "" There are no trash cans. There are still lots of trash, and there are still people who litter "" and "" I think why do this? ""Give up toilet paper to toilet paper. It is simple to see why a toilet room without a trash can caused a backflow. That's because citizens ' put something ' in their toilet instead of ' trash can. ' "" Waste paper "" is not the main cause of toilet blockage, experts say. Domestic toilet paper certified by the Korean Industrial Standards (KS) has already passed the National Institute of Technology's standard for water release. Industry experts explain that toilet paper for commercial use usually runs out within 20 seconds.The problem is a variety of foreign bodies. Kim (60), who is in charge of cleaning the City Hall station, said, "" Most restrooms are clogged with waste paper, but most toilets are clogged with bricks. "" However, men's restrooms are blocked by various types of household waste.Unlike toilet paper, traveling tissues, portable tissues, and wipes are not water-released and are blocked when put into the toilet paper. Even with the same tissue, paper towels or wipes won't get stuck in the toilet, said Kim Young-il, director of Yuhan Kimberley. Kim Nam-jo, a tourism professor at Hanyang University in Seoul, also said, "" The restrooms are said to have ' used paper towels in the toilet ', but it is necessary to make clear which type of toilet paper is allowed to be put into. ""The Ministry of Health believes that keeping the trash can separately in the restrooms is not a good idea for sanitation management, as the temporary side effects of the system's settlement are "" taking time to adapt to the bathroom without it. "" Only Korea, China, and some Latin American countries worldwide drop waste paper used in restrooms in their trash bags.In the United States, Japan has no waste basket cases in the public restrooms. You are going to have to throw your toilet paper away. Women's restrooms are equipped with storage containers that can be discarded separately, including sanitary pads.Some say that the system is a temporary side effect of early implementation. Pyo Hye-ryeong, director general of the Cultural Citizens ` Coalition for Laundromat Restroom, said, "" It took more time for citizens to adjust to the bathroom. As the daily intake of coffee increased, the diagnosis rate of intestinal metaplasia increased.Infection is when inflammation in the stomach occurs and the stomach's mucous membrane changes like the intestinal membrane due to repeated recovery.According to KOFRUM on July 9, Professor Yoon and his team visited the home medicine room of the Graduate School of Medicine at Kyungpook National University and had their stomach endoscopy for 88,000 patients during the 2013 examination. The study's results (a link between coffee intake and intestinal metaplasia in Korea) were published in a recent issue of the Journal of Korean Family Medicine.The team diagnosed the stomach endoscopy as intestinal metaplasia if the stomach mucous membrane is uniformly discolored to white spots or white.Studies show that the percentage of coffee drinkers in the day is highest at about 62 percent. 17.7 percent of people drink coffee three to four times a day. The percentage of people who did not drink even one drink a day and people who drank more than four drinks a day were 12.1 percent and 10.1 percent, respectively.An estimated 20.2 percent of coffee drinkers experienced a long-term diagnosis rate of their lives. Compared to the diagnosis rate of intestinal metaplasia of people who do not drink coffee at all, the rate was 10 times higher.The study found that the higher the daily intake of coffee, the higher the rate of intestinal metaplasia. Compared to people who did not drink a cup of coffee in a day, those who did not drink 3 or 4 cups of coffee had an intestinal metabolism rate of 4.1 to 9.5 times each. The rate of intestinal metaplasia in people who consistently drink more than 4 cups of coffee a day was about 13.9 times higher than that of people who never had any coffee.Despite the difference in degree, both instant and filtered coffee consumption increased the rate of intestinal metaplasia. Compared to non-caffeinated people, the rate of intestinal metaplasia diagnosis was 12.8 times per day when drinking more than 4 cups of instant coffee. Drinking 4 or more cups of filtered coffee other than instant, however, had a diagnosis rate of intestinal metaplasia that was 16.6 times higher.It is widely known that the caffeine contained in coffee could affect gastrointestinal conditions such as gastric ulcers and reflux esophagitis by boosting gastric acid secretion, Yoon's team noted in the paper."" It was also found that the risk of intestinal infectio increased with increased daily coffee intake, regardless of the type of coffee. ""Meanwhile, according to a Korean study, the adult diagnosis rate for intestinal metaplasia was 42.5 percent for men and 32.7 percent for women."

There have been several cases in which minutes of a meeting have not been made, and some documents have been disposed of without a list, raising suspicions of being destroyed illegally. The National Archives and Records Administration of the Ministry of Public Administration and Security announced on July 9 that it reported the results of an inspection of major policies with high national preservation value and of records related to large-scale national projects to the cabinet meeting. The National Archives Service did not check the status of major records such as projects with large budgets, four-river restoration, resource diplomacy, and the accident in Sewol, and even confirmed the production and management records of the 12 institutions whose records were made last year First of all, major policies related to the four-river project and overseas resource development were found to have no minutes to make or store the deliberation agendas on personal computers.Busan Regional Construction and Management Administration did not make the minutes of its meeting after holding a committee meeting in June 2009 to change its comprehensive river water quality plan along the Nakdonggang River. The Korea Gas Corporation did not produce minutes of meetings from 1-14 times to 18-21 even though it held a risk committee on overseas resource development projects. The Korea National Oil Corporation submitted the contents of its acquisition of the Habest Canada to the Risk Management Committee in October 2009, but did not keep a record of the issues discussed at the time. The National Archives Service decided on a ‘ Foreign Oil Company Asset Receptions Plan ’ as of October 8, 2009, but did not change or re-registered the acquisition target and the amount to be acquired on the same month 26. The acquisition was then worth $ 2.85 billion, or $ 4.47 billion. Other cases were revealed that the original document was lost, left unattended or even destroyed illegally due to the incorrect registration and management of records. The Korea Water Resources Corporation's overseas business division is suspected of illegally destroying paper documents by removing them from its waste list when relocating from Gwacheon to Daejeon in December 2016.Director of the National Archives and Records Service Kim Seung-doo (Yonhap news agency) revealed Tuesday the results of a major national preservation project at the National Archives and Records Service. Korea Resources Corporation held its own Risk Management Committee 69 times between 2006 and 2013, but lost the original copy of the 15-page meeting. As the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport removed the ‘ Four Major Rivers Restoration Headquarters ’ organization in April 2013, it overrode six-box paper records, including drawings and secret documents, without listing them and overreached them. The documents were left in storage by the department.In addition to the records of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's ‘ Four Major Rivers Development Promotion Headquarters ’ left unattended at the warehouse, the Korea Research Institute of Land, Infrastructure and Research and Management issued a report on the comprehensive implementation plan of the ‘ Four Major Rivers ’ in 2010. It was also revealed that the preservation period of major state-related materials, including the four-river refurbishment projects, has been decreased to three to ten years. The Korea Water Resources Corp., the provincial headquarters of the Korea Water Resources Corp., was found to have kept records of major projects such as the four-river restoration project or its strong-attached hydroelectric project for three to ten years. The Korea Rural Community Corp. has also set down the retention period of the ` Four Major Rivers Project Inspection Council ` (measures to be finalized in late April), a document on the four-river restoration project, and a report on the ` Four Major Rivers Project Plan ` (which was adopted by the Rural Community). Poor records management also led to work related to the Sewol accident. The Sewol Memorial Support Committee for the Cabinet Office created tasks such as ' National Assembly affairs ' or ' clerical work in western Seoul ' without creating a task related to the organization's unique ' Supporting the Victims of Sewol Line. ' The record has also been set at three to five years. The National Archives Service will ask related agencies to correct the probe and ask regulators to audit. tsl@yna.co.kr"

"" This morning we were limited in our pricing, excluding some Korean exchanges, "" the U.S.-based Coin Market cap said on Twitter on Tuesday (local time), adding, "" This is a sharp departure from the rest of the country. "" Coin Market Cap aggregates 1,186 virtual currency including Bitcone on a UTC (UTC) basis, and Thumb Bank of Korea is excluded from the list of Korea's three largest exchanges. The move is believed to have resulted from the fact that the price of virtual currency is significantly higher than the international market price due to the Korean investment frenzy. Greg Deware of Vitmex, the virtual currency derivatives exchange, told Reuters, "" In Korea, all virtual currency prices are down by 30 %, so it looks like the premium is down, "" adding, "" Otherwise, the market capitalization of virtual currency is down by 30 %. In fact, Bloomberg's international bid for Bitcone dropped 15 percent to 13,900 dollars at midnight Korean time on July 9, down from the previous day's high. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) analyzed that the fact that the Korean government announced stricter regulations against the virtual currency exchange also affected the actions of the coin basket caps. Coin Market Cap spokesperson told WSJ the move was carried out because of the excessive price gap. As a result, the price of ripple, the second largest virtual currency in the city after Bitcone, dropped 26 percent in one day, and the price of beatcore cache decreased by 18 percent and 12 percent, the WSJ reported. Among the top 40 virtual currencies, the price of the coins fell by 31, including the beat coins and the dollar. In addition, the market capitalization of Ripple decreased to $ 970 billion, ranking third among virtual currencies and this amount ($ 148 billion) was returned to second. Bitcone, or $ 25,000 billion, remained the overwhelming No.1. The WSJ quoted the coin basket cap as saying that the market capitalization of the virtual currency had evaporated by 100 billion dollars over the past 24 hours. The total amount was $ 8,350 billion on July 7, but it once dropped to $ 68.3 billion on July 8 and then recovered to $ 722 billion on August 8. newglass@yna.co.kr. Report and inquiry ▶ Conversations with the reporter are currently being held at the "" Peace House "" on the sidelines of the Pyeongchang Summit on July 9. The meeting will be held on the sidelines of the inter-Korean talks on the inter-Korean border, not at the Pyongyang City Hall, and then the Olympic Committee on Friday. Some had even predicted that it would be held at 10:30 a.m. due to the North`s insistence. This is because North Korea uses Pyongyang City 30 minutes later than South Korea's standard time. However, as the talks are being held at the Peace House, North Korea is believed to have decided to follow the South Korean Standard Time.Unification Minister Cho Myung-kyoon will hold a tea-time meeting with delegates at the South-North Dialogue Center in Samcheong-dong, Seoul on July 9 to conduct a final check on strategies. Then, they will leave for the Peace House at the truce village of Panmunjeom, which is the conference point at 7:30 a.m. It is about 75km to Panmunjeom and is one hour's drive.The North Korean delegation is scheduled to cross the Military Demarcation Line at around 9.30pm. before the start of the talks. During previous talks, high-level North Korean officials often went directly to the peace house in a car provided by South Korea behind Panmungak, a North Korean facility at Panmunjeom. But this time, the North Korean delegation decided to walk through the MDL to the peaceful home, the ministry said.The South Korean delegation will shake hands with the North Korean delegation in the lobby on the first floor of the House of Peace and then go up to the second floor of the talks. When the delegates from both sides sit down, the head of the delegation speaks. Usually talk about the weather or talk about the truth. That's all it takes to get the media to know. Both sides are also conscious of the media by exchanging "" boneless "" or verbal words.Real talks started after reporters left the venue. Unlike diplomatic negotiations that start with working-level officials, which often depend on the delegates ' ability to hold talks and to come back, the two sides are in a tense battle of nerves. A ministry official said, We can quote the two leaders based on their keynote speech. The two sides will be able to guess the overall atmosphere and the difference between their views. North Korea`s chief negotiator, Park Young-soo, also said of the Seoul flames during the inter-Korean talks held at the Peace House in March 1994.All of the talks ' remarks will be transmitted in real time to the commands of both sides. Peace House has the advantage of our home turf. Through the CCTVs at the conference centers, Cheong Wa Dae and the South-North Dialogue Center can even check the expressions of conference delegates.After the morning meeting, the two Koreas have their own lunch. In the successive meetings, the two Koreas have never eaten together. The North Korean delegation does not leave the House of Peace, but eats in a different room from ours. Meals are usually provided by the Organiser. We usually prepare a quick buffet or lunchbox for our catering service.After lunch, the schedule will be discussed through the liaison officer at Panmunjeom. Whether to hold another round of afternoon meetings, have dinner, and continue the night meeting depends on the situation, the official said. Some close to the Unification Ministry forecast, It is highly likely that the talks will end relatively quickly as North Korea has reached an agreement on its participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. The two sides are expected to discuss the details of their agenda at a follow-up working-level meeting.  "

We agreed that the meeting would trigger the restoration of the inter-Korean relationship with the South and North at a time when inter-Korean ties are strained and frozen, Chun said. Both sides are expected to discuss specific measures at the meeting and future working-level talks based on such consultations.

"" We have just made a closed-door move to build a close relationship and trust with the UAE, he said.Among the contents of the pact, the automatic intervention of Korean troops in case of an UAE case is somewhat controversial. However, the Korea Party, which raised its profile last week by referring to the parliamentary investigation, is also likely to lower its voice and seek an exit strategy. In this regard, it is doubtful whether the continuing offensive against the GNP would have considered a possible backlash from the GNP.Kaldun and Lim will also announce the results of their consultations at a luncheon and are expected to make a "" good signature "" on how to improve their friendship.We will let the public know on the day whether the official diplomatic schedule of the two countries can suggest how the improvement of friendship could be possible, said a presidential official.However, it is necessary to keep an eye on the situation for the time being after Kaldun's departure from Korea. Some members of the ruling Grand National Party (GNP) could ask for a parliamentary committee to conduct parliamentary investigations or call for a parliamentary committee to be called upon, depending on the response of the presidential office.With the possibility of Kaldun openly mentioning sensitive diplomatic issues, whether they are powerful or not, suspicions are that only the two countries could be asked to upgrade their ties. Kaldun, who arrived the day before yesterday, is expected to leave the country at 0.30 a.m. on July 10. The North American International Auto Show, one of the four major motor shows in the world, will host the world`s largest information technology exhibition in Las Vegas in early January before it takes place in Detroit, the home of the U.S. car. As the convergence of automotive and IT is growing faster, including autonomous driving, connectivity, and IoT, many complete car parts and components makers have been visiting CES for the past few years to introduce future mobility technologies. Major companies are focusing on CES, so the Detroit Motor Show in mid-January is getting little attention. At CES 2018 in Las Vegas, Nevada, on July 9, more than 10 major carmakers including Hyundai and Kia Motors, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen, Nissan and Ford emerged as part of their production efforts. In addition to the evolution of autonomous driving technologies introduced at CES in recent years, eco-friendly vehicles such as hydrogen fuel cells (FCEV, hydrogen electric vehicle) and electric cars (EVs) have been introduced. The technology to control the vehicle was even revealed through the recognition of brain waves. Toyota's open Autonomous Car Platform e-Palel focuses on new technologies that have IT built on them, but an event that attracts global attention has resulted in the mass production of cars, not to mention the motor show. First, Hyundai Motors decided to name the next generation hydrogen electric car NEXO and released its data and key technologies, including actual vehicles and incisions, at the exhibition hall. Nekso is equipped with what is called the ultimate environmental hydrogen fuel cell system and ADAS, the latest driver support system based on counter-propelled driving technology, and achieved a distance of more than 590 kilometers with a five-minute charge. Hyundai Motor plans to use Nekso as its top priority in its joint technology development project with Auroras, an autonomous running company. Kia Motors Corp. unveiled its concept model of pre-production of its electric sports utility vehicle, called SUV Niro, to be launched in the second half of the year at CES. A simple, intuitive interior with integrated exterior features and optimized for autonomous driving, including the smart touch steering wheel (steering wheel) was noted. Founded by Tesla, Nissan and BMW executives, Chinese electric car startup FutureMobility introduced the electric car brand Byton and also unveiled an electric concept SUV. A large display 1250 × 20 cm was mounted at the front, and hand gestures were used to manipulate the vehicle's functions. Link data technology from China has also introduced the U-bikes, a small urban electric car weighing only 180 kilograms. It can carry two people on a 920 ㎜ bodyshell and run 100 kilometers on a single charge. In addition, the U.S. Genovation-based company unveiled its Chevrolet Colbett battery electric car, GXE, at CES for the first time in the world. The GXE Corbet is an electric car with an electric motor, instead of an internal combustion engine, and is known to have a maximum output of 800 horsepower through two electric motors. Nissan also exposed its new electric car, which was released last year, to CES after announcing brain-to-bile technologies that interpret signals from the drivers ` brains. Autonomous cars were also fully introduced at CES this year. Toyota first unveiled its latest self-driving test vehicle equipped with LIDAR, radar and optical cameras. The vehicle is characterized by four long-range Rhida sensors that enable it to recognize objects up to 200 meters away from the vehicle. Various sensors were placed on the roof and reduced the volume and height, thus minimizing the difference in appearance from other production vehicles. ZF received live coverage of test runs conducted by Autonomous Test Car Named Dreamcara near German R&D Center during CES by sending test runs data to the CES showroom booth 9200 kilometers away. Aptive and car-sharing service provider Lift launched "" Autonomous Driving "" services in downtown Las Vegas and Autoliv, Swedish independent driver development company, openly tested its own learning car, and released a 2.0. With the opening of next generation infotainment system, Benz has revealed to the U.S. market the Autonomous Driving Concept Car Smart Vision, EQUIP, which was unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show last year.Las Vegas = Copyright.com, a reporter for Culture.com namdol@munhwa.com["

"" In New Hampshire, there is also a way for the trust fund to receive the prize money in return so that the winner can not be identified.

Last year was a time of growing concern because of North Korea`s missile and nuclear tests, CNN reported. North Korea and the United States exchanged the war-sensitive rhetoric, but 2018 began with a glimmer of optimism that is rare on the Korean Peninsula. Adam Mount, senior researcher at the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), a military non-profit organization (NGOs) in Washington, said, "" High-level talks between the two Koreas are also vital for U.S. interests.

The WSJ quoted Unification Minister Cho Myung-kyoon as saying, "" The main agenda of the upcoming inter-Korean summit will be North Korea's participation in the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, but the South Korean government is likely to discuss other possible military issues involving separated families and the Korean Peninsula. "" North Korea has yet to publicly announce any compensation for its participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. However, the WSJ reported that it is likely to ask for postponement or abolition of the Korea-U.S. military training. Despite signs of sea ice, many security experts are unlikely to make a new breakthrough from the June 9 inter-Korean high-level talks, the WSJ forecast. However, Joel Whitz, a senior researcher at the Johns Hopkins University Research Center, predicted that the high-level talks between the two Koreas could serve as an important opportunity to open up a new avenue. In order to do so, the government needs to take softer measures, such as avoiding personal attacks on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and easing travel restrictions on North Korean diplomats at U.N. headquarters.

"▽ Housing land price regulation is enforced if necessary … It is not reviewed at the time of the reconstruction, '' said Yoon Jong-seok, a reporter at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport in Seoul. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced last year that it would secure 40 new public land sites around the metropolitan area by the end of this year to provide prospective honeymooners with their own land. Park Seon-ho, head of the Housing and Land Ministry, told the ministry at a meeting on July 9, Although housing prices have become unstable in some areas, he will recover stability if the real estate measures implemented after last year are implemented. In relation to this, the new DTI loan regulations will be enforced at the end of this month, and the transfer tax for multiple residents will be enforced in April. Park cited three reasons why he expects housing prices to stabilize this year. Government measures, such as the 8-2 Real Estate Measures and the Housing Welfare Roadmap, are expected to have a full effect, and the housing market is expected to experience a rise in interest rates at the end of the era of the lower wages. To further expand the supply of housing in the Seoul metropolitan area, Park said, "" We will select 31 candidate sites for public housing this year, and among them, we will select the best districts in Seoul. "" The ministry said earlier that it would designate 40 new public land sites in its roadmap for housing welfare, while nine other areas, including the Seongnam Geumto district, Bokjeong district and Guri Galmae subway station, announced their candidate sites. We can provide honeymoon town, public rental, and public rental housing, as well as sell land to private homes for private sale, Park said on the new land. In addition to new land, he stressed that the Seoul Metropolitan area will be flooded with housing."" Apartments in the Seoul metropolitan area are expected to grow by 55 % this year, "" said Park, who also heads the Transportation Ministry in Seoul, adding that apartments are expected to grow by 30 % or more than 40 %. Regarding the overheated housing prices in southern Seoul earlier, Deputy Strategy and Finance Minister Lee Chan-woo said, There appears to be speculative demand for the reconstruction of the four districts. Park responded, It is not for the purpose of purchasing a real estate fund, but for the purpose of checking real estate financing plans in some areas, although it is difficult to tell the difference between speculative and real demand. Regarding speculation that the reconstruction period could be increased from 30 to 40 years, Park said, We have not considered it for now. Regarding the application of the cap on housing prices for private apartments, I have not changed my original stance that it would be necessary to apply it when needed. Park also referred to the housing market as being superstitious. "" I think I have a belief that buying a house in Gangnam will make a lot of money, "" he said. "" Actually, house prices have risen only 170 times since the beginning of 2000, but it is now the same period of 3.3. "" We detected 72,000 people who disturbed market order such as illegal sales after the 8-2 measure, Park said, adding, "" We will crack down on them by imposing strict enforcement measures against them this month. ▶ banana@yna.co.kr article 1:1 ▶ In the latest trends and report and your reporter his chief of president and Im Jong-suk kaldun Khalifa Al Mubarak (uae) United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi.The head of the administrative relations between the two countries agreed to develop into a comprehensive and sweeping strategic partnership.

"▽ MoneyToday Kim : The Ministry of Land, Real Estate and Illegal Transactions Control announced last year. Among them, 293 who were confirmed to have falsely reported the actual purchase price of their products, such as their contract for business or down payment, were fined.The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced on July 9 that it has imposed fines on 2,465 suspected real estate violations and filed complaints against the National Tax Service (NTS) in the wake of its ongoing monitoring and on-site inspections as a follow-up measure to deal with the 8-2 scandal.The real estate transaction research team, which comprises the Ministry of Land, the police, the National Tax Service and local governments, conducted a focused study in areas with high house prices. Among the cases reported to the real estate transaction reporting system, most likely cases of illegal acts were cases of housing sales reported to the real estate transaction system, such as housing sales higher than KRW 900 million or lower, short-term transactions or multiple transactions under the age of a home.The investigation used a ' Financing Plan ' to determine misconduct. The reports on the fund procurement plan, which was implemented on September 26, 2006 according to the August 2 Countermeasures, requires that a purchaser make a "" housing acquisition fund and move in plan "" to purchase 300 million won or more homes in overheated areas.Research team prepares and prepares data on the actual transaction details of the deposit for 1,191 cases or 4058 people who are suspected of falsely reporting the actual purchase price (contract) or giving illegal gifts to others, and prepares details of payment before or after payment.As a result of the review, the details of explanation were insufficient or the contract for the deposit operation (reporting higher than actual purchase price) was carried out in a contract (reporting lower than actual purchase price), and the broker's suspicions about illegal sales transaction rights were also donated by illegal or commission.The court finally imposed fines on 167 people who were confirmed to have sold the product falsely. The National Tax Service reported 141 cases of illegal gifts and omission of transfer income tax. For minor cases, such as lack of paperwork, administrative guidance was conducted.The ministry believes the mandatory reports on the financing plan could do some good in preventing real estate illegalities. The Ministry of Land reported that the ratio of illegal acts was likely to be from Gangnam 4 (Gangnam, Seocho, Songpa and Gangdong) to Ganggye-dong from July 26. However, a majority of low-price transactions were reported from last year to September 30. However, the specific transaction was carried out by a short-term investor who was required to carry out.Extensive research was conducted into the business and down contract. After the 8-2 measures were implemented through monitoring of the real estate transaction management system (RTMS), 22,285 cases and 72,614 people were found to have been suspected of being up and down contract worldwide. The ministry will notify the local governments to conduct a thorough investigation. Among the suspicions, 809 persons suspected of missing out on capital gains taxes reported it to the National Tax Service separately.The Seoul Metropolitan Residential Development district and Busan, along with other newly built apartments, have coordinated with the police to crack down on illegal sales. The 1136 people suspected of illegally selling or winning prizes or illegally obtained contract materials from construction companies were asked to investigate by the National Police Agency.The ministry plans to continue monitoring the market and on-site inspections until the property market stabilizes. An official at the ministry said, "" If the special judicial police system is implemented that enables government officials to exercise their right to investigate real estate transactions, it will increase the possibility of emergency arrest, and the execution of arrest warrants will be possible. ""What you see next door is a list of articles that you get for free cartoons and gifts. There were also a series of cases in which he threw off his job and jumped in. We made billions by investing tens of thousands of won in a bit coin, the statement said, turning them into bit-coined zombie. A virtual coin market is lit in front of the Korea Exchange (KOMSUNG) in Jung-gu, Seoul. As the price of Bitcone dropped 41 percent in a day on July 22, but surged 21.5 percent on July 23, many people are saying that people should be cautious about investing in the market. Park Yoon-seul, a journalist at Yoon-seul, said, "" The reason for this trend is structural problems in our society. Being in desperate need of a job, you can't afford to buy an apartment with the money you've saved all your life, or risk losing a gold spoon or a coin that you'll never beat, you know, the ones in your 20s or 30s, aren't going to make it.As the economic polarization is growing, some say that virtual money investment is the last channel for class transformation. A (30) who got ready to work started investing in virtual currency last year, and has been studying it for a while. Rather than sticking to the job market, which has failed many times, he or she is thinking of getting out of the job market by investing virtual currency. On July 9, A said, "" It is difficult for an average office worker to get a house in Seoul after saving a penny for 10 years, so it would not change his gloomy future. ""Government regulations are not acceptable either. The current law does not have any basis for taxation, so the tax amount is 0 won even if you earn tens of billions of won. There are moves to introduce protection such as transaction real-name system, but financial authorities ' attempt to pull the virtual currency market into the regulatory framework appears to add to the turbulence. In addition, the fact that he made billions by investing in virtual currency has fueled the development of virtual currency.B, a 30-something office worker who started investing in virtual currency at the end of last year, often checks his smartphone while on duty. We were told that her co-worker made a lot of money with her virtual bills, turned the car into a big car, and even raised money to buy an apartment in Gangnam. Friends nearby are also making money from millions to tens of millions of won, said the official, I think this is the only time we can change lives.Recently, an online community posted an article on the Internet saying it earned 54 billion won from its virtual currency investment along with a capture photograph. The Internet user wrote one after another, saying, "" If I write a story down, I will send one million won each to 10 people. "" The account number was then followed by hundreds of comments asking to be shared, "" I live in a semi-basement hotel, "" and "" I have requested my own recovery. "" It is a ' hilarious ' (funny and sad) scene produced by the virtual money frenzy.Non-named miscellaneous causes are constantly being promoted in collective chat rooms and Internet message boards designed to exchange information on virtual currency investment. Though the coins were not listed on the Korea Exchange, the temptation to invest only a small amount of money in Lotto is needed. It is very possible that it could fall or disappear in an instant, and it could become the target of fraudulent crimes.No Jin-cheol, a sociology professor at Kyungpook National University said, As the younger generation is familiar with the Internet, they are enjoying virtual currency transactions like games without any resistance, they are not going to be swayed by any changes in their beliefs. As there are many side effects, such as causing obstacles to everyday life, regulatory measures should be set up, he added.Lee Jeong-su : Set the channel and challenge New Year's gifts!"
"Lee Do-yeon, a reporter at the cosmetic store, was found to have excessive bacterial and staphylococcal bacteria.

The Korea Consumer Agency said Monday that it investigated the cosmetics products of 42 testers (16 eye shadows, 10 mascara, and 16 lip service products) in 16 cosmetics shops in volatile areas with former wives in the Food and Drug Administration. Tester products are samples placed at the store for consumers to try before purchasing a product. More than 14 out of 42 cosmetics brands (3.1.3 %) were found to have exceeded the standard value of microorganisms. Although the tester products were released, the new products were not released due to the lack of microorganism standards, and therefore, they were not released. Four of the 16 lip service products (25.0 %) had total aerobic bacteria (bacteria) that were below the standard value of 1000, with an excess of 13.3 - 2.14 million cf9 %, and three (18.8 %) that were found to be staph free.Tester-lister MicrobiologyProduct [Provided to consumers] Total aerobic bioproduct count is a measurement of living bacteria and fungi and is therefore subject to an immune infection when germs and fungi can be used or when contaminated cosmetics are used. Staphylococcus aureus is a germ that can cause very common infections in the human body (skin diseases, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, and nausea). Two of the 16 eye shadows (12.5 %) also had more aerobic bacteria detected than the reference (500 or less) by 510 - 2,300 cf u, and one appeared to have Staphylococcus aureus. Five of the 10 mascara products (50.0 %) yielded total aerobic bacteria in the production levels of 550 to 2,200 cfg (500 or less). The Consumer Agency said, "" Most containers such as eye shadow, mascara, and lip service are just designed to be opened and used, and the risk of cross-contamination is greater than that of tubes or pumper-type products, so the risk of using the contaminated product is high. "" In fact, most of the test subjects remained open without a lid, and there was no release date.

"" dylee@yna.co.kr and news reports, 1:1 murder by a reporter. The Busan District Court's seven-party criminal judge, Kim Jong-soo, announced on July 9 that he sentenced wool, who was sent to life in jail on suspicion of robbery and murder.Yang (31), who stabbed a woman in the chest with a gunny bag containing the body of a murdered woman 15 years ago, stabbed her and left a coffee shop in Gwaebeop-dong, Sasang-gu, Busan on May 21, 2002 He also draws 2.46 million won from a bank in Sasang-gu, Busan, the next day, and takes out two women's bars from a bank in Busan on June 12. We can not accept the reasonable evidence that Yang did not murder by collecting the purse of a bank account and a seal, but by combining the passwords, prosecutors said. Yang, who brutally murdered the man, denies the crime, has not agreed with the bereaved family, and does not regret it, the court said, accounting for the severe sentence. The trial, which was held on July 8 as a public trial by the accused, was carried out at a late stage, including a court's recognition newspaper, statements, issues, and evidential relations, and the final hearing of the defendant, the jury, and the jury's review process. The jury found seven guilty and two innocent. The sentence was three to death, four to life in jail, and two to five years in jail.The trial issue is whether Yang admitted the murder of a man (witnesses, criminal instruments, and DNA) on suspicion of taking out money from the bank accounts of murder victims. Prosecutors said the statement was based on statements made by Yang Dong-guI, Yang's wife who carried the body in a gunny bag, blood on her car seat, her character, murder motive, and several previous convictions about her involvement in criminal murder. The defense said, The indirect evidence provided by the prosecution is mostly evidence of non-murder-related murder charges, and Yang was not able to convince of his innocence, as it is not supported by laws, logic or scientific laws. The case, which is close to being buried in the U.S., began its investigation into the criminal suit law in 2015, which was amended to eliminate the statute of limitations on all murder cases, and the 15 year report of the police. wink@yna.co.kr Kim Yong-beom, vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission, made the request at a meeting of the Financial Stability Commission (FSB) in Basel, Switzerland on July 8 (local time). The FSB is an international organization composed of heads of eight international organizations including the 30 member institutions (financial authorities and central banks) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Kim Yong-beom, vice chairman of the Financial Services and Virtual Monetary Inspection Committee, was quoted as saying at the meeting on July 28, "" As the risks of virtual currency increases, financial authorities need to pay attention to this fact. "" In particular, he stated, "" Virtual money, which previously existed outside the traditional regulatory domain of financial authorities, has affected traditional financial systems and consumers, "" adding, "" Virtual money is too dangerous to ignore. "" Citing the use of cross-border cyber transactions to launder illegal acts or money, he stressed the FSB is due to focus on the international debate on virtual currency. Kim argued that FSB should support the response of virtual currency by properly gathering and sharing relevant information, such as the content and effectiveness of regulations related to virtual currency. In addition, during the FSB meeting, the evaluation work on the achievements of the regulatory reform, measures to mitigate risks of the violation, and cyber security and pintech issues were discussed. speed@yna.co.kr"

The research team will be formed into temporary organizations to analyze the effects of virtual call-based technologies such as block chains on monetary policies and payment systems.The central bank held a meeting of its chief executive officer Shin Ho-soon yesterday to discuss virtual currencies and the central bank's digital currency. Eight divisions, including the Financial Supervisory Service, the Financial Services Commission, the Monetary Policy Bureau, the Financial Market Administration, the issuing office, the International Affairs Bureau and the Economic Research Institute, will participate in the TFP.We don`t want to study the issue further because financial authorities are leading regulatory measures such as the illegal trading of virtual currencies, a central bank official said, explaining that TF is mainly based on research on related technologies such as block chains.In addition, the TF will also study the CBDC issues discussed with international organizations at some central banks.The central bank plans to strengthen its response to the virtual currency by setting up a separate organization (tentatively named Virtual Monetary Research Team) within the Financial Supervisory Union (IMF) in late January. We plan to closely examine the impact of the future digital financial reform on the financial economy and share relevant findings with the government and regulators, the BOK said.The move reflects the intention of Lee Joo-yeol, chairman of the ruling Uri Party, according to reports.

Moreover, the possibility of an explosion has increased, making it impossible to guarantee the safety of the missing soldiers.According to AFP on July 9 (local time), "" Since the ship was on fire, it was more likely that the condensate oil would have been burned rather than pumped into the sea. """" But if the tanker sank before the oil ran out, it would be very difficult to clean it up, "" he said with an estimate of "" how much oil has been burned and how much it has been spilled.

We sent a peace ship to prevent a second disaster, China Foreign Ministry said in a weekly news briefing yesterday.The search for the missing crew continues. Chinese authorities say they plan to expand their search and rescue operations by mobilizing 13 search and rescue ships. However, due to the poor sea environment, such as rain, wind, and waves, the sea is reportedly having a hard time searching.The danger of explosion is also an obstacle. Experts are still concerned that strong smoke is still emitted from the collision ships, and that the possibility of an explosion is growing."" There is still a risk of explosion and sinking, and gas poisoning is dangerous, "" a government official explained. "" It is a very dangerous environment even for rescue workers. "" The total fertility rate in 2006 (the number of babies that one woman expects to give birth to during her lifetime) rose slightly from 1.12 to 1.17 in 2016. However, the total number of births during the same period decreased from 448,200 to 426,000. The fertility rate has increased, but the ' paradox ' of birth rates is that the number of births has decreased due to the rapid decline of fertile women (ages 15-49) themselves who are able to have children. This means the government can hardly escape the ' vicious cycle of low birth rates, ' no matter how much it spends. That is why some point out that a fundamental change in the low birth rate is needed.○ Measures to limit the low fertility rate and the backbiting of anti-foreign medicines are expected to decrease rapidly. Born in 1983, Mo-gi (35, female), stated, "" My class was 43 in 2000 when I was in high school. "" "" Five years later, my sister was surprised to hear that we were in the same school. "" Children born in the early 1980s like Do are considered the last baby boomers. Back then, the birth rate was three. When two couples give birth to three children, the population naturally increases. However, by the mid to late 1980s, the birth rate will drop to two. Since then, the number of births has continued to drop, leaving the country at 400,000 as a year since 2002. Born in the early 2000s, high school students aged 16 to 18 had only 28.2 students per class. A sharp decline in the population means a decrease in fertile women. Last year, the Ministry of Health and Welfare's census on fertile women produced 469,974 children, but the number of 15-year-olds dropped sharply to 237,962. It is true that 20 years has passed since the beginning of the Korean War. In particular, the number of fertile women has decreased rapidly since 1982, when the nation was 36, when the nation saw its line collapse by 400,000. Children under 35 are now the major fertility age group that gives birth to 80 percent of all births. Last year, the average age of women who gave birth to their first child was 31.4 years old. Experts say that when the birth age of children in the 1990s is reached, the "" swamps of low fertility rates "" are likely to deepen. National Assembly Research Service Director Park Seon-kwon said in his ' Third Framework Problems on Low and Aged Society and Policy Direction of Improvement ' that "" when the cohort of births in the 1990s is set to enter the stage in earnest (a vicious cycle). ""We should focus on improving the ` fertile woman ` quality of life, said Kim Dong-sik, an economist at the Korea Women's Policy Institute, stressing that the decreasing number of children is already an irreversible phenomenon, boosting the number of fertile people. "" Since the first generation of people who were born in the 1990s who had more years to live than anyone else, we don't need to raise expectations for childcare and education, "" Kim said, "" let us simply give birth to our nations. "" This means that investment in fertile women and policies are needed immediately. The nation has spent more than 100 trillion won over 10 years on childcare, but after spending a lot of money on free childcare and childcare, the two or three years director of senior social studies at Hanyang University said, "" Low birth rates and maternity protection are no longer an obstacle. "" Critics say the government's policy focus on the birth rate and the number of births should also change.

"▽ North Korea's delegation to the Olympic Games and cheering squad (PG) [Production team, Olympic team, athletes team, cheering group, and the Asian Association of Media Workers for the North Korean Olympic Games ' Association for the purpose of sending pictures of participation by North Korea's delegation, observation team, and support team In a keynote speech at the talks, the North showed its intention to send out high-level delegations, athletes, art teams, observers, and reporters. North Korea has sent athletes to the international games in the South before, but the North has adjusted its stance by sending a final round of visits to Pyeongchang, in view of the fact that it has never sent a delegation of artists, observers, or taekwondo officials. First of all, North Korea sent a total of 650 athletes, 362 from the Summer Asian Games in Busan and 288 from the cheering squad. A year later, 527 athletes, 221 athletes and 306 supporters, were dispatched to the Daegu Summer Universiade in 2003. At the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, a total of 273 athletes were sent, and were appointed then chief of the Military Affairs and Political Affairs Bureau Director Hwang Byung-seo and vice chairman of the ruling Grand National Party Choi Ryong-hae, who is currently the late Unification Minister. At the 2005 Incheon Asian Athletics Championships in a single event, North Korea sent 144 people, including 20 athletes and 124 cheering. The cheering squad, in particular, includes Li Shul-ju, now the first lady of North Korea. First of all, the Pyeongchang Olympics is a Winter Olympics in which athletes from winter sports compete in events, and therefore, the team is not expected to be very big. Jang Woong, a member of the North Korean International Olympics Committee, asked for the size of the team to send to Pyeongchang after arriving in Switzerland in consultation with the IOC on July 8 (local time), the IOC member said. We will make an announcement from the IOC. Most analysts say that even if North Korea sends more players besides its pair of figure skates that have been canceled past the deadline, the size of the pair will remain symbolic. In addition, considering that due to the nature of winter sports, it is not possible to cheer for the team outside of ice hockey, short-track skating, or speed skating, it is unlikely that they will be able to pack them on a large scale. Rather, it attracts the attention of art groups and observers. The Moranbong Band, who has earned the reputation as a "" North Korean girl group "" since Kim Jong Un took power, is also expected to make a visit to the South, as the band and the local concert group could also hold a concert together. Then the number is expected to far exceed 100. In addition, the "" observation team, "" which has never been seen before, is also of interest. Vice Unification Minister, who is attending high-level talks as the representative of the talks, said in a briefing, I wrote down such expressions and explained to you what kind of understanding the terms may be different between the two Koreas, so I will confirm it in the afternoon as a representative contact process. However, it is expected that the size of the visit will be small when a high-level delegation is available. Last June, the International Taekwondo Federation (ITF) had a total of 36 visitors. In line with Kim`s New Year message, Kim Yeon-cheol, a professor at Inje University in Seoul, said, We are so active in participating in the Pyeongchang Games that it is highly likely that the biggest ever group of visitors will be deleted and the image of North Korea will be negative. ▶ jyh@yna.co.kr article 1:1 ▶ In the latest trends and report and your reporter, Gyeonggi Province on Thursday afternoon, Toechon-myeon, Gwangju-si, Gyeonggi-do, sharing in the house of ioksseon My grandmother Kang Kyung-hwa, Japanese military sexual slavery victims.Processing Government's position regarding the direction of Japanese military sexual slavery agreement between Korea and Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs, through using the announcement after City Hall reporters and answering questions. © Minister Kang Kyung-hwa, a reporter first ojanghwan news a news and 2018.1.9 tf 23 government to meet victims after the announcement of the final report ""Follow-up will be more"" (= 1 News, Seoul, Korea), yangsaerom a Jung EunjiThe Japanese military sexual slavery agreement between Korea and Japan over nine days in Japan with regard to renegotiate the accord does not require an appearance in the meantime, the Japanese government with budgets are all one billion yen for.

"■ News 1 : Survey by Choi Jin-mo, Designer's Financial Consumer's Union : "" Unattentional subscription rate : 18 %, insurance premium payment, insurance premium, and personal insurance premium : KRW 103,000 is closed down by monthly subscription. It is equivalent to paying insurance premium for 18 percent of the family's income. As per capita insurance premium spending is ranked 6th in the world, the level of spending by insurance premium is excessive consumption, according to the report.The Financial Consumer's Union announced the results of its ' Comparative Study on the Appropriateness of Household Insurance Subscription Research ' on July 9. A study conducted by the Strategy and Finance Ministry and an investigation into the price situation of 1,000 adults, spouses of 1,000 household or household owners nationwide, was surveyed.According to research, Korean households subscribe to an average of 11.8 insurance products and spend 103,400 won per month in insurance fees. It is equivalent to 18 percent of the pre-tax monthly average income of households surveyed (55.7 million won). As of 2016, the per capita insurance premium was the sixth in the world, and the rate of insurance premium was too high for the economy.43 percent of households subscribed for savings rather than insurance guarantees. The original purpose of insurance coverage was to prepare for sudden risks, accidents and deaths, but with the combination of aging and low interest rates, the purpose of the insurance coverage was changed. As insurance is used as a savings account, the monthly average monthly payment amount is higher in order of pension insurance with savings (182,000 won), endowment insurance (179,000 won), and variable insurance (149,000 won). Long-term damages insurance coverage amounted to 72,500 won and actual insurance coverage was 63,000 won.The rate of savings insurance can hardly be seen as a savings function, as shown by the fact that rates on endowment insurance are not much different from the annual rate of 2 percent and about 10 percent of premiums go to business.■ News 1 : Bang Eun-young, herself needed insurance coverage, accounting for only 18.2 percent of households who voluntarily insured themselves. 61 % sign up through personal contacts or architects. In addition, irradiated households are also breaking an average of 1.6 insurance coverage before maturity on an annual basis. One out of four households (26.5 percent) had their insurance policy canceled within five years.The most expensive insurance fee is the most expensive to wake up with 28.2 percent, and because of the need of a change or a large amount of money, they can subscribe to other products and cancel the fee because they do not need it. 40.7 percent of respondents said that the optimal level of monthly insurance premiums is five to ten percent of their income. I think this is appropriate, but I'm actually spending much more than 18 percent. Gumso advised people to be clear of their purpose in buying insurance and to keep in mind that insurance is not a ' savings ' thing. He added, "" We should determine the appropriate level of appropriate insurance premium expenditure against imports and then diet the insurance policies that we subscribe to.

The terminal will be used exclusively by four airlines - Delta Air Lines, Air France and KLM - belonging to Korean Air Co. and the aviation alliance Sky Team. Asiana Airlines and all other airlines use terminal 1 as usual.

The Justice Ministry is keeping mum on detailed plans for possible contingencies on the repatriation process. The Justice Ministry, however, is reportedly planning to send a delegation to New Zealand to work on the repatriation process. Kim is expected to be taken to the eastern police station in Yong-in, Gyeonggi as soon as he arrives at Incheon International Airport on July 11. Regarding this, a police official said, We have nothing to confirm since the repatriation process is not the business of the police. As a rule of thumb, the police are expected to seek an arrest warrant the next day after investigating Kim on his first day of repatriation. As the investigations so far have not failed to prove the suspicions, arrest warrants will be issued on July 13, and the crime scenes in Yongin and Gangwon Province will likely continue to be verified in the following weeks. It is expected that the time of the transfer will be November 19. Kim was murdered by his mother (55), brother B (14) and stepfather C (57) on October 21 last year.Kim, who withdrew 120 million won from his mother's account on the day of the crime, was arrested three days after the crime and escaped to New Zealand with his wife and two daughters who were two years old and seven months old, but was arrested two years ago. After being sentenced to two months in jail in a New Zealand court on July 1, he served all of the sentences for the cases, including the two months he was previously sentenced to, and was sentenced to extradition by criminal courts. After Kim was arrested, his wife, Jung (33), returned home voluntarily with her children on November 1 last year, and is being tried for being involved in a crime involving Kim.A wife identified as Jeong, who was arrested for conspiracy."
