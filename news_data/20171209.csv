As I rescue my son from the ship and the ship and make him healthy, I am afraid I can live and fail as a patient. [Woo Sang-jo] : "" When my three-year-old son asks me to build a house during play at a children's home, he makes two. One is my home, one is my father's home, "" said Professor Moon Jong-hwan (38) of Aju University Hospital's Regional trauma center. Professor Moon is the only chest surgeon at the trauma center. I have no substitute for him, so I am on call 365 days. The time at home is short, so the child thinks the father lives apart. When Professor Moon goes to work, he says, "" I'm going home to my father. "" Oh Cheong-seong (25), a soldier who defected from the North, survived, but the trauma center at Aju University is still operating. There are about 150 patients staying at the center. Director of the Center for National Studies Lee Gook-jong sleeps on the bed of the lab. Other staff members are no different. Lee said earlier in an interview with JoongAng Ilbo, I am patient with my colleagues who work together every day. On the fifth floor of the Center for Trauma Trauma in Aju University, he met "" Descendants of Yi Dynasty. "" It is a professor of Moon Jong-hwan (35. surgical specialist) and Kang Byung-hee (34. surgical specialist). After graduating from medical school at Yonsei University and finishing a surgeon's degree at Seoul National University Hospital, Kwon joined the local trauma center in 2011. Moon graduated from Koshin University Medical School and finished a chest surgeon at Aju University Hospital, and took the same route as Lee in 2014. Kang joined the public health clinic two years ago after finishing his career as a surgeon at the University of Azu Medical School and the University Hospital of Azu Hospital. The trauma center is inundated with a sudden attack of patients 24 hours a day. I was afraid that there would be an unexpected situation or that I could interview people properly, but luckily all three gathered. Why did they choose to go to the bathroom when they chose to take popular subjects such as plastic surgery and dermatology? Professor Moon says, "" It is because I like to save people. "" Kwon says, "" It is good to fly by helicopter to save patients, save lives by operating on them, and take full responsibility for rehabilitation. "" Professor Kang says, "" It is because I can save patients who live or die. "" The "" pleasure "" that magically makes life a living entity who would otherwise die if we did not take action immediately may have led them to the trauma center. Professor Kang is on call seven or eight times a month, just like Mighty surgeon. I work for 36 hours straight from 6 a.m. to 6 a.m. the next day. This is not the end. `` How can I leave the office when the patient is in the hospital room? As I don`t have a doctor, I have to make a decision, so it is hard for me to leave the office. "" I regret living like this. Professor Moon says, Even the wife who is a doctor says, ' Why are you doing such a hard work? ' I feel sorry for my family, but I don't regret it. I don't even think I want to quit. Professor Kwon said, "" I don't know how that sounds, but this is who we like. It's my choice. That's all. What about trauma surgery drove the young doctors crazy. As medical services are subdivided, doctors who see the breast look only at the breast throughout their lives. We must see from head to toe. Always receive new patients, and pack outpatients after surgery, rehabilitation, and discharge. Every doctor is a self-employed person responsible for his patients. That's really funny. "" (Kwon Joon-sik) Most trauma patients are young. If you pull it from the oblique line and treat it well, it will keep you healthy. As I work hard, I feel rewarding when my patients get better, "" (Moon Jong-hwan) said during the interview, "" It is hard. "" Instead, he showed a strong sense of pride in his work. Q : How did you get to the trauma center?A : Moon : Lee, the director of the center, led me by saying, "" I need a chest surgeon. "" I felt I could use my abilities to do more. At that time, Lee avoided professors at the thoracic surgery who dragged me in.Kang : I went to see a surgeon because I wanted to deal with life. As I was 4 years old, I was sent to see a trauma surgeon for a month. Professor Lee's ideals and my thoughts were right, so I decided to do so.Kwon : Since I was a resident doctor, I have been talking about my desire to become a trauma specialist. Then he was introduced to Professor Lee Guk-jong, who was a director of the Credit Association in 2010. I first saw a doctor who was in charge at the time. Professor Kwon told Professor Kang and Director Lee of the Center. The director of the center allegedly worked very hard to attract Professor Kang. I kept asking Professor Kwon, "" How's he doing? "" Lee, the director of the center, secretly rumored, He (referring to Professor Kang) goes to trauma surgery. Q : Is it hard to ride helicopters?A : Moon : As soon as you ride on a helicopter, the strange environment begins. I'm nervous and don't perform as usual. When Jeon Im - doctor (specialist's degree deepening), he prayed for a patient on a helicopter and failed. It was a failure in five years. Outside the hospital is a completely different space. It is different from in-hospital treatment. Nobody helps me. My wife says that her heart shakes when she watches news of a helicopter crash on TV. I pray and ride each time.Kang : The hospital has a monitor to monitor the patient's condition, such as blood pressure, but not outside. I'm terrified that a patient will die if I fail. I am always afraid.Kwon : It is dangerous in terms of the safety of medical personnel. In the United States, flying doctors are three to five times more likely to die than police exposed to fire. They received calls and told them to do so even during interviews. She also went to a conference to review the patients who died. There are such meetings every week. They are investigating whether the patient who died was really killed or could have been saved by making improvements. It brought the U.S. system. The University of Azu trauma center is set to America's best standards. The Ajudae Center receives the most patients and saves the most. Moon said, We have a goal to present models to other hospitals. All of the members have this sense of duty. Professor Kwon said, Our center needs to receive more patients than now. The United States estimates it needs one center per million people. 9 million people live in the southern part of Kyong-gi, which is the jurisdiction of our center. But there are not many patients. `` The transportation system is wrong. Serious trauma patients are dying elsewhere (emergency rooms), where they must live from the start. The medical personnel should be twice as long as they are now, Moon said. The government needs to fill in doctors and nurses when it talks about all the time. Suwon : Baek Soo-jin, a journalist at Ajou University Hospital, is Professor Kwon Jun-sik who works with Professor Lee Kook-jong at the Critical trauma center. Professor Kwon Joon-sik (35) and Professor of Internal Medicine, Jong-hwan University, Professor of trauma surgeon, Seoul National University Hospital, and Professor of trauma surgeon at Aju University Hospital, along with Professor Lee Guk-jong of Foreign Affairs at Ajou University Hospital Woo Sang-Hwan (38) At the University of California, Seoul National University Medical University, Professor of Chest Surgery, Aju University, and Professor of Cardiological Surgery at Aju University's University Hospital Woo Sang-jo : Kang Byung-hee (34), a graduate of the University of Azu University School of Medicine, a trauma surgeon at the University of California, says, "" I don't get any attention from Lee Gook-seong, assistant director of trauma surgeon's department at Azu University. I checked with the three professors. Lee Guk-jong, head of the Center for Korean Studies, appeared on a TV program in August and revealed malicious comments made by online physicians ` communities. It's a famous straw box. Beating and holding their junior. ' When I asked Moon Jong-hwan, who worked with Lee, "" Have you ever been hit? "" he laughed, "" That's not true. "" "" I think Lee was the first president of Azu University Medical School, so I take extra care of my juniors by studying for the mock tests, "" he said. "" I felt terrible when I operated on medical students because I had no doctors. "" Rather, respect for younger students is inherent. Interns are also called ` Sir ○○ `. Rumors about 800 million won ($ 800 million) in debt to pay for a helicopter also differed. Although the deficit is correct, the hospital did not pay individual debts but take care of it. We can live off of the fact that we believe that having a trauma surgeon owes us money, said Professor Moon Jong-hwan, who is quoted as saying by the university as saying, It would only make a disadvantage in assessing achievements or hiring. Professor Kwon Joon-sik said, Since 2002, the director of the center has been pointing out the problems with the medical care system for patients with severe trauma. We have made little progress with the 2011 appointment of Seok Hae-kyoon, chief of the ship's captain. We need an instrument. Professor Moon Jong-hwan says, "" It is at least because of the price of the director's name. "" `` I've been getting a lot busier lately, but my morale is on the rise. We hope the day will come when trauma surgeons are recognized in the medical profession. I had some mental ups and downs as a doctor, but the director of the center took good care of me and overcame it, says Professor Kang Byung-hee. ▶ Central Daily [Facebook] [Kakao Plus Friend] [Mobile web] and JTBC Content Hub Co., Ltd.

"U.S. Air Force F-22 fighters are flying high-altitude for air combat training. U.S. Air Force stealth, or stealth technology that disables the enemy without being seen, was a key factor in the fight regardless of age or time. Wearing a camouflage suit or applying a fake cream similar to the natural environment was also part of stealth, which hid the enemy from the identity of the enemy.Stealth, which has been changing since the war on Earth, now rules the skies of East Asia, combined with state-of-the-art technology. Standing at its zenith are U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptors and F-35 fighters. The fighters participated in the Korea-U.S. Air Force's "" Vigilant Ace "" training exercises on July 4-8 and served as the spearhead of an armed protest against North Korea.China and Russia are also concentrating on developing stealth fighters. China is developing the J-20s and the FC-31, while Russia is developing the SU-57. However, it is expected to take some time before the government can launch full-scale operations since it is facing difficulties in areas such as engine and electronic equipment. As a result, U.S. stealth fighters will continue to dominate the air in the next decade or so.U.S. Air Force F-22 fighters are flying high-altitude for air combat training. USAF provided stealth technology crystal F-22 and F-35 generally consider the angular face of the aircraft surface, but this is to minimize the portion of the radar detection area. Stealth technology includes ways to hide electronic signals emitted by aircraft or to avoid giving enemy radars time to detect them at very high speeds.Developed by Lockheed Martin and conducted its first test flight in 1962, the SR-71 reconnaissance plane is considered the first generation stealth jet to avoid enemy radar and missile attacks at high flight speeds. At Mach 3 and with ultra-quality stealth functions, the SR-71 was undetectable by any missile or radar. North Vietnam and North Korea fired SA-2 ground-to-air missiles, and Russia developed and deployed MiG-25 interceptors but failed to intercept. After appearing in 1991, the F-117A, which was sent to the Gulf War, carried out an air raid by penetrating the Iraqi army's radar deep into interior of Iraq. U.S. Air Force F-22 fighters fly over Langley, Virginia, on April 6, last year. U.S. Air Force is currently the main force behind stealth fighter jet F-22 Raptors. Unlike the F-117A, who was only used for ground attacks, he has a strong air combat capability. The origin of F-22 Raptors is Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) projects that were developed in 1981. Targeted to thoroughly control all of the fighter jets developed by the U.S. hostile nations, ATF was able to detect performance, mobility and remote enemy fighter capabilities. As a result of fierce competition among all aerospace companies in the U.S., Lockheed Martin adopted F-22 Raptors in 1991.Focusing on strong stealth performance, the F-22 Raptors only have a 0.0001 ㎡ coverage. On radar, F-22 Raptors are not easy to detect, so they look like insects. The stealth was so strong that it marked an F-22 Raptor shooting down about 100 enemy fighters in a simulated air battle, earning it the nickname the "" King of the End of the Sky. "" APG-77 MultI-Functional Phase Array (AESA) radar to locate enemies up to 250 km/h, a data-link system capable of sharing real-time information, and electronic warfare equipment to disrupt enemy missile attacks. The structure of the gas is also very strong. The F-22 is designed to fly for 8,000 hours, but in reality, it can fly for up to 15,000 hours without having to upgrade. The U.S. Air Force currently operates 184 F-22s. Originally, the company wanted to produce and deploy more than 700 cars, but the number of units operated decreased significantly due to the price of $ 370 million (400 billion won) per company. Instead, the U.S. Air Force is planning to operate F-22 Raptors by 2060, and is preparing to improve its performance by sharing real-time information with unmanned aerial vehicles and adding the ability to carry sophisticated guided weapons.If F-22 is a "" premium stealth limitation "" for the U.S. Air Force, Lockheed Martin's F-35 is a "" supply stealth "" fighter for the U.S. and its allies. F-35, which is scheduled to introduce 2,243 units of stealth and stealth fighters, will use 3,344 billion dollars (459 trillion won) in its annual mission to develop the U.S. Air Force, the Navy and Marines.On August 7, F-35A fighter jets take off from the Air Force base in Utah, the United States. For the U.S. Air Force, the F-35 revolutionized the cockpit, the brain of the fighter jet. The mechanical dashboard installed in the cockpit of the existing fighter has been replaced by one large display. Larger displays were equipped with touch screen technologies similar to smartphones, allowing the pilot to respond easily to emergencies. In addition, it increased the survival rate by equipped with an advanced electronic warfare ratio, which tracks the target's location in real time and identifies enemy missiles flying by.The United States is deploying F-35 to East Asia in the face of strategic provocations from North Korea, including the launch of a ballistic missile. In January, 16 F-35B F-35B units belonging to the U.S. Marine Corps were deployed at IwakunI camp in Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, and the U.S. Air Force deployed the U.S. Air Force in Okinawa last month. The F-35A deployed at Gadena will stay at the base for six months and undergo various training. The Air Force is scheduled to introduce 40 F-35As between next year and 2021. The F-35A, introduced by the Air Force, prevents the North's air force from descending into the South in case of an emergency and also carries out key strike targets, including nuclear, ballistic missiles and WMD. As U.S. stealth fighters fly around the country and show their dominance, China and Russia are also aggressively developing stealth bombers.Russian su- 57 fighter jets are standing by on the runway for a test flight. Sputnik the United States has developed the Su-57 seutelseusteel fighter aircraft to combat F-22 Raptors and F-35. Russian news agency Tass quoted a Russian trade minister as saying on July 6, "" The SU-57, with the latest engines, flew for 17 minutes at the JukovskiI Gromov airfield near Moscow. "" Su-57, which will replace the Russian Air Force's Su-27 and Mig-31 aircraft, is said to have adopted a plasma-high powered stealth system that absorbs radar transmissions completely. A single seat, Su-57, can reach a speed of Mach 2 at an altitude of 20,000m and has a maximum flying distance of 3500km. It is equipped with high performance multifunction phase array (AESA) radar. They are equipped with Kh-35 UE air-to-ship cruise missiles (260 km), Kh-38 ME air-to-surface missiles (40 km) and T-77 ME air-to-air missiles (200 km). China's J-20`s stealth fighter was reportedly developed by the Chengdu Aerospace Company of China in the late 1990s and tested by 2010, and succeeded in flying the first aircraft in 2011. It was originally estimated that Russian AL-37F engines were used, but Chinese WC-NC models were used. China`s Defense Ministry confirmed last September that the T-50 has already been deployed in action and its test flights are progressing smoothly according to plan. China is also developing an FC-31 stealth fighter plane for mounting in an aircraft carrier.Russia and China are speeding up the development of stealth bombers, but it will take a long time to see any substantial results. Russia's Su-57 was not clear on the scale of its introduction in Russia. It is because of an engine problem. The engine currently installed in Su-57 is the AL-41F engine installed in the Su-35S fighter jet. With improved fuel efficiency and thrust, the next generation engines are not available until 2025. For the Russian Air Force, there is no need to urgently introduce the Su-57 engine, which is equipped with an outdated engine.China's J-20s are conducting a test flight.China's G-20 and FC-31 have worse. The Chinese WS-10 Advanced engines, which are equipped with J-20s, do not have superclusing capabilities essential for noise reduction and improved fuel efficiency. China is pushing for a new WS-150 engine from China to solve the problem, but China is reportedly facing difficulties. Control, stealth paint, gas refining and infrared sensors are also problematic. However, many point out that if China continues to invest heavily, it can easily solve the problem of the G-20. It is difficult to fight the F-22 Raptors in the U.S., but some say it is possible to attack U.S. Air Force tankers or early warning and control aircraft with PL-150, which is the range of missiles. FC-31 also faces 20 years of use of existing J-15 aircraft due to engine problems and excessive weight.Even though stealth fighters from Russia and China are practical, it is not easy to reverse the dominance of the U.S. in the air. The United States is internally proceeding to develop a sixth-generation stealth fighter to replace the F-35. Still exploring the performance of the sixth-generation stealth fighter, but the sixth-generation stealth fighter was not detected by radar and was therefore able to withstand the intensity of its presence in human sight. Given that Russian and Chinese stealth technology lags behind the U.S., the U.S.'s dominance in East Asia and other regions is expected to continue for the time being.Park Soo-chan, reporter of the press at psc@segye.com"
"As Samsung Heavy Industries & Construction announced that it expects to lose up to 730 billion won in operating costs this year and next year, management, including management, will be forced to change their management company's losses this year. Samsung Heavy Industries is expected to replace its management completely, and a crisis aftershock is being detected in the case of creditors.Industry watchers said it is unusual to forecast operating losses of more than 700 billion won on July 9, adding, It is a follow-up measure, in which Park and her management will be replaced by their planned replacement within this month.Earlier, Samsung Heavy Industries Co. said it plans to seek a capital increase worth 1.5 trillion won as it expects total loss of 730 billion won this year and next year. It is to deal with risks, such as financial instability, first. "" Samsung Heavy Industries and Construction announced yesterday that its orders last year plunged to $ 500 million (10 percent of its $ 5.3 billion goal) due to deteriorating shipbuilding business, and that it has been able to restructure its orders from 2018 by streamlining its fixed costs and expanding its workforce.However, changes in management are likely to be inevitable due to the unprecedented large-scale earnings announcement. It also analyzed that the latest personnel reshuffle of Samsung Group, which calls for people over 60 years old to resign, will have an influence on the group. Samsung Heavy Industries Co. announced in a decision to convene a shareholders ` meeting to announce an extraordinary shareholders ` meeting next Jan. 26. In particular, three new directors will be appointed as their chief executives as part of the shareholders ` meeting.According to the official report, the internal candidate for the post is Nam Joon-woo (1958), the vice president of Chosun Corporation, Jeong Hae-kyu (1962), and Kim Joon-cheol (1959), director of the Marine PM. Samsung Heavy Industries and Construction has seven board members, including three inside and four outside directors. As the number of corporate directors does not grow, the three directors will have to resign from the board. The three executive directors are Park Dae-young (1953), Jeon Tae-heung (1958), and Kim Hyo-seop (1956), the vice president of management support office.Signs of crisis are also emerging in areas under creditor management, including Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. and Seongdong Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. after Samsung Heavy Industries ` earnings deficit Coming Out. The Korea Institute for Economic Reform recently announced that four conglomerates including Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering are showing signs of failure. Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. had more than 200 percent of its combined debt as of the end of 2016 and had less than a one-fold combined interest coverage, according to the report. In short, a firm with an interest coverage ratio less than a factor of one means a company that can not afford to pay interest on its annual operating profit.Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering has achieved 2.48 trillion won among its self-proposed goals (2.77 trillion won) so far so far so far, and has recorded a performance rate of 90 percent. However, it is expected to have a tough year next year, such as restructuring, to reach the overall self-description planning goal of 5.9 trillion won by 2020.Until now, Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering sold its Seoul office and Dangsan offices for about 170 billion won and 35.2 billion won, and also distributed construction of its subsidiaries Disek, Wellive and Daewoo Shipbuilding. The number of employees including would-be retirements, retirements, and retirements is also decreased by 3300, and all office workers, including production workers, are being given unpaid leave every month to return between 10 to 15 percent of their wages.As for Seongdong Shipbuilding Ocean Co., the results of the due diligence are more valuable, attention will be paid to the future direction of its handling. It is the first time that the liquidation value has been high. According to creditors, the due diligence on the company began in August, the company temporarily estimated the value of liquidation to be 700 billion won and the value of its life span to be 200 billion won.Seongdong Shipbuilding Ocean began its voluntary agreement in 2010. Export-import banks have donated 2 trillion won to Seongdong Shipbuilding, the nation's largest brokerage bank. Another industry insider said, Considering the logic of the economy, it is not easy to decide whether 500 billion won would be a profit to close the doors, but it is a cold question to the local people whether the decision would be made before next year`s local elections.No Taeyoung factpoet@asiae.co.kr▶ Yang Nak-kyu's "" Military Story "" : # Seeing an Asian economy on Facebook < ⓒ-world-viewing, I'm sure many of you are suffering from the flu during the cold weather. If this happens, I want to lie down in a warm bed and relax with the heat on inside. However, keeping the boiler open for a long time causes concern about whether or not you get hit by a heating bomb. Is there any way to save on heating and spend the winter warmly?Today at SBS Life, we learned how to save on heating costs easily and easily.If the room temperature is set too high by high heating, the air can become dry and cause dry skin or respiratory problems. It is advisable to keep the room temperature between 18 and 20 degrees Celsius during winter. According to the Seoul Housing Corporation, lowering the indoor temperature by one degree saves up to 7 percent on heating costs.Some of you may feel cold if you keep the room temperature between 18 and 20 degrees. Keeping your body warm by keeping the room at that temperature and wearing socks, sleeping pants, cardigan, underwear, and so on will do you good.It is not advisable to cycle the boiler power too often. Leaving the boiler out of mode (or in lowest mode) when going out is generally known to save on heating. This is because it takes a lot of gas to power the boiler up again and heat the water in the boiler.However, you should also use the exit mode as appropriate. It is advisable to turn off the boiler when you are out or on a trip for extended periods. There are exceptions when you're away from home for a long time. Due to the high risk of freeze on the boiler during cold weather, it is advisable to keep it out of mode.Turning on the boiler and humidifier simultaneously reduces the boiler's running time compared to running the boiler alone. High humidity in the room makes the room warm quicker by circulating the air by the steam it produces. Water droplets also keep the heat longer, so the temperature of the room they went up once will slow down. If you don't have a humidifier, hang a laundry or wet towel to increase the humidity of your room.If you want to get a good look at the heating, it is important to avoid the cold wind. To keep the inner heat open for a long time by blocking the cold wind that enters through the windows, it is helpful to close the curtain or to apply an insulated air cap, also referred to as the cover. In recent years, there are also a variety of wall-to-long-long-long-long-long-present curtains available on the market, so you can buy them according to their window size. Carpets or blankets on the floor also preserve residual heat to keep warm for longer.Managing the boiler well also helps you save on heating costs. First of all, it is important to check your age at regular intervals. According to research by the Korea Gas Safety Corporation, older boilers over 10 years of use have reduced their heating efficiency by 85 percent.To improve heating efficiency, it is recommended that for gas boilers change the heating water every two to three years. Piping and filters should be cleaned before heating up. When foreign substances are accumulated in piping and filters, the flow of hot water is blocked and the heating effect is reduced.Why don't you use cold weather gear with a few quick ideas to save on heating bills? If you feel like you're smiling in the face when you put a curtain on it, it's also a good idea to try something called a spray that says it creates insulation. As the number of one-to-two people households grows, products with a large heating area at least recently become popular.Under the table was a single-person heating table with a hot air balloon and a wide range of candle heaters for indoor and outdoor activities. A combination of heating mouse pads, a secondary battery and a hand stove can help keep you warm for less than 2-3,000 won.I hope you enjoy the warm winter with easy ways to save on your heating bills.( Planning & Composition : Jung Yoon-sik, Jang Ah-ram / Design : Ahn Joon-seok) Jeong Yoon-sik, Joon-sik Correspondent News (jys@sbs.co.kr) [funds] Participation in Undistributed Singers&M Support : SBS → View here!"
"Due to the popularity of the drones in his 40s or 50s and difficulties, ‘ Driving license and handling license is similar ’ / 2 million won per day, and in the training camp, he received an import certificate of 500,000 won per photo shoot"" Clear! Clear right! "" a state certificate of qualifications for drones (ultra-light flying device unmanned multicophotor qualified pilots) was set up at Kyung-dong Kyung-In Kyung-in, Gyeonggi Province yesterday afternoon. The airport was packed with students seeking qualifications as a pilot certificate of qualifications was recently highlighted, with the creation of new jobs related to drones and singer Kim Geon-mo citing them for his old age.Described to practice being drawn as the first, Kang (50, female) successfully started the flight from the control position by raising the profile of the left, the direction of the wind, the condition of the drones and the position of the floor. As the right controller was carefully raised, the Chinese test taker, mg- sron, flew up slowly turning a propeller.Kang, who said, "" I prepared a drone certificate to prepare teachers for after school, "" successfully moved left, right, and flew around in a circle, while listening to the instructor's praise. `` I was scared at first that it would fall out of the sky, '' Kang said. `` It didn't seem hard enough for anyone to challenge if I flew with safety in mind. '' Gyeongin National University of Education, which is equipped to obtain a drone certificate, exercises such as trigonometric flight, Wonju flight, and emergency landing are held centering on the reference rabacon.The ‘ drones ’ certification test conducted at the Korea Transportation Safety Authority consists of the first written test dealing with mechanics, weather, legislation, and other handling and handling skills and oral tests. The written test can pass with a score of 70 or more and the practical test must be carried out according to mandatory flight procedures of 20 hours at a designated educational institution, followed by a full reversing, a triangular flight, and an emergency GPS (Global Positioning System).Preparation for the practical examination was quite similar to a driving test. As with the automobile functional tests, the evaluation is made of the lavacon, straight ahead, triangle, and circumference flights, with its triangular layout at the airport. When a drone is on a rabacon, the brush on top of it comes down to check its position. The test is performed at a lower speed than the actual flight. Move the drone slowly and precisely as if the vehicle were moving gently in the driver's license test station.The reporter also asked the instructor to try a simple drone flight. As soon as I grabbed the drone control stand, comments were received about my posture. The control arm should reach down and the controller should move with the fingertips to avoid movement of the hands. Though he had ever flown a drone as a hobby, he was not easy because he had to observe procedures and theft as a result of getting certified. And I felt the wind affected the size of the drones used for the tests. As the wind moved back and forth, it came down gradually, and I felt uneasy. But it didn't seem that hard to pass if you were calm and slow to steer.As it was not hard to control, many of the trainees visited the training center were in their 40s or 50s. They all agreed on the prospects and tried for a certificate of qualifications. Kim (50), who runs a greenwood company, saw that his colleague had left a photo of a certificate in a bag and decided to send it, so he hung it up as if it were the only delivery certificate he had ever made. Aunt (55) also said, "" I learn from the beauty and promise of the drones ; I expected them to be utilized in a wide range of fields in the next two or three years, and I decided I should learn them beforehand. ""As such, the number of people challenging themselves to obtain certificates is on the increase. The number of applicants for the drawn-and-lesse test, or the final barrier to the drawn-licensing test, has increased to more than three times this year since 2015, according to the Korea Transportation Safety Administration.On the other hand, preparing for a drone certificate requires a substantial cost. In the case of the "" drone qualified A "" academy, the curriculum was 2.6 million won for two weeks on weekdays, and the curriculum for five weeks on weekends was 3 million won for the academy and 3.5 million won for the weekend. In other words, it costs about 3 million won to get a certificate in education alone. Some institutions require tuition fees up to 6 million won. Instructors to check drone after last five days. After flight they check propeller, battery, arm rest, motor, etc."" The gas price is high, and the tuition is not low because there are not many instructors who can afford it, "" said Park Seong-cheol, director of the Education Academy of Incheon National University. "" Still, the focus of the Industrial Revolution is on the drones now being paid.Currently, drones are utilized in various fields, such as prevention, video, and surveying, and are known to provide substantial income guarantees. A national certificate of drones currently available for commercial use or to control drones weighing more than 12kg requires national authorised drones ; Kim Min-tae, a 32 year-old farmer who is known to have been involved in the project, said, "" If you were able to utilize drones more actively in the control sector, you could earn 20-70 won per pyeong and earn 200-70,000 won per pyeong. ""Ahn Seung-jin, a reporter for the Korea Exchange, said, "" World's Global Media Daily, price of gold and gold prices are dropping next year. Idaly DB [Daily Kim Jong-nam] is a ' slightly special ' jewelry. Need no long explanation Gold has long been synonymous with decorative jewelry. The appeal of gold continues to this day. What sets gold apart from other precious metals is its monetary function, which has long been the most important currency. Gold is itself a valuable, reliable, and easy to transport and store jewelry. As the safest asset today, gold is attractive to investors.For example, a gold stone ring means to live happily ever after, and includes wisdom to sell gold that can never be devalued.However, interest is focused on the recent decline in the price of gold.◇ Interest rate ↑ … = Price of gold plummeted geumnak. .. ssda. .erced a $ 0.36 percent decline in the price of gold futures for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange, according to the market point. It is the lowest level in nearly five months since July 20 ($ 124.8). Gold was once valued at $ 1,300 per ounce last month, but has plummeted recently.The same is true of silver, which is actually linked to gold prices. On the same day in December, the gifts were priced at $ 15.74 per ounce. It is the lowest level in nearly five months since early July. The price of gold sold in Korea is also dropping. As of July 8, the closing price of gold (3.75g) in the Korean exchange's gold market was 165,555 won. It was the lowest level in more than a year and 10 months since it closed at 163,425 won on February 4 last year.There is a reason why the price of gold is falling. One of the first to join the picture is the recent global economic environment in which interest rates are rising and prices are slowing.First, the interest rate. One characteristic of gold assets is the absence of cash flow. For example, if a person owns a bond, he or she will receive an interest and if he or she buys stocks, they will receive a dividend. Gold, however, is not like that. It is the representative of nothing and assets. Interest rates on U.S. government bonds at that time were 2.3762 %. They were traded in the 2.1 % to 2.2 % range by mid-year, but have been creeping up lately. A rise in real interest rates would inevitably hurt the attractiveness of interest-free assets.Prices are also being bearish. Gold is a classic asset to hedge inflation risks. That means that the lower the price, the higher the pressure to reduce the price of gold. The unusually low price is considered the most hot topic in the global economy.The price of gold futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange has been on the rise since June this year. Gold prices have fallen to their lowest level in four months due to rising global interest rates. Source : Market Point ◇ Next year's gold price reduction is another sign of a stronger dollar. Gold is traded in dollars. As the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy rate hike approaches and the dollar's value increases, the relative gold value falls. The dollar index rose for the fifth day last night to 93.895. The dollar index is the index of the value of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of the six major countries.It is not just about this. The Bitcond wave is also believed to be the cause of the weakness. We don`t know how many gold investors have moved to Bitcone, said an official at the local financial market, but it is highly likely given the recent atmosphere.Then, will the price of gold continue to fall? If the economic situation continues, such as goldilock, the trend is likely to continue. A golderrax is a boom that is not hot or cold, that is, stable prices and good growth. The price of gold moves on an economic basis unless there is a particular supply and demand issue, Koo Kyung-hoe, an economist at KB Securities Co., said, We expect the price average to be around $ 1258 this year, but it will be lower next year.Kim Jong-nam (jungkim@edaily.co.kr) < ⓒ jonghap Economic Information Media Idaly - No Japoff & Redistribution >"
"Chew it and Apply it to Your Arms : The first of the giant apes is an orangutan picture taken at the United Arab Emirates Asia Oranangerians Presso Center in Kalimantan, Indonesia on August 16, 2007. Local media and foreign media reported on July 9 that international researchers who participated in the Center for Ecological Conservation at Exeter in Britain focused on why wild Borneo orangutans are eating poor for food. In the peat wetlands of Kalimantan State, Indonesia, orangutans have been rarely seen applying plant juice called Dracaena Kantlej to their skin since 2003. This plant, belonging to the asparagus family, is rarely fed by animals, such as its high quantity of bitter saponine. Instead, saponin has a strong anti-inflammatory effect, so residents use Drasena Kantlay's juice to treat arthritis and muscle pain, and orangutans also pay attention to it.Drasena Kantley, the herb that the wild Bornean orangutans use for flash, says scientists, "" and the women who chew on baby soap are usually used to soothe their leaves. "" The orangutans are found to have made saponine bubbles and did not swallow the remaining leaves and threw them away. Large apes such as chimpanzees, gorillas and bonobos tend to take antibiotics or non-inflammatory herbs when they become ill. However, orangutan researchers stressed, this is the first time that they have been confirmed to apply the skin to harsh treatments rather than simply eating herbs. The results of the study were published on July 30 in the online edition of the British international journal Nature. hwangch@yna.co.kr. A revision of the Tax Accountant Law, which repealed the license of tax accountants are automatically granted to lawyers, passed the National Assembly on July 8. The National Assembly held a plenary session on the same day and passed a revision bill to the tax accountant's law. The revision to the tax law was passed by 215 votes in favor of, nine against, and 23 abstentions out of 247 seats. The revision was proposed following the criticism that it was unreasonable to automatically obtain the license of a tax attorney or a patent attorney without a separate examination if one obtained the license. Lawyers have automatically qualified as tax accountant since the Act was enacted in 1961. The tax association has been protesting that it is not appropriate for an unqualified lawyer to be qualified as a tax accountant. Meanwhile, the Korean Bar Association said it had no problem handling tax affairs through lawyers. The two groups clashed sharply in their respective lobbying at the National Assembly, a National Assembly official said. Korean Bar Association Chairman Kim Hyun (second right) shaved his head in front of the National Assembly to protest a revision. Kim, head of the Korean Bar Association, issued a statement after the law was passed, claiming that the revised tax code undermines the foundations of the lawyer system and disarms the people of choice. Chairman Kim and others protested while holding a ceremony to close the doors in front of the National Assembly building. We will also launch an endless struggle until the abolition of the revised tax accountant law. Please participate actively. However, the tax association released a press release and said, It is quite overwhelming that the tax consultants ` long-cherished desire has been fulfilled. According to the revision to the Tax Accountant Act of 2003, those who obtained legal status after 2004 can not work as tax agents because they can not register with the Association of Certified Public Accountants. However, those who passed the 45th bar examination that was conducted in 2003 and those who passed the bar examination before will be allowed to register as tax consultants and work as agents. The revision did not pass the committee of Legislation and Judiciary Committee, but it is also the first time that it was directly raised to the plenary session through the provisions of the National Assembly's advancement law. Article 86 of the National Assembly Act provides for the chairman of the parliamentary committee to call on the chairman of the bill through an interdepartmental consultation if the judiciary committee did not review the bill before it was submitted without reason. Cho Kyung-tae, chairman of the planning and finance committee of the ruling Grand National Party of Korea, requested National Assembly Chairman Chung Se-kyun to take part in a plenary session on the revision of the tax accountant bill that was pending at the Legislation and Judiciary Committee on July 17. Bills containing the revision of the tax code passed on that day have been proposed every time since the 16th National Assembly, but failed to pass the parliamentary judiciary committee gates every time. Many say that the bill was rejected by the judiciary committee, which was widely criticized by former Congressman Yulsa. Meanwhile, the National Assembly passed a revision to the local tax law, which would raise the rates on cigarette electronic cigarettes, such as Ikos and glow. The bill raises the consumption tax rate for cigarette electronic cigarettes to 897 against the current 528 won per cigarette. Baek Min-kyung journalist baek.minkyung Joongang.co.crt."
"The paintings of the MultI-Industrial MultI-Industrial Flower Polis and Sopists in the East and West B.C., the supply of Iron and Steel Pitcher, and the spread of letters of the East and West, as well as the assassination of the East and Rome The Roman Legions had strong daggers, long spears and shields. What secret was there in Eastern and Western cultures? The Human Revolution has answered this question two times. Why did the four world saints, Socrates, Confucius and Buddha, work together at the same time, and at the same time make a magnificent display of the spiritual flowers? First of all, in Greece, the rise of the 5th century urban state and the rise of the Sofist led to the rise of the humanities. As more than 200 polipos develop each other through competition of good will, productivity has soared and the status of citizens has emerged. Citizens have developed civilization by implementing direct democracy for the first time in human history. The advent of the Sofist, the home of such citizens, was crucial to the flowering of learning and thought diversity. At the same time, the Chunchu War era began in China. As we enjoyed material affluence from agricultural innovation, we developed a new class of farmers. So, that is the birth of sa 士. As the first group of intellectuals to appear in Chinese history, it helped Jehu to reign and also became a teacher of the aristocratic families. Je-goo Baekga. It is no exaggeration to say that the origins of East Asian philosophy and thought were all formed at this time, such as Yuga, Buddo and Dodo. It is the technological innovations that happened in the East and West that enable the intellectual class to emerge at the same time. Iron farming implements diffused, and ' Woogyeong ' began. The agricultural revolution, which was not possible during the Bronze Age, led to a rapid increase in productivity and an active exploration of the origins and nature of the world beyond just ' feeding '. Click on the photo to go to Yoonseokman's homepage of human revolution. But the East and the West have a similar history again. It's the rise of the empire. In the East, we have the Qin, and in the West, the Roman Empire. The days when 150 or 200 small countries were competing are over, and a giant dynasty has begun. Today's Human Revolution is about two countries that had empires in different parts of the world at the same time, called the "" Human Revolution. "" It's about Rome and the camps of two countries. Let's take a trip of imagination, together, to see what they have in common, what would happen if they collided. Samacheon (1914-86 BC), written by King Sejong the Great, is an assassin of the late king. Since the age of 20, Samacheon has traveled all over China to collect data and become a Taesaryeong, or a Taesaryeong, to search the national libraries. He not only wrote the story of the Emperor and the Queen, but also of the assassin who tried to assassinate them. And the best part is about a man who tried to kill Qin Shi Huang. Samacheon Sacheon Guangi's book, ` The Assassination of the Assassination, ` contains a full account of the brothers ' attempts to assassinate Qin Shi Huang. [Naver] My brother is from the late Jeonguk period. As Jin destroyed the stomach, he went to live in a country called Yeon-yi. Although he excelled in military arts, he was unable to express the sorrow of losing his country, and he became addicted to drinking every day. He had a friend called Gojeom-ri, who was an artist who was good at playing the Axis. My brother often drank and drank in his drinking cup. Each time, I sang and danced in the middle of the song to the melody of the spindle. She criticized the people who destroyed her country and mourned the dizzy times. His actions unfolded as if there was no one around him. Later, this style of portrait became known as the ‘ Bangnyakchamsan ’. The movie is set with the motif of the brother, "" Hero. "" It was directed by Zhang Yimou and played by Li Lianzhe, a character based on the brother, "" Nonna. "" But he was as profound an academic scholar as martial arts and drinking and singing. The down-right wise man and the hero of the year found him. One day, the elder brother was asked to kill the portrait of the king by the king of Yeon-yi. At that time, Jin was about to unify the country, and King Jinwang's portrait was still honored as a Shi HuangdI. As shown in the film "" Hero, "" directed by Zhang Yimou with an older brother as his motif, the older brother was a master of martial arts. In the film, I called it the "" Boul-Boyel "". That means anyone who stands ten steps ahead can be killed at once. The elder brother puts his head together with the close allies who loved King Jin-wang, who put the whole nation in blood. The elder brother decides to kill King Jin-wang and take his own life there. But the problem was getting close to King Jin-wang through countless guards at the royal court. Just then, King Jin-jin said, "" If you bring the neck of Bun-gee, the General of Jin, you will have an opportunity to receive an audience with him within ten steps. "" The elder brother went to the wonderment to explain what he means, and the younger brother hit his neck on the spot to pay tribute to his brother. The elder brother raises the neck of the trunkfish and goes to King Jinwang. The king was delighted and welcomed with all kinds of hospitality. King Jin-wang's brother, who approached the king, tried to stab him with a hidden dagger but failed. King Jin-wang, who had been trained in the war since he was a boy, was not an old-fashioned man either. In "" Hero, "" director Jang Yi-moo captured the unique film version of the royal fight between King Jin-wang and his brother. In the movie, their martial arts skills are neck and neck. But the brothers ended up being brutally murdered. Enraged, King Jin-jin beheaded the dead brother's body. The following year, in 226 B.C., King Jin-jin invaded the kite that sent him an assassin to destroy them. Ironically, the attempt to assassinate her would have resulted in the unification of the nation's leaders. After several assassination attempts, King Jin-jin became increasingly brutal and brutal. The territory of all seven countries before Jinnara unified China. China, that's where the brightness of China started. Qin Shi Huang abolished the feudal system that had been carried out until the end of the former imperial regime and adopted the Gunhyeon system, leaving China under the control of the emperor. He ruled strictly based on strong military power and the belief of the law. Especially, as I believe that conflicts and conflicts occurred due to different cultures and lifestyles in different countries, I tried to unify social, economic and cultural cultures as well as the territory. First, I decided to eliminate all of the different currencies from each country, and I would use the unified currency that Jin had made. And in the whole world, there were a lot of different writing systems in different parts of the world, but Jean wrote the words of the world. This was done to strengthen the power of centralized power with the implementation of the military system. We also bring together weights and measures to accelerate commercial development. They also define the size and breadth of the wheels and standardize on road. The standard of jeans built at this time became the basis of the Chinese dynasty, which lasted for 2,000 years. One country that had a breast following Jin actually used the same system that Jinsihuang had built. Jinnara's army was centered on horse cavalry. [EBS Documentary]But excessive flow is not always enough. The will to unify these animals extends to the academic and the thought. From the players who used to be masters of Chinese characters, people started to criticize the political, social and cultural systems of Jin. The director who was honored by the first prize (1910-1908) made a strong proposal. It's a sunkering oil. In feudal times, the nation was thrown into confusion by the endless wars, but now we have found peace and stability through unification. However, some of the people who have learned the old books are against the new system and culture because they believe they are only right about the past. Burn them all but practical books on real life, on agriculture, and on the reverse. "" At the suggestion of the director, Qin Shi Huang put out the fires. Back then, when paper was invented, he wrote on bamboo paper called ‘ Jukgan ’ and wrote many rare books that disappeared. We call it the Book of Bunseo. The following year, when the palace was built, Qin Shi Huang called in people who studied Buddha's life and paid tribute to it generously, some of whom went into hiding. And that started to make a lot of people criticize the real situation. Then he killed almost 500 of his own dead men, who killed all the officials who had criticized him and the larvae. This is referred to as ' gangrel '. As such, the reign of terror in Qin Shi Huang grew stronger and stronger, and more and more people took his enemies as his brother did. The invincible army, the invincible army, but the Jinnara Cavaliers were powerful. The man who dreamed of burning himself could identify with God and govern the whole of China with strong military power and centralization. Until right before reunification, Jin's army was scared to the point of stopping a crying child. The other six countries were so brave and powerful that they could not approach each other. First Unified Kingdom"
"The soldier's strength and discipline have helped him overthrew the enemy. The 8000 full-sized bottles discovered at the Qin Shi Huang tomb of Xian, China, depict the greatness of Jin at that time as a military country. Because of the war, Jin's army was good at siege warfare. The other side was busy defending the castle. The camp is lined up one meter apart by the soldiers to surround the castle and fight. As a result, weapons such as cloud vehicles and vehicles designed to carry the wall were developed. It means that they can go as high as clouds. The weapon used in siege warfare, the Unje. Jinnara used a lot of it as a weapon for the foot soldiers to climb the castle. Distance weapons such as the bow are developed. Unlike the palace, which is a personal weapon for soldiers, many types of mechanical activity called ‘ Roh ’ were used. One group, Jinnara, had a unit that could shoot dozens of arrows. In the movie, you see a shooting scene in the bow, like rain, and it was "" No "" that led to it. The military occupation of the armed forces, which increases the fighting spirit of the armed forces with advanced weapons, was one of the keys to maintaining a strong military. It was a military feat. As a result of their contributions to the war, they distributed doubles and land, and were exempt by those who were particularly good at bringing their relatives to justice. On the other hand, we established strict discipline to punish those next to us when we left the camp, so we could keep each other in check. In addition, the war was fought frequently in countries throughout the nation, and, in addition to the camp, the book of tactics developed. There were many books published by Jeong Woo-seok, Son Bin's grandson, and Sama Yang-seo's Magic. It was not just about fighting a hundred bottle battle on a wide field, but also about bizarre tactics and strategies. No, it is a mechanical tool that can fire dozens of arrows at once. It is one of Jinnara's main weapons, shooting arrows with a paddle in movies and dramas. [Hero : If] Jinnara and the Roman Empire are pitted against each other, I want to make an interesting idea here. What would have happened if Rome and Jin, the dominant ruler of the Mediterranean at the same time, had confronted each other? Starting as a city-state, Rome greatly expanded its territory in the 2nd century BC and established its empire. Especially, I took control of the Mediterranean through the Punic Wars that fought the famous Carthago Hannibal. In particular, great heroes like Julius Caesar emerged to cultivate Pax Romana. Rome's territory draws its border from the north to the north, from the current British territory to the north, and from the Rhine into the European Union. It stretches to the east near Mesopotamia and then to the south to Egypt, Libya and then to North Africa. To the west, the Iberian peninsula, which is now Spain, is incorporated into the Roman Empire, creating the Pax Romana. Rome before and after the Punic War -- Rome could develop into this great empire because of its invincible army called the Legion. Commanders ranged in size from a small order of 3000 to 4000 to as many as 6000 to 7,000. There were dozens of these camps in the prime of the Roman Empire. Each corps was joined by heavily armed infantry as the main axis of the corps and supported by cavalry. The main weapon used by the first lieutenant governor was the gladius, a dagger, which was about 50cm long. This is the weapon used by main character Russell Crowe in Gladiator. The weapon used to use with daggers was a long spear called a spear. The army went to war with a long spear and a big shield that would cover the whole body. Weapon used by foot soldiers in the Roman Empire. It holds a large shield around its entire body in the left hand and a short Gladius dagger in the right hand. On the battlefield at Matthias Kabel at Wikipedia.org] soldiers lined up tightly with shields and windows to attack, just as riot police do today. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers moved systematically as if they were just an organism, according to commander's instructions. Because of its strong military support, Rome was able to stand on its feet as a huge empire. So what if the Jinnara and the Roman empires who were in charge of themselves in the East and the West went to war? History says that assumption is meaningless, but it is also a very interesting question. If the two countries fought in or around the third century B.C., Jinnara would have been more dominant. Not only were the bravery and combat skills of the soldiers different, but the way they fought, they were very different. As you can see, the camp was the center of the battlefield, and there were various weapons of siege and standoff. The Roman Empire also used a horse and bow, but the core of the corps was the infantry. We saw a lot of armed foot soldiers fighting with Gladius and Spheres. Of course, the Jinnara army had a much larger number of foot soldiers, but the main part of the fighting was horse cavalry. When you watch the movie, which tells you about the days of Chunchu, Jinnara, and Chohanji, you can see many masters riding horses and rowing the battlefield. The fact that the war continues for hundreds of years and various military tactics were employed would give Jinnara an advantage to the army. And one more thing to look at is that when there was Jinnara, the Roman Empire was about to lay the foundations of the empire. Rome's heyday is in the first or third century, when it comes to China, it is the Han Dynasty. Gladiator fighting with a Gladius dagger and a shield -- [Movie Gladier] Power, not the power of power, but of culture -- in this military sense, Zinnara would have beaten the Roman Empire. However, the Qin Dynasty fell to ruin in just three generations from the Qin Shi Huang and Rome flourished for 1000 years. What is the reason? Johan Galtung, a Norwegian scholar who founded the Institute for International Peace, wrote in his book, "" The Structure of Imperialism and Imperialism. "" "" True empires are complete when they have the hearts of the conquered. "" Jinnara had military and economic power, but she did not have the third element, culture. Jinnara had enormous economic power to create the mysterious tomb of Qin Shi Huang, who could serve up to 8000 diseases and build the Great Wall in the north. As you can see, it was Jinnara, who had the greatest army ever. But Jinnara had no culture. The repression of ideas and learning, represented by the subduction of bonserance, has motivated the refugees to grow their hatred and anger. Jinnara's political system, which is not open and tolerant, is one of the reasons why it failed to cultivate culture. A Roman corps with a dagger, the Gladius, while the Roman Empire had a powerful tool called the Roman Culture. If Rome had only military power and economic power and had no cultural power, it would not have achieved the 1000 years of history and Pax Romana. Rome was not built in a day. When they built colonies, they respected the diversity of the local lifestyle and culture when they accepted their political system and swore loyalty. Especially when early Rome was building its empire, it was not just military conquest by force. There was a Roman style of politics through alliances and incorporation. In short, it may have been the victory of Jean in the war, but it was a landslide victory for Rome in culture. The Future of Society in Totalikol. [Movie Total Recall] The fourth industrial revolution before us is not just the development of science and industry. Technology is military power and economics in the future. If the culture behind technology doesn't work, no amount of innovation or dominance in the world will last as long as Jinnara. So mental maturity, institutions and rituals, should follow material growth. The key is to focus on diversity and build a culture that is founded on openness and tolerance. On the other hand, in a culture where public opinion is easily swayed and others are opposed to "" the enemy, "" no one can bloom with the flowers of past Athens Sophist and Chunchu's Jae-ah Baek-ga. And when everybody's thinking the same thing, and one main emphasis is on one main idea rather than the other, we could go through this same thing again as being a denservationist.

The Hong Tae-shik scandal started in March as unstable about the Korean economy. Hong, who was originally interested in block chains (an open book that records all bit-coining transactions), gets a bit of fun as the market price goes up rather than being stressed out of investment. Until now, it has spent a total of 10.9 million won on buying Bitcone, but its value has more than doubled to 2.75 million won. The intention is still to invest in virtual currency sources because we believe they will continue to develop further. #. Hyun-mo (42), who lives in Gangdong-gu, Seoul, invested in Bit-cone with a friend. When Bitcone doubled to 4 million won from 2 million won per friend at first, he decided to invest. It was purchased at 4.5 million won per BTC and was raised to 18 million won. Shares were excluded from the decline and did not rise easily according to the event, while beatcoiner was potentially more valuable and not more complicated in trading. Koreans ' interest in Bitcone is very serious. Foreign media outlets of Korea are worried that the bid might overheat. There are also concerns that the spread of "" wild wind "" beyond the high winds could turn into a gambling frenzy. The bit-coining frenzy in Korea has been overheated due to the increasing number of speculators. Some people expect the potential of the future and are interested in the Bitcone, but the tendency of virtual money to make money is to swallow its classic characteristic of high risk and make money out of speculative funds. Bitcone is especially available 24 hours a day on the virtual currency exchange that does not close unlike the general stock market, causing side effects. Investors often enter a market without limits on time or place, and can easily access it. There are even cases that she quit her well-loved job to become a bit-coined full-time investor. As many people were preoccupied with the daily beat coin market, the term "" Bitcone Zombie "" appeared.Some analyze that the underlying cause of the bitchin frenzy is not related to socio-economic unrest or the tendency of the Korean economy. Given that the phrase "" helicopter ships "" is so commonplace in the political, economic and social unrest among the minority, and the lack of a safety net for the institutional, it is easy to find a way to deal with the problem of "" individual students. "" According to a poll released by Incruit and the polling company Doit Survey on July 7, ' The nation is not a helicopter ', but only 14.2 percent of the 3710 adults responded with empathy. When asked whether they had ever dreamed of immigrating in their lives, 54.3 percent answered they had. If the society is unstable, the Koreanist sentiment will be at its base. Professor of psychology at Seoul National University Kwak Geum-joo said, "" It is okay if I can make as much money as I work hard, but if I see things going to get better or worse, I can only understand the uncertainties surrounding the ' hantage ' phenomenon and the ' hantage boom ' caused by the industry. "" Excessive expectations of success to resolve or avoid economic uncertainties also contributes to excessive heat exhaustion. Im Min-ho, a psychologist at Dankook University, said, "" I felt financial difficulties and my society was unstable, and I couldn't help but feel the value of money that people felt due to the negative effects of the coin. "" (This is not just about gambling mentality.) Bitcone is close to gambling but it is different from the lottery, explaining that Bitcoin is much more likely to succeed and is more addictive than lottery or doll sales.【 Seoul = New Sist&amp;Kim Jin-Bitch has soared for two consecutive days. Bitcons is seen on a large screen at the Coinwon Block, a virtual currency exchange, in Yeouido, Seoul, on July 8. According to KOMSCO, the Bitcone exceeded 22.5 million won at 7 a.m. on July 8, marking the highest price ever recorded. Concerns will also arise about the bitcon addiction among young people at bluesoda@newsis.com Experts warn that especially when young people are anxious about their job opportunities, their desire to visualize success can lead to bitson addiction. Professor Im said, It is the mentality that young people should make a fortune out of money and make a fortune. It is better to find happiness more often than with robbery and less with happiness. Some interpret the phenomenon of being crowded with bit coins and associate them with ethnicity. As the domestic exchange is the world's largest market for encrypted currency, the fever in Korea is particularly noticeable in the international community. It is a facet of a typical ' culture of deflection. ' As Korea is a group culture, I always care about others, Kwak said, It is also very popular because it follows others well. Because I care about others, I have a culture of decency and a strong sense of empathy for what many do. pjh@newsis.com>"
"Yeongjo, the most prosperous of the king, was the head of the National Palace Museum of Korea. Seonwonjeon Hall is where portraits of kings, known as Eojin, were kept.As the crew member burned down, portraits of King Taejo, King Sukjong, King Jeongjo, Queen Munjo (father of Sunjo, Crown Prince Hyomyeong), and Heongjong disappeared in Hwama. In addition, the traces of Hong Jeon-ho, Ma Go-ja and the calligraphy of past kings of the dynasty were not able to escape from the calamity of fire.The fire was not accidental or arson. Upon receiving the full report of the accident, Emperor Gojong told his servants when he heard the news of the fire, "" We haven't raised our spirits, "" and "" the fire broke out on the edge of the mountain. "" By this remark, one can assume that the forest fires or fires at private homes were carried over by the wind to the palace.As I was in a quandary, the emperor said, I failed to take out a portrait of the very important king.It is included in the "" Uigwe, a copy of the portrait book "" published in 1901. The book is a copy of the last portrait of Joseon Dynasty. Most of the disturbance during the Joseon Dynasty was destroyed during the Imjin War. In Seoul City Wall, where the king has left, looting and arson continues. During the mid Joseon period, the piran wagger left the gates, because before he even entered the capital city, the residents of the castle vied into the palace and took away the treasures of the king. As such, we set fire to three palaces, Changdeokgung Palace, and Changgyeong Palace, and to small and large government offices in a flash, bringing more horror and horror than the people, the citizens said. After the palace was destroyed, all the portraits of the kings of the Joseon Dynasty, including King Sejong, disappeared.However, only three Seojo scriptures, one Seojo Shrine, one Seojo Shrine, and one Seojo Shrine, which were preserved before Jeonju, were reported to have been enshrined.Later, the Sukjong Shrine began to renovate the Eojin and Jijin systems. It was intended to establish the legitimacy of the royal family. Joseon respected Eojin as if he were a real king. By holding the royal rite and confiscating the virtuous actions of the king of the previous generation, the king wanted to strengthen the royal authority and reaffirm the hierarchical order of the military and the nobility. Draw a good picture very often on the English and the Chinese sides King Jeongjo set up a manual to draw a portrait of a righteous man regularly in King Yeongjo's reign, and also encouraged him to draw a righteous man through the Gyujang-Kyujang-guk.After the fire at the Seongwon Exhibition Hall, King Gojong ordered the construction of an illustrated book (都 監, temporary government officials) to carry out work to simulate the portrait and to medium the crew exhibition.King Gojong said, The traces of kings of the past have all gone into the ashes by this day. I owe it to you only because I lack in virtue of it, because I have been so slow to pay respect to my ancestors, and because of this fire, I feel that I am deeply sorry for it. Many officials supervising the project said, Never take it easy and try to do your best to finish the project quickly.Dojejo, the chief of the manual, was commissioned by Yun Yong-seon of the Uijeongbu National Assembly (Jeong Seung-seong), and the portrait was launched in December 1900. The portrait of the seventh king was developed as an unprecedented national project, costing 1,116,600 won and over nine months. More than 40 painters from the royal family were called in. The painters played different roles. Their roles were divided into the host, the companion and the servant. The main painter draws lines on silk and when they draw shapes, the participating artist is responsible for the coloring process. The draftsman carried out other chores. Some of the most famous artists who participated in the book were Park Yong-gi, Park Yong-hun, Brothers Cho Seok-jin and Chae Yong-sin. The remaining portrait was painted by Cho Seok-jin and Chae Yong-shin.In addition, he published a book on the entire process of making a portrait, which is the protocol of copying the portrait. Uigwe is the most refined form of the royal family's portrait, encompassing rituals, procedures, and contents used in the process of copying a portrait at the same time, along with making progress. It is the last standard guide to the "" Eojin, "" a good copy of the Joseon Dynasty.The books were published and stored separately in Gyujanggak, Sigangwon, Seonwon, Seohwajeon, Uijeongbu, funeral processions and Ganghwado Island. Among them, the Korean Studies Institute of Kyujang-Kyujang-Kyujang`s has four degrees and the Academy of Korean Studies, the Academy of Korean Studies, has two classes. The old documents from Ganghwado Island were taken and stored by Japan inside the National Palace Museum of Korea and returned to Korea in 2011. The National Palace Museum of Korea is currently holding them.To honor King Taejo, government officials were dispatched by the royal court to pay tribute to King Taejo who was enshrined in Junwon, Hamgyong Province. The course was a great hassle. The procession was formed on a large scale with guards, military bands, and also maintained passing roads and bridges, and covered the road with red clay. In the past, low-ranking officials were often criticized for being a factionalist who caused harm by treating people with food and drink at diesel areas. King Gojong strictly prohibited such acts and demanded that all expenses be identified from the book.King Sukjong and Sunjo drew in Yeonghuijeon, Yeongjo in the Cold Cheonjeong, and King Munjo in Pyeongnakjeong. Younghuijeon belonged to King Taejo, Sejo, Wonjong, Sukjong, Yeongjo, and Sunjo, the police station's office. Naengcheon-jeong is inside the shrine of his mother, Suk-bin, and Young-bin, the mother of the prince of the dynasty. Each time the Emperor arrived, he received a cordial example from the Emperor himself.Why did King Gojong exert himself to produce the Eojin of the past? King Gojong took the Coronation of the Emperor on October 12, 1897, three years ago and formally declared the Korean Empire. However, the fate of Joseon was in a state of grace. The confrontation between Japan and Russia over the Chosun dynasty was on the verge of a tinderbox. Meanwhile, portraits of kings were destroyed by fire. After hearing of the fire, he was stunned, saying, Nothing was more serious than the Jungmyo and Byeongjahoran.King Gojong was looking for a series of symbolization works to make himself look like a member of the Hwangje Kingdom. The portrait was an urgent task than any other symbol. Therefore, he underwent the largest but very strict procedure to simulate the portrait. The site of the existing seaman exhibition, which was burned down by the fire, was small, and in July 1901 a new seaman exhibition was built on the western land of Yeongseongmun, near Deoksugung Palace. The completed virtue is all taken here. The father of King Injo (part), who was born in the Korean War, damaged some of them. Director of National Palace Museum of Korea, Head of Sejo National Palace Museum, Director of National Palace Museum of Korea. However, the building will be empty soon after the source. Eojindan was moved to Changdeokgung Palace in 1907 by a Royal edict that all virtuous men scattered abroad were kept in one place. The scenes were all scattered around with the last king of King Gojong, along with portraits of King Sejo (the father of King Injo), Wonjong (the father of King Injo), and Yeongingun (the king of King Yeongjo).Since the outbreak of the Korean War, the Royal Tomb of King Sunjin was kept in Busan along with other royal relics. Then on the day after Christmas in 1954, the conflagration that took place on December 26, 1954, unfortunately most of it was burned down. Only King Yeongjo, Yeoningun, Cheoljong and Wonjong were able to recover from the ashes. Whether it is the fate of the nation is ironic because it is a righteous man to be ruined by the war. Cheoljongjin (part). It is the only military copy among the Joseon's Eojin Director of the National Palace Museum of Korea. [Bae Han-chul, reporter]"

A hospitalized patient hugged B and kissed her on the cheek. When she turned the curtain on the room, she complained that the other patient was brushing her hips. The hospital gave him two weeks off to take into consideration the shock of his death, but he never returned to the hospital. There are many patients who are suffering from nursing practices under the excuse of being sick or mentally ill, A said. Half of the students who took the path of a nurse due to their pride in saving a patient's life were sexually damaged by patients and guardians during a hospital practice. The National Association for Women's Health and Nursing revealed on July 8 that, based on a survey of 191 senior female and male students (173 female and 18 male) who experienced sexual harassment, 50.8 female patients experienced it once (50.8 %). Among them, five were male victims. To graduate from the Department of Nursing, you must do field work for more than 1000 hours in the hospital, clinic, or health center. The most common harassment was a deliberate stroke. "" There were patients who were always brushing their hands or thighs during the exercise when they took their body temperature or replaced the sap, "" nurse C said. 44.3 percent of the victims said they had done so. Hug, body contact (30.9 percent) and hips (27.8 percent) were also common. Verbal and visual harassment is another serious situation. 40.2 percent of the injured said they felt uncomfortable when they stared at a particular body part. Many of the students said they heard obscene material (26.8 percent) or sexually judging people's appearance (15.5 percent). 8.2 percent of the respondents were shocked when patients showed their sexual organs to the public. However, only 47.6 percent of the students who were sexually affected were injured and reported the incident to the university or hospital's nursing department. They were afraid of not knowing how to ask for help or that they would be retaliated by the perpetrators. In the end, many (32.5 percent) answered that they weren't meant to be concerned (4.7 percent) or to justify themselves. The study points out that the offenders are usually patients or guardians, but the nursing profession often says they are doctors. A senior in nursing was practicing earlier this year at a local general hospital when she was forced to take a free uterine exam and moved to one. Some also reported that the hospital director touched the hand of an apprentice each time he or she was handed a medical device. The volunteers were quoted as saying in a common note, It was unlikely that the hospital would side with me even if I asked for help. Universities and hospitals need to step up education to help the victims cope actively, said the researchers who conducted the survey.Jorghee becom@donga.com"
"A man who reads the charts for Shin-Hyeon-ho is a man who doesn't read the charts for "" Hot Hand and Gambler's Error 1. "" The so-called Lotto effect is being met by the people who buy Lotto in front of the shop. In the picture, a Lotto stand in Nowon-gu, Seoul, with the phrase ' Winning 15 Times ' written on it. In the film, Sailor describes a classic psychological phenomenon called the Hot hand that led to the madness that swept the financial markets in the mid-2000s. Today we will start reading charts here.If you succeed in the shoot, you will have a higher chance of succeeding?As a result of the U.S. professional basketball record, the "" Lotto 1 "" winner Molly is able to explain the effects of "" low-school effects "" and "" low-schooled senior citizens, "" which are influenced by the "" gambling house errors. "" Basketball fans believe that the more successful a player makes, the better his next shot is, and they call it Hot Hand. Professor Thomas Guillovich's team at Cornell University's School of Psychology analyzed the data of American professional basketball to challenge this question (if the Hot Hand : The probability of a random sequence of events is actually lower, 1995), But when analyzed for season records from 1980 to 1981 for the Philadelphia professional basketball team, most of the players had a lower chance of making the next shot as the number of previous shots rose. In free throw, no hot hands exist, so the record runs counter to what basketball fans think. And the hot hand people who support it might argue like this. "" As the number of the last time they were successful increases, the other team focused on that player, which could actually lower their chances of success. Therefore, hot hand can not be denied by this statistic. ' So this time I was looking at the road, I was looking at throwing two consecutive free throws with no defense whatsoever. We analyzed the Boston Basketball team's two season records [Figure 2]. [4 out of 9 players didn't make it through the 1980s.] And the odds were, you know, that the second shot was a good shot for four out of five players. And finally, with free throw, we couldn't prove hot hand. There are also cases around us where you can easily see hot hand phenomenon. This is called the Lotto location. In front of the dealership that produced the winner of Lotto 1 many times, people are eager to buy Lotto. It is not unique to Korea. The findings of Professor Jonathan Guriyan and Professor of Economics at the University of Maryland and Chicago prove it. They analyzed the sales data from 2000 to 2002 for the state's Lotto : gamble at a per-person cost of $ 2000-2002 ; the Texas Lotto tickets were sold at $ 1,500,000 ; and the top prize was sold at $ 1,000,000,000,000 in Texas for a $ 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. Now, shall we look at their findings? As [Figure 3] shows, the number of Lotto's top seller went from 12 % to 38 % next week, especially when the highest prize money was in order. And the climb effects lasted about 40 weeks and then died out. When they dropped out of high school, the researchers also found that older people and the poor were relatively more likely to be affected by the ' per capita effect ' of having a greater hot-hand effect.And when we analyzed the roulette game together, the error associated with the stochastic sequences is not just hot-hands. If you throw a coin and it comes out five times in a row, what is the probability that it will come out again when you throw it? A half? Or higher or lower? Many people say they tend to think, "" There are five straight front faces, but they're going to be front faces again. I'm sure it's going to be back. "" And this is what social scientists call gambler's error. University of Pennsylvania and University of Nevar Business Professor Rachel Crossen and James Sunchell dug into the subject with the same casino roulette type error and hot hand : the most uncertain casino floor. Together, they analyzed video clips of 139 people playing roulette in 1998, with the help of a large casino in Reno, Nevada. And they kept on saying the same color over and over again, and they tracked the changes in the tendency of gamblers to bet on them. [Figure 4] shows that green and red pay roughly half the price until they turned green three times, but were less likely to choose that color when the same number of repetitions cumulative. When green came out six times in a row, only 15 % chose green. Perhaps it's not such a big deal if the gambler's fallacy is literally what happens in the gambling area. But last year, Professor Daniel Chen and his team at the University of Toulouse, France, raised the alarm when they showed that the error of gamblers had a profound impact on the real world of baseball's problems : two consecutive errors in baseball : the screening process of baseball by a refugee, by an admission officer of baseball : Professor Chen and his team analyzed 1.5 million pitches that the referee found to have struck and hit since the batter had no swings in 2008-2012, and whether the referee's strike decision was affected by an earlier decision. Of course, this is the result of a well-adjusted analysis, such as the count and the position of the pitches. [Figure 5] shows that the chances of the referee making a strike decision on a pitch with the same conditions were 1.5 % less than when the ball was judged last time. The previous two strikes were lower by 2.1 %. The difference was even greater in cases where the pitcher's throw was close to the strike zone and it was vague to judge. The odds of judging as a strike were 3.5 % points (last strike) and 4.8 % point (last two strikes). Even the "" clear "" pitch through the middle of the strike zone saw a 0.2 percentage point, a 0.5 percentage point drop in the likelihood of calling a strike. Hard to believe? There are many similar cases. In the United States, when a threatened foreigner at home makes a request to a court for political, religious, or ethnic reasons, the judge in charge decides whether to grant or reject the refugee status. The researchers analyzed 150,000 refugee screening data conducted by 357 U.S. refugee judges from 1985 to 2013 to see if the judgment was affected by the earlier judgment. Again, taking into consideration the nationalities of the refugee applicants, we found that in similar cases, the probability of getting refugee approval decreased two to five percentage points in the last five months, especially when the same judge had given the same approval, by three point. The research team also conducted a simulation of the bank's loan screening. They hired 188 present banks -- the average 10 years experience -- to do a review of all 9,000 small business loans. Since the data was actual from somewhere else in the past, the team knew whether to approve and repay the loans. The research team is to divide the members of the bank into three groups, where the first group gives a ' flat payment ' that does not give a fixed amount per audit, and the second approves the ' flat payment ' that is actually paid off. Are you curious about the results? Results are shown in [Figure 6]. Let's start with a flat pay system. The probability of a loan examiner approving a similar case was reduced by 22 % when the reviewer approved it immediately before. However, when it comes to having a differential pay system or a strong pay system, it is down only 4.7 percentage points. Probably because the Sykner was more focused on the screening by an economic incentive. Since I succeeded in the past, I will do it again this time? So why does this error occur in our lives? In fact, if you toss a coin 100 times around the house, you can easily spot it rotating the front and the back, but also when you see one side running from side to side. This is very natural in the probability world that the coincidence works. But our perception is that many times the front and the back are relieved, and when the side is repeated five or six times or more, it has some mysterious quality to it. Professor Gillrovich told basketball fans that he had made a shot at the game with a record of success and failure from the toss, and more than 60 percent of his basketball fans did so."
"The can be said to have accepted this result as proof that hot hands exist. Seeing a series of successes, believing that you have special power is going to get you into a hot hand error, whereas believing that you have a set amount of luck and bad luck means you are going to get you wrong. So far, we've looked at several studies that indicate that hot hand errors and gamblers ' errors are widespread. And these errors are seen relatively frequently among the less educated, the poor, and even the highly specialized judges, bankers and professional baseball referees are no exception. In the film I talked about earlier, Professor Sailor's message was a message that ignored the objective probability and said, ' We've succeeded in the past, so we're going to succeed again ' -- whether it's a serious investment error or a financial error.

"The U.S. bombers, B-52H and the military aircraft were upgraded until June 25, 1955, when they were retrofitted to North Korea, and the U.S. Navy's destroyer Communagrad and Leningrad Joint Defense Forces were deployed on a large scale until 1915. It will run until 2040. Small pictures are still used by U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) forces on the 60th anniversary of the introduction of the plane, U-2.K. The 21st Century battlefield is dominated by high-tech weapons and smart bombs. It is a world where one can strike by simply pressing a button and finding the position of the enemy while sitting at the command. That is why the generals in each country are striving to get their hands on the latest model. However, it is unlikely that the trend will be different from the global trend. As a human being, some weapons are still active even though they are past sixty. They are the weapons of long life. A case in point is the U.S. strategic bomber B-52H "" Strato Fortress. "" U.S. defense contractor Boeing Co. said last month that it has signed a deal with the U.S. Air Force to upgrade its B-52H communications equipment. After the project is finished, B-52H will have state-of-the-art communication equipment, Boeing stressed. The U.S. Air Force planned to replace B-52H's engine with a new one as soon as the budget was available. That means by 2040 B-52H will be flying in the sky. However, B-52H is a U.S. air force bomber that was introduced in 55 years since it succeeded in flying in 1952. Chang'ai It has been over 62 years since its introduction. 2040 will be the year when it is introduced. Because of its long history, the U.S. Air Force calls the B-52H a "" three-generation bomber.

With carpet bombing against the Vietcong in Vietnam and is maternal grandfather, father was president during the Cold War the Soviet Union, the order is given by the mission that should be haekpokkyeokIn charge. B-52H is still active and is the main force behind U.S. Air Force strategic bombers. The U.S. Air Force has its own bombers, other than B-52H, with B-2 Spirit, a stealth bomber and B-1b Lancer, which made a takeoff on July 6 on the Korean Peninsula. However, B-1b's nuclear capability was removed due to its nuclear disarmament negotiations with the Soviet Union. B-2 is produced only by a small minority due to its high price. More than 100 years old, B-52H can not retire in the 21st century. Furthermore, the U.S. Air Force can not help but save it because it is cheaper to operate. Russian Navy submarine Communa is over 100 years old. [Photo Wikipedia] B-52s is 60 but there are some who are ' unable to show business cards '. Russian Navy's submarine rescue ship, Communa. Communa was launched in 1913 and placed in commission in 1915. Seon-ryeong (age : 船 齡 · nai bae) is well over 100. When the ship first sailed, Russia was called the Russian Empire. From the Soviet Union to the current Russian Republic, the ship remained a living witness to modern Russian history. After being sent to the Leningrad defense during World War II, Communa was attacked by the German air force and faced several attempts to sink but survived. The Soviet navy was about to retire Communa in 84 but soon called it off. Rather, it received a large-scale opening project in 1999 and launched the British-made deep sea submersible in 2009. It is currently serving on the Russian Black Sea fleet. The U-2 Dragon-Lady, the U.S. Air Force's high-air reconnaissance plane, is also a "" military longhand. "" The plane made its first flight in 55 years and was deployed two years later. The U.S. Air Force in Korea is still using the U-2 to scout North Korea. Sometimes you can see U-2 at Osan base. Choi Hyun-ho, an engineer at the defense and technology magazine, said U-2 is used as an aid to less-powered reconnaissance satellites because it can fly anywhere and at any time. The U-2 is set to shoot the ground at an altitude of 25 kilometers, which is the stratosphere. So, the U-2 pilot wears a suit like an astronaut. At the time of its development, the Soviet Union did not have a ground-to-air missile that could reach the altitude of U-2. Therefore, the U-2 was likely to move in and out of the communist bloc's airspace. So, this aircraft often stood in the middle of the Cold War. In May of 60, the Soviet Union captured the pilot by shooting down U2 with a new S-75, SA-2, surface-to-air missile. The United States had to swap with the Soviet spies already arrested to rescue the U-2 pilots. In April of 62, the U-2 of the United States filmed a nuclear missile base built by the Soviet Union in Cuba. It was the beginning of the Cuban missile crisis, which left the world on the brink of nuclear war. Fortunately, the US and the Soviet Union stepped back. The oldest man on Earth who has ever armed himself with a gun was invented in 1911. The oldest man on earth who had ever armed himself was developed in 1911. The oldest active weapon on earth is the M1911 pistol. The number "" 1911 "" is the year the pistol was developed. U.S. Marine Corps Special Forces or the FBI use M1911. It is easy to clean and repair because it has a strong structure. In reality, people who have shot M1911 can feel their palms sticking. More than 100 years of history was not just created. The M2 medium air rifle was first deployed in 1938. The second best machine gun was the M2. The U.S. Army has not used the machine gun since it bought it in 1933. First created in 1918, he is close to 100 years old. The machine gun is used in more than 100 countries, mainly the U.S. Army and its allies. It is a bestseller on the institutional total. The Korean army uses the 6, slightly altered M2, as a mounting machine gun for tanks and armored vehicles. Hong Hee-beom, editor-in-chief of the military monthly magazine Platoon, said, I have developed several M2 alternatives in the United States Army for heavy weight reasons (body weight only 38 kg), but failed each time. It is still useful to use today, explained the official. The M2 Jangganjoripyo, a pre-fabricated bridge to be placed in the absence of a bridge or in the absence of a bridge, also fought numerous battles. The British army first used the Jangganjoripkyo in 41 during World War II. Jangganjoripyo saved the 1st U.S. Marine Division from the Battle of Jangjinho during the Korean War. At that time, the Chinese army destroyed the Sumungyo to prevent the U.S. troops from escaping. The U.S. military has made its way to the airborne Jangganjoripyo Bridge. Why do they have so many weapons over the age of 60? Choi Hyun-ho explained, "" Although most of the reason why we continue to use outdated weapons is for the most part economic (short of the budget), we often failed to explain why we would have to develop an alternative weapon at a higher cost. "" In other words, "" a good view is a good view. "" Of course, these weapons are not used as usual. Many times, such as B-52H, the changes are completely different from when they are introduced due to continual renovations or upgrades. Lee Chul-jae, a journalist at S.BOX seajay@joongang.co.kr [S BOX], a North Korean military main fighter jet, tram and patrol killer, all over the age of 60, is taking pictures of female MiG-15 pilot. If there is a heaven of long-lived weapons, it would be North Korea. The first bomber of the North Korean Air Force was made in 1948. North Korea, however, is still operating after it imported replicas of the bombers from China in the 1950s. North Korean state media say Kim Jong-un, the chairman of the ruling Workers ` Party, encouraged MiG - 15 female pilots in November 2014. The MiG-15 is a fighter plane that was deployed by the Soviet Union 49 years ago and matched by U.S. troops ' F-86 Saver during the Korean War. Of course, it was a masterpiece at the time, but now it is nothing more than an antique. In the propaganda video clip of North Korea's military training in February 2012, one can see the T-34 tank that served in World War II. T-34 varies the production year and is estimated to be 1943 in this image. The North Korean navy's patrol killer, Koma-class, was designed by the Soviet Union in the late 40s, right after World War II. North Korea's comma class is believed to have come from the Soviet Union between the mid-50s and the early 60s. The patrol boat was originally a wooden boat, but it is being used to dry and worn by North Korea while converting it to wire. North Korea can not afford to pay attention to conventional forces because it invests in nuclear weapons and missiles, said military contributor Choe Hyun-ho. ▶ Central Daily [Facebook] [Kakao Plus Friend] [Mobile web] and JTBC Content Hub Co., Ltd.

"The financial market is forecast to rise once or twice ... The Bank of Korea will raise the interest rate two times this week following the U.S. Federal Reserve System (Fed), which will raise the interest rate three times from next year. The Bank of Korea (BOK) said in a report on the U.S. Federal Monetary Policy (Fed) made by Washington resident workers on Tuesday that it expects the Fed to rise two to three times a year in 2018 and 2019. The Bank of Korea (BOK) said that FOMC members expect to increase three times in 2018 and two in 2019, but they expect the U.S. Federal Fund (FF) rate to be one to two times next year, and one to be only once in 2019. The central bank said uncertainties about the economic conditions, including inflation, remain high and fiscal policies and global liquidity flows may be limiting factors. Although the U.S. monetary policy is based on a 2-percent price target, views are also divided on the possibility of achieving it within the standard.Tax reform, including a cut in interest rates, will add to the budget deficit, which, in turn, will allow the Fed to slow down its asset deflation if the government bonds are issued with a long-term rate hike. The European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada (ECB) are also likely to go into austerity measures, but the level of global liquidity is not yet in full swing yet and is expected to remain high. The central bank also said, "" I believe Jerome Powell, the next Fed Chairman, who will take office in February next year, and the prospect of major changes in the structure of FOMC are also factors that threaten the continuity of monetary policy. "" With the resignation of Janet Yellen as chairman, FOMC is scheduled to have a maximum of five new faces, but it is possible that it would have a different direction from existing Fed policy, such as the recently selected director, Marvin Goodfriend Carnegie Mellon University. The Fed has repeatedly suggested a policy rate hike, and its participants expect it to rise three to four times per year, but only once in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The central bank forecast that the Fed would increase transparency in monetary policies, depending on the financial market and communication, to take into consideration this situation. A quarter point increase in the value of the U.S. Open Market Committee (FOMC) scheduled for July 12-13 (local time) is considered a given in the financial markets. We are backing up the rate hikes conditions in December, Powell said in a hearing. If the U.S. policy interest rate increases (currently between 1.00 and 1.25 % per year), the upper end is equivalent to the central bank base rate (1.50 % per year). Policy interest rates in the two countries remained the same in June with the U.S. rate hike, which the central bank initially raised in November. If the U.S. raises the rate three times next year, the two countries ' policy rates will most likely retract. As far as the financial market is concerned, the rate increase next year will be one or two times. Considering the economic outlook, it is not easy to make a further increase since the first rate hike has not been achieved unanimously. The change of the central bank governor and local elections have combined to make it seem technically difficult. Higher U.S. rates of interest than those of Korea causes financial instability. It is because capital can move to areas with a larger economy and higher interest rates. It is a burden for Korea, a emerging economy, to leave its long-term rate reversal in the balance. As a result, some predict that the Korean economy might have to be pushed around when the conditions are not ripe enough. merciel@yna.co.kr ▶ Report and enquiries (click!) ▶ As the day approaches, the temperature is rapidly rising, with the latest trends gathering (click!).

"A nursery in Seoul's university hospital.A basket of newborns is mostly empty. The first photo of a trend newspaper always makes a strong impression. Kim Hyung-do (36, alias) was the first person among his high school classmates to enlist. She was the fastest employed person and picked the first car she could get. His farewell party, which joined the military only a month after graduating from high school, was so big that even his high school teachers brought all of his classmates together. Due to her military service and social life, which began a little earlier than her peers, Kim had a strong impression of being ahead of her friends. But it was only until my 20s.Contrary to the expectations of her friends, Kim has not yet married first. Other friends took the title of ' The First ', which was the first time getting married, giving birth to a child, and buying a house. Kim also had a date to get married, but as both of the families were suffering from financial difficulties, it was only about three years before marriage was postponed. Kim and her girlfriend have both lived alone, and together, the cost of living could be reduced. Still, the big money needed to go into the wedding process immediately. It has been quite a while since I felt threatened by watching two or three children in elementary school. Beyond the fact that as time goes by, you can't get involved in conversations with friends with children, worries arise about whether you can afford the big bucks that it costs to raise a child. I'm also worried about money to go into a honeymoon house right now, but it's very difficult to think about having children after marriage. "" I was thinking, ' When can I just get married? ' I was thinking, ' I shouldn't get married, ' and I was thinking, ' Well, when am I going to get married? ' "" Kim said.Although 2017 is not all over, there is one sure prospect. For the first time since the census was first compiled, the number of newborns is forecast to fall to 300,000 this year. In 2002, the wall of 500,000 newborns were also devastated by the attack, and in the first time in 15 years, 400,000 babies were left with it. The situation in Korea is not the problem of the day when it became a low-deprived country in 2001 with a fertility rate of less than 1.3. However, the decline in the fertility rate and the decline in the number of 15-to- 64 population are speeding up the crisis for the first time this year. Concerns are being raised that the economic slowdown will start to affect the fertility rate, as some say, due to concerns about the fertility rate and the decline in the population.Korea`s fertility rate is below the world`s lowest. According to the World Factbook's total fertility rate released on December 3, Korea's fertility rate fell to 1.26 this year. It was ranked 219 among the 324 countries in the world. Only 0.83 countries were Singapore (Macau), 1.13 Taiwan (Taiwan), 1.10 Hong Kong (Puerto Rico) and 1.22 were below. Among the 35 OECD member countries, Korea ranked last.Although Korea is ranked as one of the top countries in the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) and one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, the marriage rate is high. According to the OECD's international comparison of marriages, the index of marriages in Korea in 2014 was 6.0, the fourth-largest among member countries. Of course, as the marriage rate continues to fall due to the phenomenon of avoiding marriage with childbirth, the rate of marriages in Korea has dropped to 5.5 last year. However, Korea is still relatively more marrying, given that even among the most advanced OECD countries, the overall wedding rate is on the decline.It is a paradoxical reality, in which a lot of people marry, but few children. Experts are paying attention to the discrepancy between the high marriage rate and the low birthrate. Still, the social perception that marriage is a natural thing to do in Korea has not decreased the wedding rate dramatically. Therefore, they marry and give birth, but they put off as much as possible. Korea's birth rate is the highest in the OECD with an age of 31.0, resulting in a lower birth rate.Being married is considered an obligatory ceremony compared to countries with a wide range of options for living together, and giving birth is considered to be an extension of marriage. The results are also confirmed by the OECD's lowest birthrate of 1.9 percent. Since few couples other than couples give birth outside of the traditional family, the older the marriage is, the older the baby becomes. However, it is common in Korea to have children after marriage, so if you delay marriage (the first marriage age increase), the time you give birth to your first child (the first birth age increase) will inevitably be postponed. As a result, it is pointed out that the low birth rate should be dealt with sooner, and the direction of related policies is adjusted. If you look closer, however, it is hard to say that merely delaying a wedding causes a low birthrate. Most countries have higher marriages than Korea, but none of them are older than Korea's and have lower birth rates than Korea's.In other words, creating a cultural environment that can encourage childbirth independent of marriages could change the trend of low fertility rates. That is why the French and Norwegian countries, which have seen their fertility rates drop, have found an inclusive culture in their various family forms, including cohabitation and one-parent families. The average birth rate among non-marriage mothers is 39.9 percent. In France (56.7 percent), Norway (55.2 percent), and Sweden (54.6 percent), childbirth and marriages were not directly related, with more than half of births outside marriage. Park Kyung-hoon, an economist at the Bank of Korea, said, "" Countries that recover from falling fertility rates are more tolerant of various family forms, including out-of-wedlock births. "" "" In addition, there is an equal amount of housing and other conditions such as wage for men and women, including working. ""In these countries, the first marriage age is higher than the first marriage age. In other words, having children first and marrying them became more common. Therefore, although the trend of getting married is similar to Korea's, the exact situation is quite opposite. That is why the government`s anti-horsepower policy could limit people to marriage age and birth age by simply lowering. The fact that the first marriage age is higher than 30 is not in itself a factor in the low birthrate. Rather, it is the result of the social and economic crisis that the younger generation is experiencing before marriage and childbirth, and the delayed marriage is the result of low fertility rates. It has been reported that it has been difficult to think of delaying marriage as the reason for the low birth rate in order to prepare policies. For some in the conservative ruling party at the time, Park Geun-hye's regime to reform the curriculum in high school and graduated from college move to lower the age group of Others have even. The logic was that lowering the age of entry into society to advance the married age group could improve the low fertility rate. However, many critics said that they ignored the high cost of the wedding and focused only on the result of the delayed wedding. An official in the ruling party said, Of course, the fact that the age of marriage increases only when the birth rate is increased, however, if the birth rate decreases, it is possible to suggest that the marriage age should be decreased.Other studies also reveal that social factors, such as the economic difficulties that postpone marriage and the lack of a welfare system, play a role in the low birthrate. Analysts say that one of the most influential factors in marriage age is parental financial support. The Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs's report on ' financial dependence on parents and full maturity of children ' showed that when it comes to deciding whether to delay marriage or not, the financial conditions of the marriages are high in the process of deciding whether to delay or to marry. The logic that the economic power of the parents ' generation continues to grow, such as the secently-signed "" gold spoon and spoon theory, "" has also been manifest in marriage and other family relationships. The researchers concluded, "" The conclusion of the report is not much more correct than to conclude that the financial support of the parent would help the child get married earlier, or that it would be better to increase the financial support of the parent in order to accelerate their marriage. ""Increasing welfare by providing housing aid for newly married couples to lower wedding costs and preparing measures to improve the economic conditions will solve the low birth rate problem by itself. However, some analyze that the government's measures to establish a free birth cultural environment without the need for a legal marriage could also serve as an alternative to the low birthrate in the long run. A bare mention of the legal forms of marriage and ceremonial significance in the traditional family community can help boost fertility rates. If they can have children, love and responsibility regardless of their marriage, then they should not have to worry about a low birth rate if they have such an environment.While all kinds of marriages are under way in France and Sweden, the typical policy of giving birth to children has been implemented in countries that are recovering, however, is to provide a sensitive support system for childcare that will support housemates. Professor Cha Woo-kyu of the University of Education said, "" France recognizes diverse family types, such as single mother, single parent, and adoptive parents, and encourages the equal amount of support in the working age category.

"On November 15, a 5.4 magnitude earthquake hit Pohang, Gyeongbuk Province. It was so powerful that it could sense vibrations all over the country, including Seoul. There was a first decision to delay the CSAT by one week, and aftershocks are still on the region. The earthquake is also affecting the housing market in Pohang. Five provinces in the northern part of the country were hit hard by the earthquake, and thousands of apartments were put up for sale, raising public alarm. Meanwhile, some say that speculators are quickly running towards apartments that are being demolished by earthquakes. I hope that most people spend their whole lives buying nests will be safe from natural disasters, so it's the same everywhere. But in case of the global housing market, it's not just cheaper in places where natural disasters occur. Rather, in the United States, the increase in the price of risk-ridden local residents is higher than in areas that are not. What is the reason? [Unforgettable World News] looked at natural disasters and housing. California Coast Guard Post crushed and overturned by the high waves brought by the hurricane. [Reuters] USA News] - Heavy water, earthquake, and bush fires sent the district of San Jose, Northern California, into its worst flood in 100 years on February 21. As 14,000 residents urgently evacuated and roads and housing were flooded and damaged, the total damages amounted to $ 73 million (approximately 80 billion won). And recovery is still going on in some areas. Is it just a flood? San Jose's California is one of the most earthquake-stricken regions in the United States. In August 2014, a strong earthquake of magnitude 6.0 occurred in Napa County, which is famous for its wine producing district, and I felt the shock of about 1 million residents in nearby cities such as San Jose, San Francisco and Auckland. In the San Francisco earthquake of the 1906, more than 3,000 people were killed and 300,000 were displaced. In the past few days, a huge forest fire has set out near L.A., burning more than 110-fold of the area of Yeouido and evacuated 200,000 residents. Black and red smoke rises as a forest fire hit the Hilton Sonoma wine country hotel on October 9 (local time) in Santa Rosa, California. Reuters : But San Jose is the most expensive city in the United States. With its head office in the center of Silicon Valley and offices of information technology (eBay, Cisco Systems, Adobe, etc.), the average house price is $ 1,085 million. In addition, out of the top five cities, California has four, with the exception of Honolulu (fourth). San Francisco (886,500 dollars), Anaheim (747,220 dollars), Honolulu (725,500 dollars), and San Diego (589,000 dollars). According to U.S. real estate agency Zillow (zillow.com) the price of a centrally located home, the media home value, was $ 934,000, when it was built on a price-by-price basis. They expect it to go up 5.4 % next year. Intermediate-wide housing prices rose 6.5 percent during the same period and are forecast to rise 3 percent next year. For your information, the median home price in the U.S. is $ 203,400, less than a quarter of the house price in San Jose. Whole view of the central city of Silicon Valley, CA [Photo Wikipedia] housing prices in the risky areas, median housing prices in the mid-rise, above-average US Real Estate Market Research Agency Attung-Index (ATTOM) is the risk index. It's indexed based on the six major disasters in more than 3,000 counties and 22,000 cities in the United States. The six disasters include earthquakes, floods, hail, hurricanes, tornadoes, and wildfires, which results in a total of 71 million housing units being rated (very high, medium, and low). Tornado observations that are penetrating Lancaster, south Texas, in March 2012. [Central photo] 2017 results show that the average risk of a recovery in the U.S. real estate market in the middle It's more than double the rate of rise compared to the areas with lower risk. Specifically, the mid-point value of the top 20 percent of cities in terms of risk, increased by 65 percent, while that of the bottom 20 percent was up by 32 percent. When the time frame was extended to 10 years, the very high regions (percentile 80) increased by 9 %, while the very low regions (20th percentile) increased by only 3 % for 10 years. In short, local housing prices that are easily exposed to natural disasters are much higher than residential properties that are at risk. Statistics use the median value to avoid distortion, however it appears that the trend will be similar when compared with the mean value. Harris, I don't see that much of a natural disaster when I buy a house, are Americans deliberately trying to live in dangerous areas? No way. Rather, the results should be understood as ' natural disasters are not the first issues to be considered in the home purchase mentality. ' Another survey agency, Reality Trek statistics, shows California has the highest number of households in the United States with the highest risk of natural disasters. It's followed by Florida (6.7 million), New York (2.4 million) and New Jersey (2.3 million). In big cities, there are 3.5 million New York City, Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston. Houston residents in Texas, USA, help move flooded vehicles to safety by Hurricane Harvey on August 27 (local time).[AP] Yonhap news. Yes, it's already very clear that the cities with a lot of people, the economic fundamentals, are the cities. It's developed areas and cities with high-paying jobs and residential components that people value -- transportation, school districts, the environment. In other words, people want to live in a place like this, despite the risks of natural disasters. Los Angeles alone saw its population grow by 2.2 percent over the past five years, and the price per pyeong rose by 65 percent during the same period. Now, if you have the rivers and the seas, the civilizations, the populations and infrastructure, let's try again. How did people start to flock to places with high risk of disaster? In fact, most big cities are on the coast or have rivers. Do you remember the birthplace of the four great civilizations? Egypt, Mesopotamia, Indus and the Yellow River all began to move along a big river. It was easy to live by the river to get drinking water, to plow land, to distribute crops that were harvested. In addition, the leader, who controls the waterway and takes measurements, developed the governance structure. Nile River, which flows through Cairo, the capital of Egypt. The world's major ancient civilization originated along the river. [Photo Wikipedia] Same thing happened in modern times. Power plants were built around riverside or coastal cities, speeding up machine civilization and trading and trading via rivers and seas. The invasion of imperialism in Western countries began with the opening of the doors for the nation. So the development of a city means that it's worth living in, even though it's worth living in floods, hurricanes, and so on. Other causes of disasters, such as earthquakes, wildfires. Other environmental strengths such as rich minerals, genetics or rich soil attract people. As Darren Broomst, Senior Vice Chairman of Atom Corporation said, "" Housing buyers value jobs or quality of life. It is no coincidence that some beautiful houses are in the hurricane, forest fires, hail, or flood zones. "" And the cost of disaster prevention, including anti-seismic design, is even higher, so people don't have to suffer from it. If you live in a forest fire hazard area, you prefer a building with fire-proof finishes over wood. In earthquake-resistant areas, they look for homes with enhanced anti-seismic designs. In tornado-risk areas, homes with basements would first be interested. And with the addition of disaster protection, the price of homes is bound to go up even further. For the region as a whole, additional infrastructure investment costs are added, including weather forecasting, communications, and disaster prevention. So cities are more developed. The head of British real estate company Sevils's World Research Organization, Yoland Barnes, also told the Financial Times : "" The reason why a super-sized city grows and thrives on danger is that its economic gains are greater than the risks of earthquakes. "" Japan's Tokyo could not fail to prosper beyond its mountainous security. Children in ItzhumI Elementary School in Tokyo who are seriously injured during disaster drills. What they wear on their heads are hats to protect their heads from falling objects in the event of an earthquake. [Tokyo Reuters] Yonhap : But, I want you to be careful. The statistics above, the housing price, are the standards of developed countries. If you look at the fact that there are no droughts during these six disasters, you will see that they are separate from deserts like Africa and the Middle East. After all, the housing market is possible only with a certain population and the quality of life in mind. And in that case, the high waves of the Pacific will not come out of Poseidon's anger, but they will come in value of a coastal view.

But the recordings released by the Coast Guard were received by 119 after the accident at 6:30 p.m. According to the transcripts of a 112 incident room, not 119 minutes after the accident, the Coast Guard's explanation is not true.

"NASA's "" Mars Exploration Rockets…Let's Show of Exploration Projections…More earth → The first Russian nuclear test launch site requires twice the size of today's space shuttle, and the cost of nuclear fuel is up to the moon's supply orbit. All are symbols of the history of space exploration in the United States. Dr. Ashugada, who oversees the development of Curiosity, said, "" Here are some 5,000 scientists and engineers who have participated in various space missions. We now have a goal of building a robot that will be used to explore Mars in the near future. ""Food Preparation....In March, NASA researchers successfully grew 65 different kinds of potatoes in the same environment as Mars at the International Potato Center in Peru. We are preparing necessary food reserves if we move to Mars in the future./ NASA ◇ Moon and the leading base to Mars again, Dr. Basasa Basada asked reporters, "" Do you know what's most important in our exploration of Mars? "" "" It's the moon, "" he said with a big smile.The United States did not show much interest in exploring the Moon ever since the space race was first launched in 1969 when the manned spacecraft Apollo 11 landed on the moon. Instead, he focused his unmanned probe on observing galaxies through giant astronomical telescopes.The United States is now turning to the moon again. As they set out to explore the planet, they began to use the Moon as a base for their advance to go to Mars from Earth. Getting directly to Mars from Earth requires the spacecraft to be two times larger than its current size and requires as much fuel as it is. However, if a space station is built in orbit around the moon and a spacecraft bound for Mars is built and launched, it can reach Mars at a relatively low cost. Shooting a spacecraft from the Earth would have to burn a lot of fuel to overcome gravity, but that is not the problem in lunar orbits.NASA publicly announced on December 8 that it would test-fire the next generation of rockets, the Space Launch System (SLS), to Mars in December 2019. NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama is actively developing SLS. Marshall Space Flight Center plans to test fire a rocket and eventually launch a manned mission to Mars in 2033.Last September, NASA agreed with Russia to build a new space station, the Deep Space Gateway, in orbit around the moon from 2020 to 2025. The spacecraft and parts from the SLS will be combined to form a Mars probe to the moon. Private space companies can also reduce the cost of launching. Private space agency Space X successfully launched Falcon 9, a single-stage propulsion system using a recycled rocket in March. If re-used rockets become common, it could cut the cost of launching them by less than half, which once cost anywhere from 100 to 200 billion won./ Graph-Kimmin Correspondent, Data : NASA ◇ NASA's parcel post to Mars Recollectioners Center is separately prepared for Mars exploration using unmanned spaceships and robots. Phase 1 is an environmental exploration conducted by Curiosity, which landed on Mars in 2012. The research team examines the existence of lipid, air, and water in order to determine whether or not living organisms can exist in the environment. Phase 2 will carry a 900kg robot, five times heavier than Curiosity, to explore life on the unmanned spacecraft Mars 2020 set to launch.Phase 3 is a mission to send samples from Mars 2020 to Earth. No other spacecraft has ever sent samples taken from the scene to Earth by landing on a planet other than the Moon. To that end, JPL plans to ship a 1.5-meter-sized rocket to Mars 2020. The rockets are launched with specimens from Mars by Mars 2020's probe. Afterwards, the rocket circled Mars like a satellite and docked with another spacecraft launched from Earth to deliver the samples. It would be the first time for a probe to reach space from Mars.Humans need the technology to launch rockets from Mars to live on it. This is because it is necessary to make an emergency escape in case of an emergency or to exchange goods. "" Getting a rocket from Mars back to Earth is at the heart of the project, "" said Kathleen LaurinI, a senior researcher at Houston's NASA space center, "" and if successful, it will write a new chapter in space development.

"Prosecution…Requestion of an arrest warrant for the Lotte and GS bribery scandal -- embezzlement of funds for Lotte Home Shopping and e-Sports ; Jeon Byung-hun, former senior secretary of the Financial Services Development Association of the Republic of Korea, and the Prosecutors ' Office of Korea, puts Jeon Byung-hun, into charge of Cheong Wa Dae's financial aid office's financial affairs budget. Prosecutors have added this information to Jeon's suspicion and tried to secure recruits. The Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office announced on July 8 that it arrested Jeon on charges of accepting bribes, taking bribes on criminal charges, and abusing her authority under the Additional Punishment Law. Jeon calls senior officials of the Strategy and Finance Ministry while serving as senior secretary for political affairs at Cheong Wa Dae and asks for a new budget of 2 billion won ($ 2,500,000) for a PC room support project organized by the e-sports association. Prosecutors reported to Cheong Wa Dae that former Senior Secretary General Yoon (arrested) and former President of the e-Sports Association (released by the enemy) were reluctant to call in July 28, and reported to the presidential office that they were pleased to ask for financial support. After calling Jeon, the ministry contacted the Culture and Sports Council official in charge of the e-Sports Association and asked for a new budget proposal of 2 billion won. We could not reject Jeon's request even though we were unable to provide new business support because the government budget was already set up internally, a ministry official said in a prosecution probe. However, it was confirmed that during the recent parliamentary discussion, the controversy over the budget was raised and the amount of money was completely reduced. The prosecution said, "" Former head of the home shopping business overstepresed the duty authority of senior secretary for political affairs to provide public support to the e-Sports Sports Council, a commercial organization, and a private organization under the influence of the National Assembly's Future Creative Sciences and Telecommunications Commission. Jeon is accused of actually accepting 330 million won in July 2015 when he asked Lotte Home Shopping to sponsor the honorary chairman, e-sports. Separately, Jeon received a gift card from Lotte Home Shopping Co. worth 7 to 8 million won for family use, and a family member and himself received free meals at Lotte Group's premium resort in Jeju Island and free meals. Jeon is also accused of asking GS Home Shopping for bribes and making a donation of 150 million won to e-sports associations in 2013. The association said, "" I will use it for scholarship projects to cultivate human resources, "" but it is known that the scholarship support project did not actually proceed. Prosecutors found that Jeon received payment from e-Sports Association without any basis, received money from the Association for travel abroad, and applied for the monthly salary of the inter-conservation intern and secretary with the total amount of money. Prosecutors requested an arrest warrant to Jeon on July 22, focusing on suspicion of taking bribes from Lotte Home Shopping's third party, but the court dismissed the request on July 25, saying, "" We have no choice but to ask whether or not to investigate whether the arrest warrant is involved or not. "" But Jeon strongly denied the charges. When Jeon attended the prosecution again on July 4, he said, It is not about to be with me or with no idea, if it is with me, I also called on the government to support the same kind of public sector (e-sports) with the same message of promising. The schedule of questioning suspects before arrest (the actual investigation of the warrant) has not been set yet. As a rule, it is expected to be held around July 12. cha@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
""" If you raise funds for helping your neighbors during the end of the year with the help of the CBS and Sisazaki scandal, "" said Huh Ki-bok, CEO of Briquette Bank, an energy bank. It's a word that says, "" Maybe my donation is going to be misused or not sponsored by me. "" And that's how I feel about giving less. There are concerns that the donation phobia might spread in our society after the so-called "" molar father "" scandal. Let's try to diagnose this problem today. It is a briquet support organization for low-income people. Let's connect the chairman of Briquette Bank, Huh Ki-bok, to see if we can get support this winter. Hello, representative of Huh Ki-bok. Hi, Hegibok ◇ Jung Kwan-yong : How long have you been working for a briquet bank? The dining table was opened in 1998. The bank was founded in 2002, so it has been over 15 years. ◇ Government service > People who still use coal briquettes are really low-income people. Right? D. Hegi clothes > Yes ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > This is the place where you can distribute briquet to those people for free. Mr Heggiebook : Yes, it is. ◇ Government service > public support is needed to purchase a briquet. ♫ Hegi clothes > True story is correct. ◇ Government service > How much money do you receive each year to distribute briquet? We have 31 briquet banks across the country. As 31 regions provide about 30,000 to 50,000 households per year with 7 million coal pages, approximately 50 % of the poor energy supply in our country is spent on briquet. ◇ Government use > I see. But how much money do you need to raise to do seven million a year? If you think about the time before the increase, the price of the clothing increased by more than 4 billion won is not 700 won per page, because the price of the product increased by almost one billion won. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong > In the meantime, have you filled up the amount you have targeted with the general collection, so? ♫ Hegi clothes > Although I have made a little difference in the past year, I have always made Korea a warm target. ◇ Government use > How is the situation this year, so far? Your current goal is about 33 % less than what you should expect. But since the support has decreased by 15 % compared to last year, it has decreased by as much as 20 %, right? Heughibok : Actually, I am stamping my feet. ◇ Government service > Why do you think it has decreased by 15 to 20 % from the previous year? First of all, there were various economic stagnation, and then, in the case of coal briquettes, they were put under a lot of pressure. And then it didn't directly affect us, but it did have a recent case with Lee Young-hak. ◇ Government use > I mean it. As I have a voice to worry about, I wonder if it would have been the case. ◇ Government uses > Do many people who donate money to Woori Briquette Bank are businesses or companies? Do you have many people? Heughibok > Personal clothing, of course, is also made into a warm country where companies must make some contribution to society. As a male statue, businesses are receiving a large amount of personal support. ◇ Government service > Half of the low-income bracket used Korean coal briquettes were used during the past few years. Oh, if the briquet bank isn't working properly, it would be a terrible accident. Hughuibok : Actually, it can be a national problem, but it can also be a considerable social problem, so it's been a little bit of a cold for civil movements to do this. ◇ Government service > and the cold is here early, so wouldn't it be fair to give coal to low-income people even if they couldn't raise money? Hugi clothes > If you can not raise money, you should pay by credit, but you should get into winter. ◇ Government use > To borrow money from people who have been receiving briquettes, the briquet is coming, right? You should do it anyway. ◇ Government service > How do you repay the debt if you do not collect the money you want? Heughibok > Please help me out of pocket and my teacher, Jung Kwan-yong, who is in charge of society. ◇ Government use > Yes. I promise. Thank you for your kindness. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong : If you see a deficit, try to give it a helping hand for one to two hours. It's down 15 to 20 percent at the present time, but isn't there usually a tendency in this country to see a simultaneous concentration of donations towards the end of the year? How are you doing this year? Are you really worried, what do you think will be all right by the end of the year? Heughibok : I'm a little bit worried about the current trend, but I think it will form public opinion that we should look out for our neighbors in the media at the end of the year, and maybe we will have some support if things get a little excited. ◇ For your information, please pay attention to the bank and participate in this program. Thank you very much. ◇ Government use > Thank you. D. HughI-Kibok > Yes. ◇ Jung Kwan-yong : I was the head of the Briquette Bank."
"About 50 people in Indonesia who were involved in the abduction and the father of a victim, B, said, "" Don't ask for the kidnapping of an innocent person, "" and "" Don't ask me to ask you, "" and "" Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me what happened. "" A man in a luxury apartment in Gangnam, Seoul, was arrested for kidnapping the son of an elementary school student to return the money when he made a stock investment with a neighbor and lost it.Police arrested a golf course operator, A, and his brother-in-law, A, on such charges on July 1 in Jakarta, and his wife, who was also in Korea, as a partner the following day. All three of them are currently being charged with drug abuse and encouragement under the age of 13. He took the son of a neighbor of A to Indonesia and detained him in Korea. "" As I walked with Indonesian police quickly, I was able to avoid further anger, "" police said, explaining the incident.But over 50 neighbors who live in the same apartment as Mr. A or send their children to the same school as Mr. A said, "" Don't send an innocent person to the other side of the story. "" "" Be known as the kidnapper "" According to the police report, the residents of the neighborhood were defending the family of the person who abducted the neighbor's child.The two family members who were once close with each other are the main culprits behind the feud, a former professional golfer. I had a daughter and a daughter with my wife. The only child kidnapped to Indonesia was an elementary school boy, who lives in the same apartment as A, and a friend of his same grade as his youngest daughter. B was known as the fund manager who came from the United States among apartment residents, and was rumored to collect investors from his company and make a lot of money by acquiring and merging companies. While the A-s and B-s were close with their children playing together, they said to the A-s, "" Thank you for playing with us. "" And expensive gifts were given.Earlier this year, he met with B and told them the golf course project is not as easy as he thought, and he is very concerned about money management, police said. B told A such a story, If you invest in a Korean-listed corporation that I run, your earnings would be substantial. The attractive man handed over about 1.6 billion won ($ 1.6 million) in his money, a stock account and a public certificate to B and asked for investment. `` I will buy shares with this money. If you need cash, I will resell the shares and return them to you, so don`t worry, A said. It was not until last October that the relationship between the two was severed. B was arrested on suspicion of stock price manipulation, similar receiving and fraud. Mr. A then learned that Mr. B was not a former New York fund manager, but he had already entered and left jail on three similar charges. A hurried to the detention center told Mr. B to let him get some of the 1.6 billion won back, but Mr. B only said, "" Do as the law says. "" `` You were so bitter and angry that you were upset, '' A said to the police, thinking, `` I could get any money back if I kept my B child. '' However, he insisted that "" I did not forcibly abduct or harm the child. ""A, whether it was a birthday trip or a kidnapping, was staying at a resort in Jakarta with his second son, B, when he was arrested in Indonesia. His brother-in-law was caught at Jakarta Airport while returning to Korea with his two daughters. All of them said, The son of B followed them on their birthday trip with parental permission.I planned a trip to Indonesia for my second son, and reserved flights and accommodation by myself, the wife told police. His son also claimed to have gone on the trip because his wife had asked him to "" take my baby with me. ""He said his uncle followed him on vacation because he was close to his children while playing with them. My uncle and his children left for Indonesia on October 24 and were scheduled to return to Korea on November 1.The wife of B started doubting the A. Since she heard that her child will return to Korea on November 4, three days later than planned. On October 31, one day before their return to Korea, he flew to Indonesia to join them. Then he told his wife to delay the return flight of his second son and his son, B, to November 4. After changing the airline reservations of the two children as the husband said, the wife said, I want to have more children. Call their dad. He left my hand "" and turned off the phone. His wife, who had been in touch with his wife even though she knew about her financial relationship, was startled. She thought Mr. A would cause some kind of accident. He reported it to the police immediately. Police called Indonesian police and arrested an Indonesian man and his brother-in-law. "" What they have done fits exactly to the juvenile delinquency or the crime of being a juvenile delinquent, "" police said.However, the reason why the A-familiars are filing a petition is that the relationship between the two families was not that bad. The two families are close enough to ask for a large amount of money to invest in their children, and the birthday tours for the children of the A family were already planned by their wives and uncles in August, and neighbors say they were already planning to do so. It is also known that B's wife asked for her child on a trip, residents said. And even after two families got worse, wives were still on good terms with each other, and his wife would ask him or her to "" see what happened to be going on with my house, "" and he would ask Mr. B to give us some money back. Police said the money was obtained by threatening the man, but A lawyer Kim Ga-hun insisted it was just money he received before he left for Indonesia.Kim also told police that the B boy had a good time in Indonesia with the A children. The delay was also made when A, who arrived on Oct. 31, asked his son whether he wanted to play more, and changed the answer, Yes. It does not apply to any of the cases, either. Police say, "" I don't think anything A or his brother-in-law did for a B child was done locally, and the itinerary went smoothly. Even the B child was unaware that he had been kidnapped. Kim might have thought, A can be in good shape to accept the money I gave to B if I had the baby. However, police say arresting all of A, his wife and his brother-in-law is too much of a thing to do, and isn't it an exaggeration to say that Lee Young-hak was the first person to question the police when they raised the case? "" Since kidnapping of minors or abduction has become such a hot topic in the media for some time, I think the police have tried to avoid criticism that they were delayed, "" said Won Young-seop, a lawyer at the law firm.Mr. A's three children are now staying with his grandmother. The children were reportedly shocked to see their father and uncle arrested at Indonesian resorts and airports.The police said, Nothing is wrong but a swift response to the abduction.

"" On July 5 (local time), I was driving into a five-star hotel in Riyadh and armed men blocked my way. Foreign tourists following the car asked, Why is it doing so at the hotel? They said, We don`t open for the time being and can`t say anything about security. The hotel, where Saudi royal families and high-ranking officials have been detained on corruption charges since early last month, has been guarded. They even showed armored vehicles, including the 490 rooms of the hotel, which had become Royal Prison, did not turn off its lights until after midnight. Saudi government officials acknowledged that "" the investigation into the princes and former and present officials arrested on corruption charges is coming to an end, "" and that 70 percent of the 500 arrests were made under conditions. Abdullah (deceased in 2015), the son of the former king, Mutaeon, 65, was released last month after agreeing to pay $ 1 billion (approximately 1.1 trillion won). Now, about 200 people are staying at the Ritz-Carlton and being questioned.The Marriott Hotel, 500 meters from Ritz-Carlton, served as the "" temporary prison "" for officials in the lower-ranking government. As the number of people who were questioned quickly surpassed 500, it was difficult to use the Ritz-Carlton alone and set up a separate prison. A hospital ward has also been set up here to treat princes in their 50s and older who have been in poor health due to intensive research. Asked when the rooms were available, Marriott Hotel said, "" The rooms are full up this month.Officials from Saudi Arabian government are entering the VIP room at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in the capital Riyadh. Saudi Princer Muhammad Vinsalman headed the Anti-Corruption Committee on November 4, arrested some 500 influential princes and ministers on corruption charges and detained them at Ritz-Carlton and Marriott Hotel. `` In the middle of last month, Marriott suddenly ‘ found fault ’ and asked guests to check out, said the princes and other foreign medical staff from India who are currently in jail at the hotel.Reports say some princes and former and present government officials were being tortured in the process of investigating. The Daily Mail quoted a source as saying, "" The Saudi government has hired an international import company, the AcademI Academy, hung and beaten Prince Bin Talal upside down, "" and "" An exemplary case in corruption "" was presented by Saudi Arabia's Anti-Allan.Prince Muhammad Binsalman, 32, who leads the anti-corruption movement, plans to inject the money he received from the princes and high-ranking officials into reform projects involving the construction of new towns. It is planning to pursue various policies for reform and opening, including constructing Neom, a new town 44 times larger than Seoul, as an amnesty settlement estimated to cost at least $ 100 billion (110 trillion). Prince Bin Talal, who was imprisoned, is known to have assets of 18 billion dollars (approximately 20 trillion won) and a large amount of deposits in secret accounts of European banks including Switzerland.The international community is criticizing the anti-corruption movement. The New York Times said, "" The change in the way that the poor die of Saudi Arabia's chronic corruption is not appreciated positively, "" and added, "" Even though prisoners can not afford to talk to their families by phone, they can not afford to do so. ""On the other hand, the Saudi domestic opinion is favorable. Taxi driver Ibrahim said, "" In order for Saudi to grow one step, the culture of corruption must be gone, "" and added, "" The government has concentrated on projects for the working class, including subway construction, with the money it walked on from corrupt princes.

Voices for strict application of the law enforcement course.Lee Heung-soo case shows that the nation is virtually caught off guard by the court's decision to reduce the cost of the trial by 95 % in the U.S. The prosecution, however, had to face up to one year and six months in jail, saying, I have shown contrast to other defendants who were eager to avoid responsibility and helped clarify the truth that is substantive. The arrest of Jang, who was nicknamed the "" aide to Independent Counsel, "" was an issue in civil society. Park Geun-hye is the National Intelligence Service said that the money the government to Cheong Wa Dae's bribes went to play a pivotal role in the process of a NIS ieonsu for Planning and Coordination is physical restraint. The legal circle sees this as a step that is not irrelevant to Lee`s cooperation with the investigation. It would be important for the prosecution to maintain Lee`s testimony in the course of maintaining the prosecution appeal in the future, a lawyer said. In such cases, there is an analysis that there is a "" flea bargaining "" of mining in Korea and even citizens see it as a part of reality. "" Plea-bargaining system "", translated into "" plea bargaining system, "" refers to a system in which prosecutors and suspects agree on a part of the guilty and non-prosecutory cases and obtain court approval. Since 2008, when the trial was introduced and the trial was intensified, the legal and judicial circles have been increasingly required to introduce pleabarging. The senior presidential secretary for civil affairs has proposed setting up a procedure to reduce the number of confession. The Justice Ministry stresses that cooperation and confession in criminal justice reduces the cost of the trial process and reduces the burden on taxpayers. Some argue that it is in line with the concept of justice to give certain benefits to suspects and defendants who reflect on their wrongdoings and cooperate with the investigation. Statistics show that 95 percent of cases in the United States are carried out in a pleasing fashion. The prosecution's reform committee on July 6 also commented that we must recognize the aspect of pleabaging in helping the investigation. The people's legal feelings are different. I can't readily agree to ask for leniency by blogging a person's crime. Most of all, the argument is that the victim of a crime is missing out on negotiations. Prosecutor General Moon Moo-il also said, We need to review the public's needs carefully and discuss the academic and working level further. In the face of escalating crimes, the legal circle is discussing whether it would be more productive to consider strict application measures rather than unconditionally excluding pleabaging. The legal community is focusing on allowing U.S. federal prosecutors to not prosecute suspects when they meet three conditions. When other means is unavailable or inefficient to obtain the desired cooperation, when cooperation is clearly required for the public good, etc., when approved by the advanced examination. Some say that involuntary pleasing needs to be made void. It is intended to prevent the prosecutors from abusing their authority to appease the accused by promising to prosecute him for a serious crime. The fly-bagging process is expected to be shown on video and directed by prosecutors ' internal committee. Some say that when introducing the system, prosecutors and courts should have guidelines for the use of please-bargaining methods."
"[Graphic] What hit the jackpot this year? Tangerine prices are 84 % higher than last year … squid and eggs are also 51 % and 47 % higher this year, respectively, so the price of oranges and squid has dropped as a result of a supply. As squid was suffering from a lack of supply, prices also went up significantly, and eggs also saw a big increase in prices due to the bird flu outbreak.According to the National Statistical Office, the price of oranges rose 84.0 percent in the first 11 months of last year, the widest increase among the 460 items surveyed. This means that the number of students has almost doubled in a year. In some regions, the price of oranges rose from 2,550 won per 10 items in December last year to 4,466 won in February this year. The large rise in tangerine prices are due to a decline in yields due to abnormal weather effects this year. The agricultural observatory predicted that production of fresh citrus fruit this year will fall by about 4 percent to 447,000 tons from last year. Shipments of citrus fruit sold outside of the gate in November are also forecast to fall by 11 percent from last year due to rising prices in January and February. ▽ Marquess of tangerine Production 〓 As the temperature this spring was higher than usual, many unfruitful flowers grew, and many large oranges opened in autumn due to frequent rainfall. As the price of squid went up 51.4 percent this year due to a sharp decline in catch, it was the second biggest increase following oranges. According to the National Statistical Office's survey of trends in fishing production, squid catch in the first half of this year was around 20,000 tons, a 29.3 percent decline from 28,300 tons in the first half of last year. As a result of falling catch, squid prices are skyrocketing, weighing on the minds of the commercial people. According to the Korea Food and Agriculture Organization, the average retail price of a squid from October hit 428 won, exceeding 4,000 for the first time since 2007.Now, squid (Gangneung : Yonhap News Agency) be hard to find fault in the scenery yuyeongjae, Jumunjin-eup, Gangneung-si, Gangwon-do, Korea, five days of squid fishing is extremely poor in the Journalist : donghae in.People are in line to dry neoreono a squid was attracting attention.

The price of eggs, which was on roller coasters due to the scandal of yoo21@yna.co.krAI and the bug spray scandal, rose 47.3 percent from last year. It is the third biggest impression. As AI spread early this year, some eggs went up so quickly that the price of eggs exceeded 10,000 won per season. However, when it was revealed that an insecticide was found on Korean eggs in August, the price of an egg plummeted to around 4,000 won. Meanwhile, the price of the item that decreased the most from January to November of this year was ginger, which was 27.4 percent lower than the same period last year. Ginger is one of the most volatile items in price every year because of its lack of facilities. Body wash (- 21.0 percent) and cabbage (- 174 percent) were also selected as major markdowns. The average inflation rate of consumer prices in the January-November period was estimated to be 2.0 percent. rock@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!) ; according to the Korea Meteorological Administration's report, the 3.5-kilometer North Hamgyeong-do hit North Korea at 3:13 p.m. yesterday. 618tue@newsis.com The Korea Meteorological Administration said the 3.3-hundred-kilometer quake hit at 3:13 p.m. in a 45-kilometer north region of Gilju, North Hamgyong Province.

"[3·2]The Post-China Strategy, and the first time the U.S. dependence on China for export aid is so great that it is threatening to turn to stable economic growth, Vietnam, Indonesia and India. The car unveiled its 165 model, but has been drained of electric cars with Korean batteries, including LG Chem and Samsung SDI. This situation has been on the rise since late last year when conflicts erupted over the deployment of THAAD (High Level Missile Defense). As a result, Chinese carmakers feel that they can not receive government subsidies if they use Korean batteries, thus, they are increasingly avoiding Korean batteries. Due to this influence, Korean companies are having a hard time as SK Innovation China battery plant stopped operating earlier this year.Still, the company`s overall performance is robust. LG Chem Ltd. has a global market share of 103 % between January and September, and Samsung SDI doubled to 5.5 % from 4.0 % during the same period last year. It is the result of our focus on the European and North American markets and seeking a breakthrough, industry watchers said. Samsung SDI completed production lines for advanced electric cars in Hungary with 400 billion won spent in May and LG Chem also recently completed Polish battery factories with 400 billion won.This is how the China-dependent Korean economy can avoid the China risk. Experts say that China`s biased trade structure, accounting for 24 percent of its total exports, threatens its stable economic growth strategy, and that it could increase its ability to counter China when it is less dependent on it.◇ And`s professor Ahn Deok-keun said, We should consider relocating production bases and export markets to ASEAN (ASEAN) and India to prevent the third THAAD scandal.Southeast Asia in particular is receiving attention. ASEAN, a 10-country economic group composed of Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and others, is a second-party trading partner following China in Korea. Gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to be about 2.7 trillion dollars, and growth is rapid. Many Korean companies have already established their foothold. Lotte is investing 330 billion won, and is building a shopping complex in Hanoi, Vietnam, while Hyundai Motor is pushing for an export of semi-union products to Indonesia. Last year, direct investment by ASEAN to Korean businesses was $ 6.4 billion, far ahead of China ($ 4 billion). India is aggressively seeking to attract foreign investment under Prime Minister Modinomics, who say he will boost the economy by boosting investment and creating jobs. Kia Motors started building an Indian subsidiary in July and built a production facility in Anantapur, India, worth $ 1.1 billion (about 1.24 trillion won) in total by 2019.Of course, we can not give up China, the world's largest market. Han Jae-jin, a researcher at Hyundai Economic Research Institute, said, "" China has a wide range of technology capabilities that local companies can not match, and China + India uses general purpose products as a strategy to utilize them. ""◇ MultI-national trade networks must also be provided to prepare for another outbreak of China's checked-sad economy. Economic alliance should also be used.During the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam last month, Japan, Australia, and Mexico decided to revive the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was teetering on the brink of breaking out of the U.S. Tpp US declaration that the president to leave the cards but an agreement in October, led by 2015, the United States at, concerning the point where either. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, however, agreed to lead the TPP in 11 countries. "" The Abe government's push for TPP is very keen to check China, "" Japanese media said.The free trade agreement between Korea and China, which was signed one-on-one in the process of suffering from the THAAD retaliation, was useless. Ewha Womans University professor Choe Byung-il said, If it is not easy to deal with China alone, we should use a multilateral trade network to pressure China, an agreement between the United States and Japan could be a strong solution. Heo Yoon, director of Sogang University's Graduate School of International Studies, added, China can not afford to ignore the Korea's alliance with the United States and Japan.Some say Korea should make full use of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to keep China in check within the international trade code. China 2012, when Japan is China banning exports of rare earths after the disputed Senkaku Islands archipelago wto a lawsuit against the won two years later. The United States, Mexico and Guatemala sued the WTO for unfair subsidy and loans to Chinese companies using various regulations from December 2008 to January 2009.

"[Hankyoreh] Special European Smart City Expeditionals Report The word ' Smart City ' is in vogue. We're talking about changing the city that holds the lives of so many people, but it doesn't work very well for the citizens. I was given the opportunity to participate in the Smart City Master's course organized by the Korean Press Promotion Foundation from November 6 to 24. I was going to tour three European cities, London, Barcelona, and Amsterdam, where I presented my Smart City strategy. The definition of Smart City is a little different depending on the country and urban situation. The European Commission, by using digital technology to provide better public services, by using resources efficiently, and ultimately by minimizing the impact on the environment, is ultimately an improvement in civic life. In the new movements that the people I met in each city showed or told me about, I organized the three scenes in which I felt I could influence my daily life. Barcelona Super Block Experiment MultI-Block : We've got 5,000 to 6,000 people who live in bad air quality areas. In 1859, civil engineer Ildefonsserda placed a building on some sides outside the block and conceived of a garden that anyone could use in an empty central space. Over time, the number and size of buildings in the blocks grew, and the central spaces were filled with parking lots or shopping centers. The roads leading to the Mediterranean coast of Barcelona's Sagrada Familia, the soul of architect Antonio GaudI, were packed with 750 thousand people Saturday evening of Getty Image Bank November 11. There was a crowd calling for the release of jailed leaders who pushed for the independence of the local government of Catalonia from Spain. Earlier, the Spanish government confiscated autonomy from the self-declared Katalunya local government, but conflict and aftershocks set in the region's future. After being prosperous as an offshore empire in the 13th and 14th centuries, Catalonia was incorporated into the Spanish territory in the 15th century, but it has maintained its own language and customs. Barcelona, a key town in Catalonia, was the center of the Socialist and anarchist movement at the end of the 19th century and was a staunch opponent of dictator Francisco Franco. Barcelona's ' anti-osteum ' in historical context was also visible in its solution to urban problems. Table tennis table in the streets of high-tech industrial complex? A new state headed to the Sant MartI district of Poblenou, southeast of Barcelona, early Monday, when it began. It was a textile industry complex in the 1800s, but was devastated when factories withdrew en masse due to the manufacturing industry's decline in the 1960s. It has been since 2000 that such waste land has been revived. At that time, Barcelona transformed the area into an innovative zone with information-based industries, education institutions, and residential facilities through its urban regeneration project called ' 22 @ Project. ' Poblenow was called the ' 22a, ' which stands for Industrial Zone, but now it has been replaced by the ' @, ' or Internet. 22 @ The main building of the Innovation district is the 8-story Building Media-Tik (Media-TiC), which is associated with ‘ Green Insect ’. The streets were quiet and quiet like residential areas because there were many companies to attract. It turned out that the intersection right in front of the Media-Tick building had a wide bench, trees, and playgrounds. On the streets, there is a white circle of paintings presumed to be the children's ' eating up ' game. Little could be seen running along, worrying that it was a case of ‘ an accident here. ’ As you walk along the lane, you can see the word ' Superilla '. A truck was passing outside the sign. A mark indicating the start of a superblock with nine blocks ; no ambulance or non-residential owned vehicle shall enter the superblock. Supernlocks are made up of nine Manzana Block, the basic unit that makes up Barcelona. It is a small village with a length of 400 meters each, with 5,000 to 6,000 residents. Cars and motorcycles can not get in easily. Parking should also be provided in the designated spaces. Only cars with public duties, such as cars and ambulance owned by residents, can get to the area at a speed of 10 kilometers per hour. The speed limit for roads outside the superblock is usually 50 kilometers. The Poblenau superblock was formed in September last year and discussed with the architecture department, students, and how citizens would use the free space from cars. Through this process, a playground using recycled materials was created. Since it was built 150 years ago, if you look down at Barcelona from the sky, you can see that it has a neat square block (113.3 × 113.3 meters) stacked neatly. These blocks appeared to solve the urban problems caused by rapid industrialization in the 1800s. At that time, people lived together in a castle, but when the population rapidly increased, the living conditions had become worse and contagious diseases were prevalent. Barcelona will then demolish the fortress and expand its city based on a design proposed by civil engineer Ildefonsserda in 1859. Serda's plan calls for placing the building on only a few of the four sides of the square block and creating a garden for everyone to share. Whether they had a lot of money or not, they wanted to let anyone live in an open space with lights and air circulation. Over time, the number and size of buildings in the blocks grew, and the central spaces were filled with parking lots or shopping centers. Barcelona City Council mobility commissioner Mercedes Vidal told British-based City magazine, < Citiz Today > in March, "" Among the super-block drivers and sellers, 20 % of Barcelona's motorcyclists are automobiles. We need to readjust (adjust this imbalance) for pedestrians, bicycles and road warriors. Furthermore, we need to restore urban spaces for relaxation, leisure and exchange activities among citizens such as street markets. Barcelona expects to utilize up to 160 intersections as citizens ' shared spaces if the superblock project succeeds. Four super-block locations were designated by early August of this year, and 13 projects are scheduled to go ahead in the future. On the morning of November 18, he walked along the road in the superblock of the San MartI district of Poblenau in central Barcelona. On the left side of the road, citizens were talking on a bench. It is not the latest time that the concept of superblock appeared in Barcelona, where 3,500 early deaths each year due to airborne dust. Superblots were built in the Gracia district in 2005 near the Santa Maria del Mar Church in Gudosim, 1993. These experiments have become a major policy since the creation of the market in 2015. Mayor Colau is a civic activist who has been on a campaign to protect people who are on the verge of being evicted from their homes for not paying their bank mortgage. Due to deteriorating air quality in recent years, Barcelona has set an ambitious goal of reducing pollution-producing and noise pollution emission by more than 21 percent by 2018. If you look at last year's City Council report, ' Fill the streets with Life ' (Let's fill in the streets with life!), you will see that "" We have less than 3,500 dust of diameter (micrometer) and early death from Barcelona (PM 10). Recent studies also show that air pollution is having a major negative effect on the brain development of preschool age children. Other European cities, including London, are also driving cars out of the city, using a variety of policies, including car reduction, more bike infrastructure and public transportation, and a ban on cars leaving aging. As I looked up at a apartment near Poblenau, I could see an open envelope against the superblock project with a Catalonia flag. Although the superblock is growing, not all Barcelona citizens are welcoming the change. In the buildings near Poblenau, the furnace opening was often seen as opposed to superblock (NO Superilla). In January of this year, some residents protested against the promotion of the superblock project. Residents say they are unhappy that my car should be parked in front of the house and in designated areas. Britain < Reuters, Britain, carried out a full report on February 23 on its opinion of superblock, in which lawyer Alicia Avila outside the superblock called the project a "" disaster. "" There may be fewer cars inside the superblock, but outside it has become just as congested. On the other hand, Ernesto Alonso, who works for a poble-based insurance company, said, "" Superblots will change the area, "" and "" the city has to do something to reduce the number of cars and motorcycles.

"A rendering of Samsung Electronics ` strategic smartphone Galaxy S9 Plus has drawn attention. Benjamin Gaskin, famous for leaking the iPhone X image, posted the photo on his Twitter page as Samsung Galaxy S 9 Plus Render. Galaxy S 9 + has a similar design to that of its predecessor, the Galaxy S8+plus, but with a thinner frame covering the screen. Also, the lower rim is thinner than the previous one, so the upper and lower edges are different in thickness. In addition, Galaxy S9 Plus is forecast to have a fingerprint recognition sensor installed on the back like Galaxy S8+plus. China's Weibo user, who is famous for information on new mobile products, released the statement saying that he bought the Galaxy S9 Plus screen shot. In this photo, you can see that the Galaxy S9 Plus fingerprint recognition sensor is located next to the rear camera like the Galaxy S8 series.

A diplomatic source said, It is interpreted as a sign that the United States is stepping up further pressuring North Korea, citing its own safety issues, by streamlining the review of military options on the North and positioning of high-tech strategic assets around the Korean Peninsula. Some say it is China's check. One source said, China may think it can doubt the sincerity of the United States if the United States makes it easy to decide to send a large-scale delegation to the Korean Peninsula while pressuring China to impose its biggest sanctions on North Korea.Some say it is for the purposes of U.S. domestic politics. As the tension on the Korean Peninsula is escalating, some members of the U.S. Congress are voicing their opinions to evacuate their families from Korea, however, the decision by their own team could face a backlash. The State Department's ban on traveling to North Korea after the death of an American university student, Otto Wormbir, who was detained and released in June, is also seen as a reason that influences his cautious decision to participate.However, most experts say that the U.S. team's absence from the Olympics is unlikely. The absence of the U.S. Olympic Games could cause political rift between Korea and America.
