Apartment sales and rental prices are rising in Seoul despite strong housing market stabilization measures, but tenants in southern Seoul could not afford to pay for apartments due to a surge in housing prices. Inversion of rental costs can lead to a "" can rent out "" issue that can not be returned as a result of a decline in sales and rental price along with house sales.Whole view of Dongtan 2, Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province. Next year, 10,675 houses, more than twice the size of this year's, are expected to have difficulties with retro-rental rentals.Seoul Daily DB12 : Real Estate Agency for Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province, Dongtan 2, New Town Landlords of apartments were seen anxious to find tenants. As the volume of rental apartments has increased, rental goods are piled up in piles at each agency. The price of advance rent and sale prices have not been able to avoid a decline.Among the rental apartments, apartments scheduled to be built in March to April next year, as well as apartments that are close to moving in, were also included. As the volume of apartments has increased this year, and with the possibility of the bomb moving in next year, many landlords could not find tenants before they rushed to put out the rental items.In particular, starting next year, the price of rental cars will drop drastically as the company can not find tenants due to an imbalance in supply and demand. This phenomenon is likely to be noticeable in the Middle East and Low East coal regions where construction is still under way. An official at the Korean brokerage office at Dongtan pilot complex said, We have been expecting to see a steady rise in the rental market since the second year of entry into the complex, but the total volume of rental apartments will increase sharply.The entire housing market on Mars, not just in Dongtan 2, is in crisis. According to the Hwaseong city government, the volume of apartments this year was 46,451, the highest for the year. Next year, however, there is a tsunami that is not as good as this year's. Next year, the volume of apartments will be 2743, more than double this year's. In Dongtan 2, 10,675 households move in. In Namyang New Town, Songsan Green City and Hyangnam areas, 6068 homes will be built as well. After next year, the volume of apartments will continue to soar in 2019.The Yong-in housing market is also under stress from the volume of housing it has in. In Yongin, 6,600 homes will be available by the end of this year. Around 2,500 households move in from the Yeokbuk district near City Hall at the end of the year. The number of apartments currently under construction amounts to 37,700. Next year, 16,000 houses will be built, nearly three times as many as this year, and the rest will move in in in in in in 2019. Among the residents of new apartments, Cheoin-gu is about 80 percent and Suji-gu 50 percent are outside residents, the district should be concerned about the rental market shock resulting from the increase in the volume of apartments, said a city official.The price has also dropped significantly due to the increase in the volume of goods. As of October this year, the price of apartments in Hwaseong and Osan were down 1.68 percent and 0.30 percent, respectively. The increase rate of Suwon (0.16 %) and Yongin (0.28 %) was also far below the average of Seoul (2.87 %) and Gyeonggi (11.5 %).Sales prices are also either staying in place or dropping as compared to a year ago. Falling prices for rental sets can lead to a decline in sales prices, which can lead to serious problems. The deposit for the 74 ㎡ lease of Central Prugio apartments in Cheonggye-dong, Dongtan 2, was found to be 250 million won, down 20 million won from the previous month. Fears over a bomb explosion have also led to the impact of apartments in a model complex.According to property 114, apartments scheduled to be built across the country this year are expected to reach a record high of 375,799 apartments. Apartments to be built in Gyeonggi-do are rated as 127,127 apartments (33.5 %), of which 57,957 apartments will be located in the six southern regions (Suwon, Yongin, Hwaseong, Pyeongtaek, Osan and Ansung).Retro-lease rental housing and canned housing are expected to appear in earnest starting next year. Next year, the volume of apartments in South and North Gyeongsang provinces (45 percent of the total population) in the region will grow from this year. This is because the number of apartments to be built during the housing market boom in 2014-2015 has increased substantially.We should pay more to rent a home due to delays in selling existing homes and difficulties in securing outstanding loans, said Park Hong-chul, director of the Korea Housing Institute.Senior Correspondent Ryu Chan-hee chani@seoul.co.kr"
"▽ Gwangju A public school lunch boycott, some students should raise complaints about the effect of Facebook's dinner triggers on rice balls, hot dogs, etc. at the beginning of this month. Some students packed lunches from home for two days and expressed their will to refuse. The whole school did not participate, but the school began preparing improvements. A boycott by high school students called the age of chewing, was sparked earlier this month by what the school offered to some 150 people who live in boarding houses. Until now, he has complained about the poor quality of food. According to a report by Gwangju A-go on July 13, rice balls, hot dogs, leaf mustard kimchi, rice snacks, and milk were served as the evening of July 2. Rice crackers are milk-rolled products like cereals. A sign on Gwangju A-go containing student complaints about meals. The unit price of the Facebook capture was 4,500 won. The amount of nutrition revealed by the school was only 593.9 kcal. The school recommends using its school food ingredients from its original country of origin and nutrition labeling system, which accounts for 67.5 percent of the total intake of 880.2 kcal. Hotdog is a semi-cooked food that is provided with ingredients and is simply warmed up in a cooking area. Rice snacks are processed foods. Students ate 19,49.7 kcal in the nutrition on this day, including dinner. It was a breakfast serving (555.8 kcal) and a lunch serving (800 kcal). That is why students feel inadequate about their meals. The recommended daily intake is 2640.6 kcal. As the situation of journalist Kim Min-wook at Gwangju A High School was the subject of the boycott, pictures of the dinner were posted on Facebook page with the headline, "" A's true story tonight? "" 354 people agreed and 342 replied. As of last March, 1409 students attended the school. Negative comments were expressed mainly : Are you kidding me now, Are you at war, and less than a snack at dinner? One parent said, "" Oh, no, I'm just eating this. "" Post posted by one student, Gwang-ju A, that the amount of food is different from the actual amount of food to be consumed. [Photo Gwang-ju A and Facebook High School] Recommended dinner day 3, narin. .. 810 Some students also argued that there was a difference between the amount of school meals posted on their homepages other than the dinner table in question. Kwangju A High School was then given a banner called ' The Meals Are Unpleasing. ' Despite many demands for improvement and efforts by students, complaints have been on the rise so far, Kim said in a statement. According to the poll, 78 percent of the respondents supported a boycott of lunch on July 9 and 10. No specific figures for the respondents were released. The school promised to improve the lunch box on the afternoon before the boycott, but some students staged a boycott of the meal by packing their lunches. Additional boycott is currently not planned. We will try to improve the quality of the meals, said Principal Gwangju A. According to the results of the satisfaction survey on school meals in 2015, the quality of meals at schools in the Jeokgi-do Office of Education is not new. As a result of the survey on satisfaction level with school meals in 2015, Gyeonggi-do Office of Education was the lowest among 17 municipal and provincial education offices nationwide. The ranking by the National Education Office has not been disclosed since last year. Gwang-ju A was once involved in the dispute. One meal costs 4300 won per breakfast (250 people, less than equal to a meal), 3,800 won per lunch (1,430), and 4,500 won per meal (150 people). According to the basic direction of the school meal program set by the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education for the year, middle schools were provided with 4,270 won (less than 100 people) to 3520 won (more than 1001). High schools that do not provide free meals are exempt from the basic direction. High school meals are a beneficiary's responsibility. The standard of the cost of meals is the standard. Some schools wisely solved the boycott. A high school in Gwangmyung had also received a great deal of information last year from students who demanded improvements in school meals. Students cleared up the problems of the meal program and organized a signature drive to improve the program. Since the opening of the school's subcommittee, the number of meals has increased, and the menu has diversified. The school disclosed the contents of the program to increase transparency and reliability about food costs. A photograph of a local school cafeteria source.

The purpose of the course is to reduce the current water level by 2.5 meters to 2 meters. The two Yeongsangang River boundrymen Seungchonbo and Juksanbo are held at the lower limit until early next year, after steadily opening their water gates to avoid sudden changes.The sluice gates of the Baekjebo Geumgang River, and the Sejongbo also opened. At 2:00 p.m., Baekjebo Water Gate also opened to let out a deep stream that had been closed since the four-river project. Water was pouring from 100 to 150 tons per second, and water gates were opened by the spread of white watercourse drops. The water was also beginning to sound louder. The gate was lowered by 30cm on the same day, and the gate below is expected to be lifted from the next day to increase the amount of discharge. Water gushed out from the sluice gate of Sejongbo at the same time. However, the princess Boa plans to start to control the water level after the temporary measures for the water supply area, and the water gate will be opened after the measures are finished, so the water gate will not be lowered any more today.Changnyeong Hamanbo and Hapcheon Changnyeongbo, which are located in the mid-low stream area of Nakdong River, also opened their gates at 2:00 p.m. The water gate in the Cheonan is to be opened gradually at a speed of 2 to 3cm per hour, and the water level, currently 4.5m per hour, will be lowered to 2.2km by Dec. 9. The current water level of the Changnyeongbo of Hapcheon will be lowered to the lowest level of 2.3 meters by January 20 next year. The measures were made possible by the government to expand the scope of its monitoring from six to 14 to obtain comprehensive materials before deciding on how to dispose of the four rivers next year. Seungchonbo, Sejongbo, Baekjebo first opened the sluice gate and four additional gates to reduce the level of Gongjubo, Juksanbo, Changnyeongbo, and Hamganbo, which were included in the last monitoring list, are scheduled to be opened. As a result, all 14 of the 16 major rivers opened their gates. The stream and the Yeoju beams are exempt from monitoring for opening locks, considering the quality of water and water supply facilities close to the water level.Environment Minister Kim Eun-kyung, who visited the new opening site of the Yeongsangang Seungchon Water Gate, said, "" We will carefully discuss various items with local experts at the end of the year, and then we will decide what kind of report to run. "" We also have to open all of the beams to see what the effect would be if we opened the locks and how they would respond to it. "" So we set up a scenario for each beam, and we set a target, and we set a scenario for each beam. Choi Ji-hyun, the head of the Gwangju Environmental Movement Association, said, "" Because we can revive the flow of rivers that have stopped flowing and actively welcome the decisions made by the Ministry of Environment and the local governments with regards to fixing problems caused by the four-river restoration project, "" but also said the Hydrologic Program.

The brothers crept into the Gunja Car Office in Seongdong-gu on July 11, and crept into Sinnae in Jungnang-gu on the next day, and drew letters "" SMTS, "" which were found to be 1.0 to 1.0m high and 11~12m long, on subway cars.

They said the police came to South Korea for travel purposes. The court clearly stated that "" Graffiti on the subway will not only cause direct damage, it will also cause a loss to the car during repairs and will cause much more indirect damage to the crime committed during the four months. "" The brothers appealed, saying, "" My brother is too heavy for their behavior.

The death toll could rise further as more than 1,000 are injured and others are still in the area of unrescue hands. Iraq's Kurdish government also said it confirmed that four people were killed and about 10 others wounded in the region.

A local Iranian government official said the maximum number of victims could be 50,000.Earlier, Iranian state-run media reported that the aftermath of the earthquake was concentrated in the state of Kermanshah. The broadcast explained that the majority of the casualties occurred in the village of Sarpol- -ahab, 15 kilometers from the Iraqi border, Iranian aid officials quoted. Iranian state officials in Karmanshah said a building collapsed on Iranian state television, causing many casualties and disconnected electricity and the Internet from some areas.

"Bitcone. AFP : News 1 WSJ "" Similar to Bitcone, Tulip, IT and American House Bubbles "" (Seoul = News 1) New Girim : Virtual Money Bitcone will create the most dramatic bubble in human history. The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) recently warned that speculative forces could touch a wide range of assets over the centuries, from tulips to technology stocks to U.S. homes, and recently moved to BitTage, making it more dangerous than speculative.Speculation started ' first with tulips, moved into IT and home, and most recently into Vitcone, ' the company explained. If there is one common denominator of tulips, IT, housing and Bitcons, ' the WSJ pointed out, ' they were all pushed into a financial bubble or something similar to the bubble and ended up collapsing. ' Of course, the future of Bitcone can not be guaranteed. However, as the price of Bitcone increases, the controversy over the bubble grows, making the size and risk bigger than ever, the WSJ warned. Bubbles mean speculative fever. If the price hikes are indescribably high, the fundamentals of the asset can be seen as bubbles. When the price of an asset rises rapidly in a short time, eventually the bubble will collapse. According to the WSJ, the asset bubble, similar to the beatcoiner, dates back to the 17th century, the tulip. In the late 1990s, the dot-com bubble and the U.S. housing market crashed in the 2000s. Now, Bitcone is at the very end of the bubble debate. Bitcoin recently closed at $ 8000 per unit for the first time this month. It has risen by nearly 600 % this year. Until three years ago, the change was only 300 dollars, and six years ago, it was only two dollars. Bitcone prices have risen sharply, especially during the past 15 months. Bitcone prices are nearly eight times higher than the technology-based Nasdaq composite index during the dot-com bubble. Bank of America Merrill Lynch & Technology, or Bank of America, pointed out in a recent report, ' The financial bubble is bigger than ever. ' Even within the financial industry, the evaluation of the rising price of Bitcone is mixed. Swiss chief executive officer, Bitcone, called it "" bubble itself, "" and JP Morgan Chase & Co. warned that it would "" explode "" as a "" scam. "" However, the atmosphere of accepting Bitcone as the asset of the financial market is gaining steam. Goldman Sachs hinted at establishing a virtual currency exchange last month, and the Chicago Board of Trade (CME) announced the launch of a Bit-coin futures package this year. These measures ' set up a market where Wall Street traders can bet on the price of Bitcons and hedge against volatility, ' WSJ explained. Additionally, the WSJ expects that these measures will be an important step in allowing Bitcone to be incorporated into the agency and individual investment markets. However, WSJ said, ' If past bubbles show the future of Bitcone, the dramatic rise of the Bitcone can not be permanent ' and has continued to fall when the price hike is over.Report!

The index shows the level of supply to and from the rental demand, which shows that 100 out of the range of 0 to 200 is balanced with the demand, and the higher the number, the lower the supply, the less demand. Seoul's rental supply index, which has been declining to Gyeonggi Province by region, fell to 137.2, the lowest level in five years and five months. Seoul's rental supply index reached a record 200 in September 2013 and March 2015, respectively, with the index tendering a major shortage. The nature of the two-year tax contract made it clear that the annual premium rate would not exceed 160, not to mention 190. The situation is the same when Gangnam, which is relatively highly-rentioned for rent, is separated. Gangnam's rental supply index stood at 141.2 on July 6, the lowest in five years and four months since July 2, 2012.Kim Do-hun, a reporter at the Construction and Economy Research Institute of Korea, said, "" Housing prices are forecast to fall by 0.5 % next year. "" The Korea Construction and Economy Research Institute of Korea forecast at its construction and real estate forecast seminar in Nonhyeon-dong, southern Seoul, on July 9, that the price of apartments to be sold and rented next year will be cut by 0.5 percent. In the market, housing prices in the metropolitan area will remain flat while those in the provinces will fall by 1.0 %. The photo showed that the price of apartments in Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, for the market of superdoo82@yna.co.kr and provincial houses will fall by 1.0 %.
In the afternoon of that day, I saw the picture of the apartment complex in Seodaemun District, Seoul.
As the demand for real estate has turned to a rental demand every time the government introduces a set of strict real estate measures, the reality is the opposite. The number of new residents in Gyeonggi Province reached 127,000 this year, and the number of new residents in the second half alone is estimated to have affected the rental market. Some also analyze that the real estate speculation trend has led to an increase in the so-called gap investors, and that the index has decreased due to the fact that rental particles have chosen to buy or sell. As the apartment prices have soared, we have already purchased all the people who can afford to buy or sell our house, explained one authorized broker, explaining, As many of them have had to live on hire. heeva@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"The streets of Seoul were the hottest commercial district in the 1990s, with monthly rent of 40 million won (mostly due to the high street prices). The Apgujeong business district, which represented the consumption culture of Korea, is on the decline. It is a result of the sharp rise in the number of retail and franchise businesses in Garosu-gil, Seochon-gil, and Seongsu-dong, which are packed with Chinese tourists due to the Korean Wave and medical tourism. The drop in the number of people who have moved on, but the high rent is also blamed for causing the collapse of the market in Apgujeong-dong. Recently, the Paris Kraza store, which served as the head of the butcher here, closed its doors. Although she has been staying at Apgujeong in the same place for 31 years, the business ended because of the slump in business. According to the industry on July 13, the "" Paris Krasang "" branch closed as of July 1. "" We stuck to the last point of the commercial market slump for five or six years, but now we can not afford to pay more than 50 million won per month in rent, up from the current 2-million-won per annum, "" an SPC group official said. Apgujeong Branch opened in December 1986 as the third direct management store following SPC Group's "" Paricrasse "" (March 1986) and "" Ichon Branch "" (June 1986). As the main store that led the SPC group Paricrasse Brand, it became a significant starting point for Cafe type bakery models in 2003 by rebuilding its interior to the level of specialty cafes. In particular, the Paricrassan Apgujeong point was called the starting point of Rodeo Drive. When describing Apgujung Rodeo Drive, it is described as the street and nearby alleys of ' n ' from the Paris Crassan store across Hanyang Apartment in Sinsa-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul. Since the Hyundai Department Store's main outlet, Apgujeong Branch in 1985 and the existing Hanyang Shopping Youngdong store and Fashion store, Parko Department Store in 1990 were turned into Galleria Department Store, Apgujeong has emerged as the center of shopping culture. As Rodeo Drive was formed with department stores, it quickly became a fashion street. The retail industry has dominated, featuring large sports brands such as Adidas, Puma, Convers, New Balance, MLB and a string of famous coffee shops such as Pascucci, Caffebene and Coffee Bean.However, as Garosu-gil and Cheongdam-dong Branch were receiving attention, Apgujeong-dong began to see a sharp decline. Shops of stores on Rodeo Drive in Apgujeong-dong moved to Garosu-gil. The Music Library, once considered as a butcher with the paricra, was closed and closed down to Apgujeong-dong in September. Uniqlo Apgujeong Branch has been regarded as one of the most popular stores in Korea along with Myeong-dong Central, Lotte World Mouling, and Gangnam Branch. Since its massive renewal in 2013, it has become one of the most important retailers to introduce major project products first. However, the "" low-effective store clearance "" trend led to commercial changes and falling profitability makes it difficult to close its business after four years of renewal and close its doors at the end of "" Hotel Rodeo.

"[Hankyoreh] The woman from Thailand who has been working for 10 years as a manufacturer of Ansung, Gyeonggi Province, was a woman in her 20s, "" Police Contractor, "" and "" Three-something Korean man in her 50s, "" and "" Imported migrant daughter from Thailand was killed and deported by 240,000 Eleven years ago, he came to Korea to raise money from a rural town in Thailand to help support a needy family. He spent 10 years working only with one car parts manufacturer in Ansung, Gyeonggi-do. He was an unregistered migrant worker who entered the country with a tourist visa and sat down, not with a full permit system. So I was more cautious and diligent. I sent about one million won every month to my home. It was almost all but a salary except for a fraction of the marginal cost of living. Work was hard, mind was always uneasy, but at work was bright and sweet. On the morning of July 1, when I was about to return to my dorm from working one night, my cellular phone rang. There is a team of illegal immigrants. I will put you in a safe place. When they are cracked down, they are banished immediately. Chutima, who has become busy, followed Kim after calling another Korean, Park, who has always been close to her. With this call ended, Tsutima's cell phone went out. Chutima's life was cut off, too. What Kim said was false. Around 3:00 a.m. on July 5, Tsutima was found by a police search team, stone-death in a remote hill in Yeongyang-gun, North Gyeongsang Province. The suspect, identified as Kim, had belatedly turned himself in to the Ansung Police Station. He testified that he killed her because he was unable to commit sexual assault. Samrit (56), the father of Tsutima, could not believe the sad news that flew from Korea. It was a bolt from the blue Thai media reported the murder of Tsutima as the main news. Samrit arrived in Korea in a hurry on July 9. "" I was a good daughter who helped out at home with farming after finishing middle school. Eleven years ago, when I said I would go to work in Korea to support my family, I always felt sorry and grateful. I used to make video calls every day. "" But she told me she hadn't called in a few days since she called on October 31 and that she had been disconnected from work. "" I was very concerned about my anxiety. But a friend of my daughter in Korea told me the news.… I'm so sorry. Why did this happen to my daughter .... "" He couldn't relate to it properly. Tsutima has a daughter with her boyfriend, who she broke up with years ago. The 13-year-old daughter has come to Korea only twice to see her mother. On July 11, Samrit the father went to Gyeongbuk antelope, where his daughter was found and buried. In order to establish the exact cause of death, the poor farmer's father only shed tears in front of the body of his daughter, who had completed an autopsy at the National Institute of Scientific Investigation. His closed face was the same as he was 11 years ago when he left home, but his body was cold. The Thai daily Thairas The title was given : "" A Thai woman is horribly murdered in the country of Kimchi. "" Officials of migrant workers ’ groups said that the policy of illegal immigrants based on crackdown or deportation that ignored the plight of unregistered foreigners and the reality of the labor market's workforce demand was not related to the tragedy of Chutima. The detection of illegal residency is considered deportation, which means that we have to make an extravagant choice to avoid cracking down on. According to monthly reports by the Immigration and Foreign Policy Bureau, the number of "" illegal aliens "" in Korea reached 235,955 as of the end of September. The majority of them are unregistered migrant workers whose visas expired because they had expired. "" Many Koreans still look down on migrant workers, and especially in the workplace, "" said Han Sang-hoon, an activist at the Hwaseong migrant worker's shelter in Gyeonggi Province who helped with the tire interpretation by Samrit. Reflecting the fact that there are already many unregistered migrant workers in the country, it is urgent to change the policy to ease and accept their stay conditions, he stressed. "" Our immigration law has rules and orders to induce people to leave the country voluntarily, but they are not in good working order, "" said Cho Young-kwan, a lawyer at the Immigration and Nationality Center. As they were deported immediately after being cracked down, unregistered foreigners who did not have permission to stay in the country were forced to submit a police crackdown and they could not resist the threat of reporting despite unreasonable requests from nearby. In other words, the government needs to provide a policy that provides a way to expel people if they stay beyond the expiration date despite a recommendation or order to leave the country. U.S. President Barack Obama for example, former president, in 2014, at least five years of illegal immigrants living in the United States citizenship or legal residents, a mandated.Delay the deportation if their parents with children and a clean record and paying taxes and legally, jobs and get conditional permanent residency to the immigration reform.Previously conducted by executive order. Cho said, "" Even if we do not deal with unregistered and illegal immigrants, we can provide them with a visa by providing them with a schedule to leave the country as faithfully as possible, not directly expelling them, or by providing them with a visa. "" He added that "" Immigration is not a way to keep a lid on and kick a person out, but a way to bring foreigners in vulnerable positions into the law, "" preventing foreign workers from violating human rights.

"Here, two people. These are employees of Seoul Transportation Corporation, under the wing of Seoul Metropolitan Government.

Let's start with their entry.The full-time story A studied education at university and dreamed of becoming a teacher. However, my dream did not come true easily, and after thinking, I changed my course and started preparing for public enterprises. I also studied business administration and administration that I had never studied for a written test. It wasn't easy, but I felt it was a process to get a stable job and survived. I spent three years like that, and finally I passed the Seoul Transit Authority.A young man who was working on a screen door repair project died in May last year. The government hired a weapon contract worker named ' Safety Management ' to convert screen door repair tasks that were commissioned by subcontractors into direct management. Last September, Mr. B started repairing the screen doors as part of the Seoul Transportation Corporation.● Regular and irregular workers who have worked under the same roof for the purpose of setting up of regular workers, contract workers, and each other's days. They started to work toward each other from July. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon announced on the move to replace the city's arms contractors ' contracts with regular workers. It was not easy to switch from clearly irregular workers, such as dispatch of troops or service, to regular employees, who were relatively more reliable in employment and were also interpreted as "" de facto regular workers. ""The controversy was caused by the "" backlash from regular workers. "" Among full-time employees who entered the company through public loans, younger workers with less than four years of employment staged a one-man protest and protest. They are speaking more loudly using their own vacations and after work. Some of the employees who met during the one-man protest said, "" I'm new to this kind of protest when I'm born. "" They said, "" If my parents know what I'm going to do, it's a big deal, "" but they said, "" It's not easy to get accepted by the conditions that were not so easily. ""They are not opposed to the transformation of contract workers into regular employees. However, they insist that we acknowledge "" reasonable differences. "" The competition rate for corporate bonds is 77 to 1, said one full-time employee who was one year apart from SBS. As the number of students preparing for jobs increases, the competition grows, said the full-time employees go through several stages of written tests and personality tests, while current contract workers are interviewed. With the recruitment process and the process different, there is a problem of equal treatment. ""Even contract arms-workers have something to say. They say Seoul decided to switch to full-time jobs and then looked at the process of labor-management negotiations, which they say led to an unacceptable discriminatory discussion.The weapon contract says discrimination is a lower rate than that of new employees. When regular workers protested the decision, "" reverse discrimination, "" the management offered to make an "" eight-level, "" which is not what the company had before, and make a deal with them. Currently, Seoul Transportation Corporation will start with Grade 7 when it enters the company on a new regular basis. That means even when they become full-time, they start with a lower grade 8 than the new employees.Screen door repair worker Lim Sun-jae, who is leading the strike, said, Too often times, we retreat from where we were. So many things are out of the question of eight-level, and the career of contract workers is unacceptable, "" he said.Military-striked workers have even set up a farm in front of the Korea Transportation Corporation's headquarters since early this month. The process has even led to scuffles with company officials, who are trying to block the installation of farms, adding to the growing controversy as some regular employees criticize them for being "" violent. ""● The two regular and weapons contracts that are deepening, including the resistance of the "" Labor-led Negotiation-Labor-Let Negotiation "" are all directed toward the city. Regular workers blame the "" push for a premature permanent shift, "" and weapons contracts demand that the Seoul Metropolitan Government step up to ensure a smooth transition.Seoul City says it is "" a matter of negotiation between employers and employees. "" This is why critics say ' Seoul is taking a step back. ' The Seoul Transportation Authority reiterates its stance that labor-management negotiations are under way, but remains cautious of making any specific announcements.Meanwhile, conflicts between workers get deeper. As opinions are divided even within the union, the negotiation between labor and management has virtually stopped. A union official said, The Seoul Metropolitan Government has set aside the date and time of the transition on Jan. 1 next year. Considering the administrative process, the negotiations should be made by next week, but the negotiations are not going anywhere at the moment.The government is speeding up its efforts to make non-regular workers full-time, but unlike its aspirations, the field suffers from confusion and conflict. Unless the total amount of labor at each institution's payroll increases significantly, the conversion of non-regular workers to regular positions should be made under the consideration and sacrifice of the existing full-time staff, and the dialogue starts with the goals and timing of which is not fully planned.Although Seoul Transportation Corporation's internal troubles are typical right now, similar conflicts can occur at any time in other public institutions. The government's policy of finding out how to do it by throwing away a goal might end up leaving the hearts of workers whether they are full-time, arms-contracted, or non-regular workers.

However, citizens are complaining because the level of air pollution shows no sign of abating. Citizens are complaining about social media with hashtacks called # DelhiChokes (Dispiration) # air disaster due to air pollution. Their main complaint is over the government of Delhi, a busy county. The state will exclude two-wheelers and four-wheelers driven by women from the compound. However, after the Environmental Court decided that it can not make an exception, it decided to cancel its implementation of the random acts. Politicians are also to blame.

Prime Minister Marin the Singh, who said on Twitter, We don`t have enough money to compensate farmers for the straw burning. The federal government should step in and solve the problem. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who usually enjoys tweeting, however, said nothing about it. Unlike China, which has made noticeable improvement in air quality due to government efforts in recent years, India's air quality is getting worse. Local media also reported that this increase in anger among Indians who usually feel rivalry with China.

The argument was first made on the IT bulletin board, and more than 20 iPhone X users supported it.Noise is known to be generated when a loud sound is played through a front stereo speaker, such as a telephone or music. It is said to be not just a specific model or an iOS version phenomenon.The iPhone X had a stereo speaker at the front, just like the iPhone 8, but it was not confirmed if it would work with the iPhone 8. In early September, some users complained of static on the phone when they were on the market, but it is not known whether it is related to iPhone X or not. Apple diagnosed the situation as a software problem and solved it with iOS 11.0.2.One user at Reddit immediately reported it to Apple, who reportedly exchanged it with a new product.

Rhyu has maintained his position that although his party has constantly faced a paradox since the defeat in the 19th presidential election, he will fight every battle. However, when party lawmakers showed signs of leaving the party after Lee Hye-hoon's resignation and even failed to form an emergency committee, they decided to run for the leadership post. At the national convention, Rhyu had to grab the party presidency by a landslide with other candidates, but was faced with a crisis from the start. First of all, the right party will lose its status as a negotiating group due to the mass defection of its members, so the most important task is to seek solutions to reduce government subsidies and lose influence on the floor. In particular, it is a major challenge to stop the possibility of leaving the party as some of the 11 remaining lawmakers are likely to leave the party.

"○ North Korean Defectors to Be Collected in the Joint Security Area In the JSA, a North Korean soldier defected to the North 10 years after he defected in September 2007. It is a very remote location for soldiers from the two Koreas, but it is not a common area for defectors to occur. Tourists have frequently visited the South and North areas, but no collision has occurred between the two sides to use firearms. There is always tension in the area because soldiers of the two Koreas work so close to each other that they face each other with the chin of concrete marking the Military Demarcation Line.Employees of the South Korean Guard Post went into emergency at 3:31 p.m. yesterday after several shots were fired from a North Korean guard post. The United Nations Command (UNC) was in charge of guarding the DMZ area, but in 2004, South Korean troops were transferred to security forces. Our military guards turned the surveillance equipment to where the shots were fired. We felt in our bones that the busy movement was identified at the North's guard post at the DMZ. "" And North Korean soldiers were captured bleeding and down on the left side of the Freedom House in the DMZ. The outposters immediately reached out of the guard post with their personal firearms loaded with live ammunition, and approached the North Korean army, which collapsed in a low-positioned manner, keeping an eye on the North. The JCS explained that the North Korean military approached the ground to move its soldiers to a safe location, as it could fire further at the fallen defector.North Korean soldier to Be Transferred to Operature-Round : Won Ki-Won Hong Gi-won : North Korean Succession to Sung-Cheon, North Korea's General Hospital During a Shootings to Be Resurrected from Joint Security Area (Joint Security Area) on July 13, North Korea's Hospital It took about 25 minutes to evacuate a North Korean soldier who fell 50 meters from the MDL in the JSA with bullet wounds to the elbows and shoulders of xanadu@yna.co.kr The military personnel approached the North Korean military in a crawling stance, with the possibility of further provocations, a military official said.

The Ministry of Health and Welfare said yesterday that the OECD released its "" Health at a glance "" on July 10. It covered key indicators of Member States that have been imported via the OECD Health Care Quality Indicators project. A report on 2015 showed that Korea experienced the highest levels of stroke and colon cancer treatment among OECD countries, and that the level of prescriptions for outpatients has continued to rise. The daily fatality rate of patients with ischemic stroke aged 45 (cases where they died within 30 days) was 3.9 percent, down from 5.0 percent in 2008. It was also far below the OECD average of 8.2 percent the same year. The fatality rate of 30 days of bleeding inpatients was also reduced from 19.8 percent to 17.1 percent during the same period. In addition, the daily fatality rate of sudden myocardial infarction, once at the lowest level in the OECD, decreased from 11.3 percent in 2008 to 8.1 percent in 2015. It is not yet the OECD average of 7.5 percent, but it is steadily improving. Cancer patients were also treated with an average annual survival rate of 85.3 percent in the field of cancer care, higher than the OECD's annual survival rate of five years, which was recorded at 71.6 percent and breast cancer at 86.3 percent. The net survival rate of cancer in the workplace was 71.0 percent, the highest among OECD countries. The study found that 77.9 percent of the patients felt they had enough time to practice what they saw, and 81.1 percent of the patients who could easily understand the doctors ' explanations were of concern or worried about what they had to say. It is reported that the level of prescriptions for medicines such as antibiotics still falls short of the OECD average. The annual increase in the use of outpatients in Korea was 24.4 DDDDday per 1000 people in 2014, but the average daily dose for medicines was still 24.3 DDDDdays per 1000. Quinolon and cephalosporine antibiotics, which are wide-range antibiotics, are also DDDDday per 1000 standard in 2015, superior to the OECD average of 3.5. However, the rate of anti-depressants treatment, recommended for preventing cardiovascular diseases, increased from 44.4.5 % in 2011 to 61.4.5 % in 2015, and the risk of anti-diabetic nephropatheria in patients with hypertension was also increased. Among the hypnotic sedatives, the long-acting drug prescribed to patients was 192.0 per 1000 people, higher than the OECD average of 63.7. Analysts say that the prescription rate is high at least once, so it requires careful management. In addition, it is expected that chronic diseases will need stronger management. Among chronic diseases, asthma, chronic obstructive lung diseases do not lead to hospital admission by management alone, with the incidence of inpatients stood at 94.5 per 100,000 people and at an OECD average of 46.2 persons per 100,000 people. The rate of diabetes admission was 281.0 per 100,000 people, double the OECD average of 137.2. In terms of patient safety, the post-overlaid blood poisoning rate was 380.6 per 100,000 discharged cases, the lowest among OECD members. In addition, the excess mortality rate among patients with schizophrenia (the death rate from mental illness in general population) was 4.1 percent, higher than the OECD average of 3.6 percent, and the figure for women was also higher than the average of 4.7 percent. ijoinon@newsis.com>"

"[Vietnamese Tears ①] "" Out of the sea, out of the fire … a lifelong limp and a mental illness. "" [CBS Nocut News reporter Kim Kwang-il] In the 1960s and 1970s, thousands of South Korean soldiers dispatched to Vietnam were killed in massive killings and injuries. Fifty years have passed since then, but the pain is now progressive and passed down to the victim of the second year. Cbs No Cut News is a bepyeonghwa Foundation and the Korean Council for compensation from Japanese military sexual slavery for Space History Sale hosted by Korea's responsibility as perpetrators, following a trail of damage to go to 'A Trip of Vietnam Peace'.See back right away that still, too. Writing on the page ① Tears dripping from the hollow of the eyes … After 50 years of the Korean Vietnam massacre, the victims of the Korean War and the Vietnam war were both wounded and left to live. The blood was boiling.◇ Hami massacre survivor from the Korean War (1979) = Tsuong Titur (79), a Vietnamese journalist, met with the Peace and Tourism Corps at the Prosecution`s Homeful Memorial on July 4.Even in a meeting on July 4 when the group visited, Tsiong Titu could not even make eye contact with reporters. The day when the Korean soldiers killed their families and crippled themselves is not vivid enough, as the damage still remains on them and their children. Tsung Titu is said to have stayed at home with his youngest daughter, who was three to four months old, because the soldiers, called Taihan (Daehan), did not take the three women out to one side of the town, but they gave birth shortly after. Then suddenly some soldiers who had come into the house began shooting out of nowhere. His eldest daughter (7), son (4), second sister of Tsiong Titu, one Olke, and seven nephews were suddenly turned into chilly bodies. After the attack, the soldiers immediately set fire to themselves. Tsung Titu, who wore special shoes on one side (photo : independence PD), was bleeding all over and had to take off with his youngest daughter and run away in a hurry. The pain in the broken ankle lasted 50 years. She can not walk without helping out with her special shoes. The youngest daughter, who was held in his arms, also spent her whole life limping. "" This time, the child was very shocked and mentally ill, "" Tsiong Titu said. I had to live with mental illness unlike other children, she said. ◇ Family members all wept over the massacre ... and were led by the late Palmathihoa, the son of Korean soldiers who survived the massacre, and by Korean soldiers during the shooting spree. Most of them were women, young children, and old people who were sacrificed without even knowing. About a week later, when Korean troops left the village, the bodies of 135 residents were found horribly damaged. Some were trampled by bulldozers, and the flames had turned into ash. Only a few survivors and residents of nearby villages had collected scattered flesh and bone fragments.She lost six members of her family, including a 5-year-old sister, who managed to escape being attacked in another town during the massacre. His mother, Paltihoa, says she was barely saved from the scene, but she lost both ankles and died in 2013 at the age of 87. Misfortune has eaten into the family. They lost their eyes to the fire while clearing up their home soil that had turned into a wasteland after the war. As tears fell from one eye, she said, I really hated the Korean soldiers and lived in a rage, and now I don`t think I should forgive them. ◇ Massive pain … No parents, no brothers, no food, and no food poisoning. ¡ ° Nguyen ThI Tan (57), a survivor of the Pongnyang massacre, was found in the southern town of Cho Woo-hye and Hanbeng, a resident of Hanbeng Peace Foundation on February 12. U.S. Army headquarters in October and Vietnamese authorities suspect that a Marine Corps unit killed the young man passing through town.When the six children were playing in the yard, they hid in a small cave with a depth of 1m and a breadth, but were immediately caught and had to be shot all over. Nguyen ThI-tan (57), who was eight years old at the time, escaped with a bulging intestine outside her belly and was rescued by the U.S. army. His brother died with his mouth dead and his children were shot and stabbed immediately. The mother was later found in a heap of corpses at the mouth of the village. Although they did not meet face-to-face due to deteriorating local weather conditions, they were told by one Bepyeonghwa Foundation that "" rain can create a tremendous pain in the site of a bullet wounds. "" "" It was so hard to live without my parents and siblings, "" he said painfully about his life, which he had never done before : go to a kitchen garden and carry bricks from the construction site. He especially blamed her for her long life.Vietnamese Central (photo : Kim Kwang-il), who was hit by a typhoon earlier this month and flooded with water, saw an estimated 80 Korean Army murders during the Vietnam War and 2,000 in all. Han Bepyong, executive director of the foundation Koo Soo-jung, said, "" If it comes to the case of the "" new slumming list of murders, it's not twice as much as the one announced in 2000.

Apple's iPhone 8 was released in Seoul Plaza, but its smartphone effect has decreased by about 30,000 items. Analysts say that the iPhone 8's initial performance was sluggish, and the demand for its 10th anniversary model, the iPhone X, is on the rise as it is scheduled to be released on July 24. According to the mobile industry on July 13, the average number of mobile phone transfers between July and November 11 was 10,9253. This is not much different from the 10,844 number of the average number of bacteria that moved on October last year when the number of days of computer ownership was decreased due to the Chuseok holiday. The effect of the iPhone's launch was modest, according to reports. As of November 1 to 2, when the iPhone 8 was about to be released, the average number of phone transfers was only about 13,000. Then, the total number of phone movements during the last 3-4 days of the iPhone 8 launch soared to 64,480. The average number of moves per day was 39,907, exceeding the 24,000 mark set by the regulator, which is called market overheating. But the number shift market rallied briefly on the first weekend of the iPhone 8 release and then subsided. The average number of transfers to other countries decreased to 28,875 on Sunday, when the nation's computer system was unable to open until Sunday. In particular, the combined number of mobile phone movements during the four days from 8th to 11th when the iPhone X domestic release date was announced decreased to 72,929, with the average number of mobile phones to 17,723. Analysts say the decline in the number shift is due to the fact that the popularity of the iPhone 8 is not the same as usual. "" There was a problem with battery malfunction before the release of the iPhone 8 in Korea, and consumers clearly decreased during their early stages of purchase due to the fact that the difference between the original product and the original product was difficult to make, "" said an official from the mobile industry. It also explained that consumers ' anticipation and wait for the iPhone X, Apple's simultaneous release of its 10th anniversary iPhone 8, was strong. The iPhone X is the first Apple smartphones to adopt a "" bezel lease "" design that includes an Organic Light-planned Diode (OLED) display and minimizes the left and right margins of the display. In addition, it received attention for its application of face recognition type face ID, except for fingerprint recognition, which is the key technology of the iPhone. The iPhone X was first released to major countries including the United States and Japan on July 3 and is scheduled to land in Korea on July 24. Prior to this, the three mobile service operators will sell their tickets from July 17 to 23. IPhone X is the most expensive smartphone ever released in Korea, priced at 64GB 1.14 million won and 252GB 1.63 million won. However, some say that the recent series of defective iPhone X products could discourage users from purchasing. Foreign media including Mac Lumus and Business Insider say the iPhone X recently released an iPhone X with a green vertical line on the left and right of the display, and its so-called Green Line Issue, with a cold, failed ID : We expect the initial supply of the iPhone X will be weaker than other products, prompting customers to hold higher sales and combine them, industry watchers said.

"- Three times to refuse police summons for foreign treatment. - A warrant is being issued at the airport upon arrival. Regarding Kim, who left for the United States on treatment, police announced that they would enforce a warrant at the airport upon his return home.The Seoul Suseo Police Station, which is investigating the incident, announced on July 13 that it would request for an arrest warrant for the former chairman as soon as possible. The police asked for a warrant for Kim's arrest because he has refused to attend three times due to his departure. On July 8, Kim submitted a petition to the police, saying, "" I can not attend the meeting because I have to deal with the disease. ""Kim has not yet returned home since leaving for the United States last July to seek medical care for recruits. Kim told police, It is a long time to treat and an unstoppable situation, and the treatment is expected to take place as early as February next year.Police plan to enforce the warrant when Kim arrives at the airport. We will review cooperation for local arrests, including Interpol, when a warrant for the arrest is issued, police officials said.Kim's secretary, a from July to February, Mr. Kim had been sexually molested as a habitual offender from Kim sued the police. Kim resigned from the post two months after the lawsuit against him over alleged sexual harassment.osyoo@heraldcorp.com The rats wore a bell machine on their heads like hats. It is an optical device that stimulates the brain of mice by firing lasers. The black rat in the rerap sniffs around. Lee Jin-hyung, professor of biotechnology at Stanford University, pressed a button on a device connected to mice and wires. The black machine let out a blue light, and suddenly the mouse started spinning clockwise. When I set the buttons to work again, the mice danced counterclockwise this time. The laser stimulated a particular part of the brain (stristratum), which allowed the rats to move as they wished. The world of sense that used to be the realm of God has entered the field of human research and is being used in various fields. The brain acts as a CPU or memory when it is computerized. Five senses ' accepted data are calculated and stored. The background of sprinter Usain Bolt's 100 meters in 9.58 seconds is the cerebellar peduncle, which directs thigh movements. Theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, who solved the mystery of the universe little by little, owes it to the brain that is in charge of advanced thinking. If you control the brain, you actually control everything. The black rat in Lyrab handed over body control because of brain control. For rats, Professor Lee is God and all his angels. Advanced nations such as the United States, Europe and Japan are investing enormous sums of money in brain research. When the secrets of the brain are solved, many problems are solved one after another like sweet potato stem. Brain research is a difficult black box, said Jeong Jae-seung, head of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, who believes understanding the way the brain works can solve a number of difficult problems. For example, patients with paralyzed thighs can recover from exercise when the cerebellar brain functions are restored. When a patient loses his or her speech and the frontal lobe functions, it overcomes aphasia. There is also a cure for various kinds of brain diseases such as dementia, depression and stroke. Human abilities can be upgraded. Physical limitations can be overcome by interacting with the brain with wearable devices. There is also the possibility of the creation of a kind of ' suit iron ' that strengthens the human muscle and protects the body from external shocks. International Joint Research Team at Washington University in July 2016 and Oxford University in the United Kingdom can divide the cortex into 180 regions, and brain mapping, University of Washington, D.C., to organize the functions of each region AI may open the way to enhancing memory and communication skills. Already, Facebook and Neurallink are developing brain computing technologies to prepare for the AI era. It is also possible to find a turning point in the economy. Car manufacturers, for example, detect the driver's brain waves to prevent sleepiness and drunk driving. Smartphones makers recommend images for relaxation by measuring the amount of a certain neurotransmitter (dopamine) in their brain. Brain control that induces a specific frequency (Hz) to maintain concentration the day before the test may also be output. Already, P&G ; Uniraber are using responses from the consumers ' brains to market when watching their products or ads. There are also Korean scientists who are at the forefront of brain research. Lee Jin-hyung (40) is a lifetime professor at Stanford University's Department of Bio-engineering. Professor Lee is currently developing a medicine for cerebral epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. Kang Bong-kyun, head of the Council for Brain Studies at Seoul National University, said, "" If nuclear power has control of the 20th century, the 21st century will actually replace it. "" The world will conquer the brain. San Francisco = reporter reporter @onga gaongang.co. krs."
