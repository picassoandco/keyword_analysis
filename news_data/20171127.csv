The photo shows an ant waist covered with A4 paper last year, and this time it is called a skinny body. Nine Gag, an online content sharing site, released a video clip spreading on Weibo. In the video, women get between two floor bedsheets and ladders. If one passes the examination after positioning oneself, one can be recognized as a skinny person. The women in the video easily passed through a narrow gap. Internet users who saw the video were criticized for being free to authenticate and for being too cosmetic. There are many criticisms that the popular "" portrait "" game in China is a side effect of "" appearances on the world. "" The waist certification of ants, the body certification of a thin neck, the deep clavicle certification, and the narrow leg certification (which covers the legs with an iPhone) all want to show off their looks. Other critics say that the skinny body is healthy. Though a slim figure can be a standard of beauty, being thin is not necessarily a beautiful thing and one does not know whether it will lead to a healthy life. Weibo is in the middle of a ' certification game ' today, although a series of criticisms keep on happening. Of the 10 places I have inquired, only two are available for reservation. Eight out of ten people say, "" I have a full reservation because I have a foreign group. "" or "" I have yet to get a reservation "" Coincidentally or not, there wasn't a single place to reserve at the Gangneung area. At least two places to stay in Pyeongchang were also charged two to three times higher than the peak season by setting up a fare system called the Olympics during the previous off-season, quasI-supletive, peak and peak season.The opening and closing of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and the nearby Hoenggye-ri area of the Winter Paralympics Even during the peak of the play, the price of a 12-pyong double room, which costs 179,000 won, went up to 448,000 won and the price of a 60-pyong room, which can hold up to 13 people, reached 1,780,000 won. The head has sloped to a side. When the complaints were raised, employers blurted out that `` it was too expensive … '' It was apparent that the government could not disclose its intention to make excessive profits on foreigners who were not familiar with the local situation. The same goes for the Gangneung Public Office Information System, designed to match Olympic guests who can not get accommodation in Gangneung city with excess vacancies. If you press down on the prices of the stores registered in this system, the lowest and highest prices of the rooms during the Olympics are available. The highest price was restricted to receiving 500,000 won or more, but when asked, they demanded higher rates than the prices raised. Because the reservation status was not changed to the latest information, he asked about the reservation status and was turned down by his request. The public office information system, which should serve as a stepping stone for connecting guests and accommodation, is not functioning properly. Booking sites at accommodations were also relatively small, with prices still at 300,000 to 600,000 won per day. Very occasionally, the "" conscientious "" zone, which costs around 200,000 won, was only noticeable as if it were rare.The logic of owners of the accommodation facilities in Gangneung, near Gyeongpo is based on the high rates of supply and demand. Demand is driving up the price of the market, but this is not the way to look at it. There is a bubble in the expectation that "" there should be a demand, so I can get this "" and "" I've invested in a facility to receive foreign guests. "" In fact, some local accommodations have not even received a request concerning foreign reservations, and the province estimates that the rate is only 30 percent. Gangwon-do, Pyeongchang-gun and Gangneung are trying to persuade their employers by going to restaurants with exorbitant prices to attract them to the right price, but they can not afford to impose strict regulations on them. These local governments are concerned that they could experience public spaces if they wait for long-term foreign guests with vague expectations. The city behind it is equipped with good accommodation for around 100,000 won and can move to the Seoul Metropolitan area if you consider the fare, distance, and time of the Seoul-Dongnung KTX, which is scheduled to open on July 15. Excessive room rates are one of the factors contributing to the ticket sales.In response, Gangwon Province has assembled owners three times since October and has continued to explain its concerns about fair price and fair air space. It will soon form an integrated call center to prevent foreigners from being exposed to rip rates and connect them with owners who are not good at Internet use. The city of Gangneung, Gangwon Province, will form a task force to root out rip-off fares starting next month. TF keeps monitoring accommodation not registered in the public office information information system in Gangneung, and accommodation demanding excessive fees, and also inspects the Building Act, the Housing Improvement Act, and the Public Health Act, and fire prevention facilities. Although the government intends to crack down on possible administrative measures other than possible price regulations, it is uncertain how effective the measures will be. An official at the Olympic Food and Drug Administration in Gangwon said, "" Excessive fare charges will only reduce the image of tourism by themselves. "" "" We have to fix proper accommodation rates in the near future to block the rooms. ""RT3 Olympic Reservations Reservations Reservicement Account Reservations Rate Cona.co.CRe A Conanys Rentribution-Private Rate Of Redemption and Inquirements (Click!) ▶ The Yonhap News Channel Reset Rate of Redention When lending is frozen, rental profit is almost far below expectations. Critics point out that the adoption of RTI will divide even rental businesses into "" rich and poor, "" and consider the multI-priced owners to be speculators.Beginning next March, banks will question real estate rental operators whether RTI is 1.25 times more likely to be lent to their homes and whether non-residential apartments or motels are 1.5 times larger. RTI is the annual rental income of a tenant divided by interest costs. The higher the RTI is, the better the profitability of rental businesses. Renters whose RTI fails to meet the threshold will be cut.According to the Financial Supervisory Commission, 21.2 percent of rental real estate loans from 2014 to September fell short of the above standards, while 28.5 percent of non-residential loans fell short of the above standards. The authorities said, "" If banks make separate comments on the screening process, they can make a loan even if they fail to meet RTI standards, "" but added, "" The market believes it is virtually impossible to make a loan based on loan regulations.The problem is that the loan restrictions could encourage the "" rich and poor "" among the borrowers. Well-funded businesses can buy new property and generate new lease revenues, even if they do not receive a lot of loans, so they can improve their RTI even more. On the other hand, those who can buy real estate and keep rent only when loans are available, can not create new revenue sources when RTI regulations are established. There are also concerns that RTI may cause monthly hikes in some areas.One real estate broker said, "" RTI is based on how much loans and monthly rent the rental owner took out, and the rent was built to match the deposit size or market price, "" but "" the rent was initially large enough to cover the rent. ""Critics say that multiple home owners are considered to be the only ones subject to regulation.A rental operator who has two small apartments since retirement said, "" I can't conscientiously afford to register as a businessman and pay high premiums for local health insurance.kate01@heraldcorp.com"
"If you just get past taxi seniors in your daily life, and you want to stop them in the back of the bus, and the elderly don't know what to do. But five taxis just passed by. Gwangju : Free of charge Oh Jong-chan (81.) picked up a taxi late last month on a street in Gwangju. After having an operation for spinal canal stenosis, Lim relies on her staff to raise her hand. India and the car stood on their jaws to take a taxi, but five cars just passed. He had to raise his hand. Still, he was caught four times after his three years. Jeong Gyu-hyang (81, female), who was denied the ride in the same spot, said, I asked why don't I stop for a taxi driver? He did not report it even though he was not on board, ' he said angrily. Park Byeong-seon (75, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul) often goes to coffee shops to have a social gathering and often has an absurd experience. The employees, the managers, and others are not welcome. "" I once asked for a cup to share less coffee than the number of people, but I never gave it to anyone. The server whispered, "" If there are too many seniors, young people won't come. "" "" If there are too many seniors, I can hear them all. "" And the joke is, "" After a dog is home, there is a dog is a half way home. "" Due to the rapidly aging population, people over the age of 65 entered the "" Age of Overtaking "" in November last year, when they were younger than their youth (age 0-14). In August this year, the elderly population based on the resident registration population became elderly, accounting for more than 14 percent of the population. How ready will Korean society be in the era of the elderly? The Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs surveyed 10,451 elderly citizens in 2015 and found that 7.1 percent experienced discrimination. The more ageist the age, the more alienated the elderly become, the more they think about suicide. Did 7.1 percent of them experience discrimination? The JoongAng Ilbo interviewed 26 elderly people in depth at senior citizens ' centers, Tapgol Park, and hospitals. Older adults complained of discrimination not only in their daily lives but also in their homes. Q : The most frequent discrimination is "" How many elderly people go home to work, "" on the bus, in Seoul, and "" I don't think you'll feel sick later. "" (Bus driver) I got on the bus slowly because my legs were sore, and I was verbally abused by an engineer. Park said, "" If you ride an old man, you should understand that the driver ' steps up slowly. ' A word makes a sword Still leaves a scar. The bus driver shouted, "" Take your luggage and go back with you, "" while sitting in the front seat with your luggage. A man named Park (92, Yeon-o, and Seongbuk-gu) stands in front of the door when he takes a bus. I don't think it would be comfortable for the person who sat in front of me. Call from a distance and give up your seat, and you will go and sit. Recently, a passenger told elementary school students sitting down to give up their seat to an old man, and she was thrilled to see that they were arguing, "" We paid the same as you. "" The elderly pass through the ticket gates at Jongno 3-ga Station in Seoul. Choi Jeong-dong, a reporter on the subway was shot by a person who was shown with a card in the opposite direction. The station workers openly ignored what happened to the elderly. Kim Hong-min (77, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul) had a hard time when she returned from her parents ' home in Bundang. Some young people were asked to take the Bundang train to Wangsimni, but they did not fully inform them of it. The other young man told me, but it was not helpful to simply go away. Eventually, he gave up on Bundang Line and took the previous line (Line 3). A walk-handled woman named Lim Jong-ae stands to catch a taxi on a Western street in Gwangju. As the taxi left, it was too late to catch even him until he was three. Gwangju : Freelance Oh Jong-chan (87, Lee, and Yongsan districts) says that Kim Gwan-ae walks by with an elderly man to catch a taxi at a market in Gyeongdong, Dongdaemun-gu. As soon as they passed, there were several cases of young customers being carried away. "" One gets out, takes a taxi, the other hides out, and when the car comes out, it gets in, "" says Kim. Kim (89, Yeon-yi and Seongbuk-gu) can not go anywhere by himself. We can`t get taxis. It is not easy to meet children, either. It was too dirty because I was sick. In addition, it is not uncommon for Cha Joon-hong, a reporter at Hee Restaurant, a park, and a market place to sit in the corner, avoiding the middle of the restaurant. If you sit in the middle, the waiter comes and experiences several times that you asked him to go next door, and then from the beginning he goes to the corner. Sung said bitterly, I don't think it would affect my business if the elderly sat in the middle of it. Kim Byung-kook (82, Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul) said, I will go to a cafe on the second floor of a bakery in Gangnam, Seoul. We only have young people here, ' he says. If you go to a park and are embarrassed because you feel uncomfortable, you openly ignore ' why an old man like that walks out and does that. ' We are too much of a victim of this, so we disregard it. Older People Sitting at Tapgol Park in Jongno-gu, Seoul [Central Photo] Meeting at Namdaemun Market on July 22, Kim (75) was indignant as he confessed his experiences in early October. I was picking out my grandchildren's jewelry clothes when a Chinese tourist flocked there. The owner of the restaurant said, "" Grandmother, are you going to do this or not? "" And the owner did not even look at it. "" Older people are likely to be ignored because they often do not live while looking around, "" Kim says. Differentiated for its slow movement, Dr. Kim Joo-hyun of Seoul National University interviewed 27 elderly citizens in depth in 2015. "" Older people tend to stay away from people, saying, ' It smells like it, ' "" one 70-year-old woman said. Another woman in her 70s saw discrimination when she was being educated at a community center. `` Older people are slow to move, '' he said. "" Then I need to understand and wait, "" she said, "" Oh, raise your hand, "" and she gets irritated.

"" Since then, they haven't talked about the senior citizens ' center. She doesn't even tell her husband. The face of an old man who lives alone in Goyang City, Gyeonggi Province. Many elderly people are discriminated against by their nearest family. [Central Photo] Park Hyung-woo (western Gwangju City) was recently excluded from deciding on the details of his grandson's engagement. Normally making decisions on the basis of family matters, however, recently our grandson is quoted as saying, "" We are getting married without a wedding. Grandpa is not familiar with these weddings, is he? At least I can give advice, but I feel left out because I don`t speak in the first place, Park said. A woman in her 70s said in a Seoul National University survey, "" Mom doesn't have to know that. But you're curious. We're always curious to know. And we can't understand them quickly, so we didn't answer them two or three times. That is to ignore me. An alternative to the expert's eye on older adults is getting ready for education and an alternative to discrimination against the elderly. Han Jeong-ran, director of the Department of Elderly Welfare and Education at Hanseo University, said, "" In a society where generations of senior citizens coexist in the same age, we prepare for the fifth generation of senior citizens to coexist in the same age. "" Heo Joon-soo, a professor of social welfare at Soongsil University, said, Although the system is important to resolve such issues as generation conflict and discrimination against the elderly, the social environment should move toward the joining of the elderly and young. An alternative to this is an age-friendly town, which is not just for the elderly but for the entire generation. Busan Port Logistics in 2014, and students explained to seniors at the Senior Community Center in Nam-gu, Busan how to use smartphones. Experts say that all generations of elderly people need to focus on creating an environment that stresses discrimination. [Central Photo] World Health Organization proposed the town of the elderly 10 years ago. The eight basic directions include the establishment of an easy-to-use public transportation environment, and the strengthening of education and household integration to improve the image of the elderly"
"- It is also stressed that the opportunities for the elderly to participate in volunteer or work activities and that urban infrastructure and housing should be arranged to accommodate the elderly. Although the Seoul Metropolitan Government adopted this concept in 2013, it is still unfamiliar to local governments. ◇ welfare professional reporter, Lee Min-young ' special report team : sinseongsik jeongjonghun & Constantin bakjjeongnyeol baekssujin in Mobile, ▶ ssshin@joongang.co.kr to JoongAng Ilbo reporters [Facebook] [ the cacao.Plus my friend ] [Mobile web] © 5 Kits combine the (http://joongang.co.kr) and jtbc content hub co, Park Geun-hye, former president ban on redistribution of the war damage and without leave, ltd [ Kim Hyo-jin Asian economies.A matter of reporters and press ] Seoul criminal court 22 to 27, Park Geun-hye, former president to attend the trial was (Seyoon Kim, presiding judge) to demand once more.

They were appointed on July 25 after Yoo Young-ha and other lawyers resigned en masse, but the courts did not restart such cases until recently because they were concerned about excessive personal theft. The Seoul Central District Court selected five lawyers out of its 30 attorneys who are in charge of public service, considering their legal background and their wishes. Lawyers for the defense team will be led by Cho, the longest-serving lawyer among them. The public defender appointed Park asked an audience with former president to be held in custody in Seoul three times since, but rejected by all.

Lee appeared as a witness at the trial on July 27, which was held by the Seoul Central District Court with the criminal consensus of the late former chief of staff Lee Young-hoon. Wu is suspected of receiving a secret report from Choo Myung-ho, the former head of the National Intelligence Service on the illegal surveillance by prosecutors when his probe began. Prosecutors asked former commissioner Lee, "" How can I do this to Wu (when the inspection starts)? "" Be disappointed. The media raised the question, but I wonder why we are rushing to inspect it, although it will be quiet next week. ' I understand you said something to be disappointed, Lee said. When asked whether they were struggling with the media coverage, Lee asked, I was struggling with the reports, and the inspectors ' office, too. That is what he meant. In addition to the complaint over the inspections of his son's military privileges, the prosecution asked whether it should start the inspection process on the (Woo's family firm) platform, which was considering launching it, he said.Lee Seok-soo, former special counsel for the National Assembly, attended the hearing on July 27 at the Central District Court in Seoul to appear at Cheong Wa Dae as an aide to the People's Republic of Korea, Woo Byeong-woo.

"", said on April 27. Prosecutors plan to submit the results of their national defense examination to the court as evidence. The Seoul Central District Court's Criminal Agreement, part 22 (Director Judge Kim Se-yoon), verified the identity of Choi's tablet PC during a trial on charges of violating the law on the aggravated punishment of certain crimes.The judge's office then handed over a tablet PC in a yellow document bag to open it to the public via a photo-graphing device. As the log value of the stored data might change when the power was turned on, the machine merely looked at the contents without turning on the power. After verifying its appearance, the court sealed the tablet PC, stored it in a court, and sent it to the National Institute of Scientific Investigation for the purpose of emotion afterwards.Two lawyers and Choi's request came close to her and examined the tablet PC, and Choi himself reached out, joined her hands, and looked closely at the video.After the verification Choi said, I asked for it to be shown consistently from the beginning, but the prosecution did not, and I also reversed a lot of the procurement policy, I saw it today, and I think JTBC planned it.The prosecution confirmed that Choi did not manipulate the tablet PC and used it as if it had been hidden by the prosecution.The tablet PC, allegedly owned by Choi, was found in the Blue K office. Choi jeonghoseong to Cheong Wa Dae presidential secretary, (48) Park Geun-hye, former president received from Dresden's (65) speech, 47, some of the core document contained the core of 'gukjjeong nongdan'.As evidence.However, some political circles continuously raised suspicions that the tablet PC was manipulated. Choi's side also insisted that it was not hers. However, with the results of the international investigation showing no sign of modification or manipulation, the controversy over the authenticity of the tablet PC is likely to end.Prosecutors previously submitted a tablet PC from JTBC and concluded that it was Choi's possession based on her personal history on her remaining tablet PC. Meanwhile, Choi has been demanding verification of the tablet PC, saying it is not Choi's."
"A pillar of the Fillotti structure building in Jangryang-dong, Pohang City, North Gyeongsang Province, is showing its skeletons Thursday after being destroyed by an earthquake the previous day. The pillar-shaped column of Yonhap news and worn bars between them seem to have been distorted. It is also a problematic scene that shows how the Korean peninsula has been insensitive to the dangers of earthquakes, as the recent quake proves that it is no longer an earthquake island.■ Filoty is vulnerable to earthquakes The Pilotis are the Pilotis, designed by French architect Le Corbusier called the Father of Contemporary Architecture This technique maximizes the openness of the spaces so that the movement of people and vehicles can not be blocked by the construction. Swiss Students ' Hall in Paris and Marseille apartments were also built in the pilotis structure.It is not hard to find the pilotis around us. Most apartments, apartments and multiplex housing have used the pilotis structure to utilize the first floor as parking lots or shopping areas. It can house parking lots (or store facilities) and living quarters even in a small area, and it can also satisfy the demand for ground-shy apartments due to security and protection of privacy.However, after the Pohang earthquake, the PilottI structure seems to have become a "" public enemy. "" Social Media said, I live in PilottI Villa and have a crack in the wall. I feel uneasy. "" In the construction and real estate market, the demand for pilotis is forecast to decrease faster than before. PilottI, who is also considered a modern architecture innovation, has become a thorn in her side.Philotti architecture The pilotis, which are supported by the anti-seismic workers of buildings in Seoul only by the pillars of the inspection homepage, can be relatively more vulnerable to earthquakes than ordinary buildings composed of columns, beams and walls. The building is normally loaded in a vertical direction according to gravity, and when ground shaking earthquakes occur, the load changes horizontally. When the bus starts suddenly, it can be damaged by an earthquake, just as passengers fall backwards. PilottI must be connected by a continuous column from the ground floor to the top of the building to withstand the earthquake load.Jeong Gwang-ryang, president of the Korean Structural Engineers Association, said, "" In Korean filotis architecture, the parking lot in the lower level is like a pillar, but in the upper residential areas, lateral forces are often vulnerable. "" According to him, the PilottI architecture was damaged during the Taiwan Chichi earthquake in 1999. In the earthquake-prone countries of the United States, buildings in the western San Francisco area of the country are the first to be built to strengthen the country by earthquake.■ Some say that the pilotis themselves are not the problem, "" dumb ox, the problem is poor construction. "" Fillotti is innocent, and low-rise pilotis are the problem in Korea, says Cho Young-jin, an official at the Institute of Architecture and Urban Studies, a state-run research institute. This means that if the design and construction standards were followed properly, there would have been no safety problems. When examining buildings that were affected by the Pohang earthquake, suspicion of poor construction was high. In the case of a villa with four stories of a pilotis, the cover of a pillar, or the outer concrete surrounding a reinforcing bar, should be about 4cm, which was over 10cm thick. A thick covering means that the core is thin. This reduces the force to withstand the earthquake load.The problem is also the abnormal pilotis. Looking at the pillar-crushed PilottI Villa, the stairwells should be centered on one corner of the building. When built in this manner, as architecture calls it, eccentric cores, it is necessary to balance the forces by placing walls on the other side of the stairs or adding columns to the building. Often, they make their own language to make parking lots wider, but they do not do any reinforcements.Data : Cho Young-jin, an official at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, said, "" If the problem is found to have been found to have been found to have stiffened reinforcement layout based on precision safety tests, including non-destructive testing, and structural inspection results should be made. ""The explosive device that started to mushroom in Korea was mandatory to install parking lots on the first floor of a multI-family or multI-family home in 2002. Builders preferred pilotis that were cheaper to build than digging in land for an underground parking lot. In addition, parking lots are excluded from the floor area ratio calculations, so standing up a pilotis enables you to remove the first floor from the floor of floor. The amendment to the Building Act in 2014 meant that the pilotis section should be excluded from the calculation of building height. It is recognized as the fourth floor of Pontius, which is located on the fifth floor by appearances. PilottI was the most economical structure for building owners because the height limit or floor volume ratio is important for profit, a Seoul-based brokerage said, in effect, the government encouraged the pilotis structure.■ The first floor of the building was also earthquake-proof and the system was careless in securing structural safety, including anti-seismic design. Although the scope of applications for anti-seismic design requirements is gradually expanding, the newly impacted filotis are located in the safety blind spot. First introduced in 1988, anti-seismic design requirements were applied only to buildings with a floor area of 6 or higher or with a total floor area of 100,000 ㎡ or more. It was not until 2015, 27 years later, when it was extended to the third floor or 500 ㎡ or more. Starting next month, the mandatory anti-seismic design targets will be extended to two or more floors or to new buildings with a gross floor area of 200 ㎡ or more, but the anti-seismic performance of buildings with five floors built between 1988 and 2015 is not guaranteed.Therefore, some argue that Korea should strengthen its anti-seismic forces thoroughly. Building industries refer to ways of improving the anti-seismic performance of building structures or reducing the seismic load on buildings. Examples are the structure reinforcing measures that cover the surrounding area of the column with concrete or wrapped in a high-capacity fiber to prevent damage, and the installation of shock absorbing material called a damper, which reduces the impact load.Experts say Pohang earthquake should set the stage for social awareness of anti-seismic design. It is wrong for the government to exclude low-rise structures from the initial list of those subject to anti-seismic design obligations, said Kim Jae-kwan, a construction and environmental engineering professor at Seoul National University.■ The anti-seismic standard for residential buildings should be adjusted at this time, and even non-professionals such as architects can now make anti-seismic designs for buildings below the fifth floor. Some argue that low-rise buildings should be built by an architectural engineer, just like skyscrapers. Even if we reduce regulations based on economic logic, we should tighten the safety regulations, said Chung Kwang-ryang, head of the group.It is also necessary to prepare for the liquidization of the soil. To construct a building in liquid areas, replace rubble etc. to harden a loose ground or use a sand pipe with sand compacting method.

The Korean Residents Union Actually, there is still some prejudice against multicultural families and mixed-race people in Korea. Even better than before.

She's in the top 30 in the world, and now she's a little easy, sitting on the Modelle stage? However, now I think the fashion industry has changed slightly since I first debuted.

That's why you are not only modeling but also promoting multicultural awareness improvement, Mr. Han. ◆ Hanhyeonmin > Yes. I never dreamed that I would be a public relations ambassador at this age. It is an honor to be a good PR ambassador. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : It is an honor, yes. So, are you currently working only in Korea? Or do you play overseas? Although I mainly perform activities at home now, I would like to do it abroad if I have the opportunity. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. What is your dream? Now that I'm only 17, I'm old enough to dream big.I am fine with anything else. I hope everyone is happy first. Kim Hyun-jung > Wow, is your 17 year old dream the happiness of all people and mankind? ◆ Hanhyeonmin > Yes. It's just that some people are sad and some people shouldn't be happy.

A scene beautiful enough to be praised beyond all description It is the same background that anyone who has used a Windows PC will remember. This is one view that many people consider computer graphics, however, is a picture of nature in action. Bliss writer Charles Orier held the work in front of a hill that was the background of the work. The picture is titled ' Happiness. ' Maybe it is because of the title. In the past, reporters felt peaceful when they turned on the computer. The photographer of the United States, Charles Aller, is a 76-year-old duck who has been working for 25 years on National Geographic and others. Omar took this picture in January 1996. It wasn't because of work. He was on his way to see his girlfriend who was living in San Francisco at the time. As he was driving through Napa Valley Sonoma, California, a very picturesque scene was caught in his eye. Thinking, "" Let's take a picture of the clouds before they form another shape, "" he immediately stopped. He then captured the view on his film camera.

"Security guards from the two Koreas confront yesterday's joint guard zone at the truce village of Panmunjeom in Paju, Gyeonggi Province. The North Korean army recently dug a ditch at the border area. [Yonhap news agency] photo@yna.co.kr The first disclosure to the North Korean media of defection from the North Korean military ... A bullet mark shot by a North Korean soldier in a deep ditch near the border with North Korea was shot Thursday morning at a South Korean military base near the truce village of Panmunjeom. North Korean soldiers still remained in the DMZ (Joint Chiefs of Staff) zone on July 13. The Defense Ministry and the United Nations Command (UNC) allowed reporters to accompany Defense Minister Song Young-moo to the Joint Security Area where he visited for encouragement. The first thing that caught the attention of reporters at the scene of North Korea's defection was the clear remaining bullet marks of the North Korean military. Four North Korean soldiers fired shots and 40 AKs at defectors, with five bullet wounds. The UNC estimated that most of the remaining bullets were transferred to areas south of the Military Demarcation Line. In fact, there were three bullet marks in the front of the ventilation container in Freedom House, one in the flank, and one in the granite wall at the bottom of the building, next to the exile. The cedar branches were also littered with bullets. Reporters were unable to count bullet marks on building vents and trees, but they were unable to count them. It was estimated that most of the shots fired by the North's chasing group had been turned south.North Korea's artillery shells hit South Korea Monday morning as a South Korean soldier defected via the Joint Security Area in the southern port of Panmunjeom. A UNC official explained, "" Many bullets did not fit into the building and the tree and went astray. "" Before the reporters arrived at the Joint Security Area on the same day, a South Korean and U.S. military source said, We felt very nervous about two weeks after the incident, adding, "" Please follow the guard's instructions, and tell us how nervous you are.Security guards from the two Koreas confront each other at the Joint Security Area in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, Monday. The North Korean army recently dug a ditch at this point. The Black Hawk helicopter with Minister of Defense arrived at Camp Boniface Helicopter at 11:16 a.m. on Friday. Song approached the scene through the home of freedom with Gen. Thomas Bergerson, commander of the United Nations Command (7th Air Force Commander), and Colonel Steve Lee, secretary general of the UNCMAC. No tourists or guards were seen in the North, but as reporters and reporters flocked, three North Korean soldiers appeared on the other side. A military official said, "" I don't see it on the outside, but I wore a pistol. "" Reporters from both home and abroad who visited the DMZ several times also said, "" It is the first time I went to the scene of defection from the JSA left. "" North Korean soldiers are seen in the vicinity of the Panmunjeom incident on the morning of July 27, as they defected from the South via the Joint Security Area (Joint Security Area) on July 13. In the area where North Korean soldiers were handed over to the South, photo@yna.co.kr showed clear evidence that the North had dug a deep ditch. A UNC official said, "" It was once known that two trees were planted, but they were not planted. "" The defectors crossed the Military Demarcation Line through the passage and collapsed beside the Freedom House annex. The soldier's fall was in a hole in the ground. Because of this, it is believed that it was a blind spot in the gun of the North's pursuit team. Judging from the bullet marks on the granite wall right next to the soldier's fall, it appeared to have missed the aim. Lt. Gen. Kwon Young-hwan, chief of the Korean Army Guards at the Joint Security Agency, said, It was hard to tell with CCTVs at first, so the first time since investigators were covered with fallen leaves, they first started identifying them with thermal equipment (TOD), although it was weekly. Minister Song said, I see a white object on the TOD screen, and when I look at it, it is out of reach. So, it is a topographical feature that is invisible to the North and invisible to the South.Defense Minister Song Young-moo, who visited the Joint Security Area in the DMZ (Combined News Agency), spoke about the incident in which officials and North Korean soldiers defected from the South via the Joint Security Area in the DMZ on July 27. 27. 27.

How do I change my credit limit?As the screening process of income and debt is becoming more rigorous, the government intends to provide more loans to households and the newly married couples to have their debts straightened out when their income is higher. It is intended to improve the quality of household debts and reduce the rate of increase in volume by leaving only competent debt to repay. The screening of individual businesses in the blind spot will also be strengthened. Private businesses that borrow more than 100 million won will have to pay more than the assessment index, and real estate leasing can not do so if their annual rental income falls below a certain standard. It is determined to block loans to the financial sector, which is concentrated only on real estate leasing, systematically. The new DTI is the principal plus interest on all mortgage loans divided by the annual income. Based on the price, the maximum DTI limit applies to speculation zones, overheated speculation zones, and 40 percent to other regions and 50 percent to add additional loans. Though the conversion formula is complicated, the possibility of lending by multiple residents is reduced by about 50 percent from the existing loans. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) on July 26 introduced the "" multI-family home loan "" requirement as an example. Let's assume that one mortgage loan (KRW 180 million) is to be secured and that an additional apartment to be recomposed for 20 years by paying back the installment of an apartment in which he has 70 million won per annum. If the previous DTI was applied, he could borrow 399 million won with 40 percent of DTI applied. However, if the new DTI applies and A dismantles the existing home within two years, the maximum loan limit will be 270 million won. It is because the existing mortgage amount is divided into 20 years and is calculated as a debt. If the owner does not sell the existing home, the amount of the loan's availability will be cut by more than half to 184 million won. The loan period will be decreased because the maturity limit of new mortgage loans (15 years) applies to multiple home owners only, and thus, the loan price will decrease. The method of verifying income will also change. Increase the confirmation period from one to two years to take into account the stability of the income. Financial firms reflect the average of their incomes when the income gap between their owners is larger than two years. Otherwise, the income of the previous year is reflected. When objective evidential evidentiary evidentiary documents, such as sources of income increase, are submitted, incentives are given for documentary income. On the other hand, indirect proof such as national pension and health insurance payment details will be subject to penalties. However, if future income growth is anticipated, future income can be reflected in the calculation of income only for non-defensive repayment loans with a maturity of more than 10 years. Under the measures to protect the underprivileged, young people and newly married couples will have a higher ceiling on their loans when their future income increases are approved. As the obligation to verify the income of evidence is eased for the past two years, submitting only one year's worth of income is reflected in the increase of prospective earnings. The annual debt to debt of the new DTI depends on the type of debt payment. If the government eliminates the grace period and takes a long term, the amount of loans will increase. The DSR, a stronger regulation than the new DTI, is scheduled to be introduced in the fourth quarter of next year. DSR is the sum of all principal and principal, such as mortgage loans, and other loans such as the minus account and divided it into annual incomes. Housing mortgage loans are also introduced as the new DTI rule. A rental loan only contains interest payments as a debt. Credit loans and credit accounts will be repaid over 10 years, taking into consideration the maximum period that they can be extended. Lenders of individual businesses, including real estate operators, are also strained by the introduction of the ratio of loans to income (LTI) and the ratio of rental interest payment (RTI). Those who wish to make new loans worth more than 100 million won will use their income as a reference by introducing LTI, which is divided by the total amount of loans. RTI is an indicator of the interest cost relative to annual rental income. If this value is not more than 1.25 to 1.5, loans may be constrained.Ahn Kyu-young, reporter kyu@kmib.co.kr, graphics = Lee Seok-hee [Kookmin Daily homepage] [Facebook] [Newspaper's Hook!

[EPA = Combined News Agency] (Jakarta = Yonhap news) Hwang Chul-hwan : As Agung volcano, the highest mountain on Bali Island in Indonesia, began a full-scale eruption, lava flowed down the slopes soon. Indonesian State Disaster-General for Disaster (BNPB) Sutopo Forwarnugroho made the statement at a news conference on July 27. In fact, red light has been visible at the crater site of the summit due to the lava that has been rising since July 25. Local volcanic experts said the light gets stronger as time went by, and they now see smoke clouds rising from the crater turn red even during the day. We have heard a strong drink radius of up to 12km due to explosive differentiation since July 26, Sutopo said, stressing that the authorities are setting up countermeasures based on the worst-case scenario. The 3,402-meter-high Agung volcano erupted in 1963. At that time, some 1,100 residents of the village were killed and hundreds were injured.Foreign Tourist (Jakarta = Yonhap News Agency), Hwang Chul-hwan : Foreign tourists are taking pictures of Agung Volcano, which spouts smoke pillars on the Indonesian island of Bali on July 27. After being dormant for more than 50 years, Agung volcano erupted again in September, four times between July 25 and 26. Volcanic experts have diagnosed the Agung volcano as being in full force. Indonesian national disaster control authorities raised the alert level on the volcano to the highest level among the four at 6 a.m. local time, and extended the radius of the crater to 6.0 to 7.5 kilometers. It is known that the town's 22 provinces have 90,000 to 100,000 residents, but local authorities need to take urgent measures since only 40,000 residents have been evacuated. The Indonesian government also decided to suspend the operation of Bali Eungurarai International Airport for 24 hours starting at 7 a.m. on July 27. Euura Yanulohim, spokesman for the airport said, At least 445 takeoff and landing flights were canceled, leaving 59,000 passengers stranded.It is known that the Indonesian airport in Bali, Eungurarai, whose operation was suspended due to volcanic eruptions in Agung on July 27 (local time), contains many Korean tourists. According to Indonesian authorities and the local tourism industry, the average number of Korean tourists to Bali during this time of year is around 16,000 per month, and about 500 people fly to Korea each day. A Korean Embassy official in Indonesia said, We didn't have any problems right now because the airport was up until early July 27, but the damage was canceled due to the closing of the airport on July 27 and 28.The flight check-in counter for Indonesia's flight Caruda Indonesia is empty at Incheon Airport, with the International Airport in Bali, Indonesia closed on November 27, 2017. [Yonhap] The Embassy of Korea in Bali is cooperating and providing advice and support to backpackers who can not get help from travel agencies. It is known that the influence of volcanic eruptions is almost invisible in the cities of Dempasar, the center of Bali, and in the major tourist resort of Kuta. A Korean resident in Dempasar said, If you go to the coast, you can see a column of smoke, but it is completely unrealistic. With the airport closed today, it appears people who are about to leave are lined up at each airline to get their tickets refunded. Still, Koreans are watching the trend with the possible volcanic eruption affecting the economy in Bali. Koreans in Bali mostly work in travel businesses with about 1,000 people, and concerns about possible volcanic eruptions have made it extremely difficult for Koreans to make reservations until April next year, said an official at the Korea University in Seoul. We expect more customers to cancel the trip this week and next, said Kim Jong-kyun, 40, head of the Bali Travel Association, in a statement, to what extent the situation should be observed until tomorrow. hwangch@yna.co.kr ▶ Hike Starbucks Coffee for the 400 Minutes and Inquiries (Click!) ▶ Rise in Seoul's Yonhap News Channel Interests Bank's Interests Rate Up by 0.09 %%p ; Business's Interest rates are rising by 0. 0.03p, and interest rates are rising in the market by yes…and savings banks ' Higher market rates have contributed to the rise in all lending rates, including mortgage loans and collective loans. According to the Bank of Korea's report on October 27, the average rate of household loans at deposit banks rose by 3.09 percent to 3.41 percent last month from 3.09 percent a year earlier. It has risen for the second month since August, the highest since January 2015 when it was 3.59 percent.The main reason why household loan rates have increased so much is that the market rates, which are indicators of the mortgage rate calculation, have continued to rise. Interest rates on bank bonds AAA gained 0.25 % p.p from 1.99 % in September to 2.24 % last month. Five-year-long rates rose by 0.26%p from 2.22 % to 2.48 % during the same period.

Interest rates on collective loans also rose 0.24 percent to 3.38 percent from the previous month. As a measure to increase in number, the figure was the biggest increase in four years and 10 months since January 2013 when it was 0.36 percent p. The effects of low interest rates on loans around the Seoul metropolitan area have been slowed down, and high interest rates have increased in the provinces.The arrival of an Internet bank has sparked a low interest rate competition among banks, with the rate of credit loans falling to 4.22 percent last month for the first time in August.

That is an 18. 4 increase from 54.3 % a year ago. It is estimated that more households chose to borrow floating rates with relatively lower interest rates than fixed rate loans. Corporate lending rates fell 0.03 percent to 3.45 percent per annum from the previous month. Large business loans rose 0.01 percent to 3.11 percent from the previous month, but small business loans to small and medium-sized enterprises fell 0.02 percent to 3.67 percent. The low interest rate loans by some small and midsize businesses at banks affected the overall interest rate.Thanks to the rise in market rates, the Bank's interest rate on new payments increased 0.10.p from the previous month to 1.63 % per annum. This is the effect that some banks have exerted to attract funds to manage lending and deposit rates. Net savings rates rose 0.10 percent to 1.59 percent per annum from the previous month. Market types such as certificates of deposit (CD) increased by 0.14 % to 1.78 % per annum from the previous month.As the Bank of Korea`s rates rose sharply, lending and deposit rates decreased 0.10 percent to 1.83 percent in October from the previous month.

"Jeong Seong-ho, a reporter at Samsung Electronics ' General Technology Institute, said, "" We were able to make the charging capacity of batteries faster than traditional lithium ion batteries by 27 times. "" Existing lithium ion batteries took nearly an hour to fully recharge using the fast charging technique, but batteries with green fin ball materials were fully charged in 12 minutes. It can also maintain its stability to 60 degrees, the temperature standard required for electric car batteries. Samsung Electronics ` technical research team, Sohn In-hyuck and Dooseok, recently launched a research paper titled ` High-Capacity Ellin ` using the online version of Nature Communications. Graphine is a thin layer of carbon atoms peeled from graphite. It is the ideal material for fast charging because it has more than 100 times more electricity than copper and can move electrons faster than silicon by 140 times. While looking for ways to apply the intensity and conductivity to the battery, the research team identified the graphene with a three-dimensional mechanism that uses inexpensive silica, or Sir2, to create a large volume popcorn. As a result of using this green fin ball as the positive protection material and the negative material of lithium ion batteries, it is found that the high temperature safety can be achieved with increased charging capacity and shorter charging time.

As the volcano erupted on July 26, ash rose to a height of 3400 meters, shutting down Bali Kongurarai Airport and neighboring Lombok Island's airport for about 60km straight. Major airlines decided to cancel the trip following the airport's closure, and the Foreign Ministry recommended that Korea refrain from traveling to Bali for the time being. According to the travel industry on July 27, major airlines will exempt airports from paying in real time. The travel agency is determined to abide by the airline's policy of exemption of cancellation fees. Korean Air will cancel the cancellation fee until June 28 when it cancelled its scheduled departure from Incheon at 6:00 p.m. and the flight KE63 which was scheduled to depart for Incheon at 1:25 a.m. Flights are not yet subject to exemption, however, after 29 days. Karuda Indonesia Airlines also decided to exempt the cancellation fees until the flight leaves on July 28, and will change the cancellation fee depending on whether the airport closes or not. Major travel agencies are said to be exempt from paying the fees according to the airline's action. A travel agency official said, "" The amount of cancellation fees will vary depending on whether or not the flights are operated, "" and that "" cancellation by the carrier's fee exemption date, "" would result in a payment by Article 15 Consumer Dispute Resolution.However, the official said, "" In the event of cancellation due to natural disasters such as Bali, we tried to reduce the losses on our travelers.

"▽ The government should collect public opinions to establish objective criteria, ’’ Kim Min-soo, a reporter at Yonhap news agency, said on September 30, "" As the number of abortion and abortion termination procedures continued to grow, the number of people who support the petition regarding the abolition of abortion laws grew. Presidential Secretary for Civil Affairs, his own home office, answered, "" We will not resume an eight-year-long investigation on artificial abortions next year. "" However, the medical community is now in favor of abortion and opposition. According to the Korean Obstetrics and Gynecology Association and Obstetrics and Gynecology, members are also divided on whether or not to have an abortion. In particular, since abortion surgery is such a sensitive issue in society and in religion, no one had any intention to express their opinion publicly. Kim Seung-cheol, director of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic at Ewha Womans University, said, We can not make an official answer because we share the opinion even within the gynecology community, and that the general punishment for abortion is not illegal. Doctors who are against abortion now are known to believe that they should continue to ban abortion on the grounds of ethics or personal religion. In contrast, doctors in favor of abortion should only claim to have unwanted pregnancies, such as rape and incest, or if there is a problem with the baby's body, such as chromosome aberrations, and allow for abortion. As both sides of the medical profession are very tense and each has its own reasons, obstetricians agree, it is difficult for the medical profession to come forward and provide the standard on abortion operations. Basically, doctors are thinking of ' respect for life, ' said Kim Dong-seok, head of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic, adding, `` The life of the unborn child is important and the health of the female is to be protected. That is why abortion is not an issue that the medical community can rush to. In response, the Obstetrics and Gynecology Association asked the government to come forward and adjust laws and systems related to abortion, and set a stage for public debate to avoid any possible social disputes. As it is difficult for us to organize on whether to introduce an abortion operation at the current conference, we hope that the government will gather the people`s thoughts, said Kim Seung-cheol, director of the Korea Obstetrics and Gynecology Association. Kim Dong-seok, head of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic, also said, "" Even if the criteria for ' living things ' are met due to the number of pregnancies, the debate within the medical profession could arise, "" and abortion laws would first be discussed.Cheong Wa Dae, the plea for the abolition of abortion [production Choi Ja-yoon, Lee Tae-ho] [Photo Synthetic kms@yna.co.kr Lee Yong-ho from the left, Kim Tae-nyun, chief policymaker of the Free Korea Party, Kim Gwang-lim.

"" No special features were discovered. The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency announced on July 27 that it conducted a witness examination on one of two people who were sitting at the table next to the incident. Witnesses in a police investigation were quoted as saying they had neither seen nor heard of Kim`s assault or abuse nor had any memory of him breaking a glass. The people at the table next door have not been able to sit with their backs between Kim`s table and the glass, police said. Police are investigating witnesses against the lawyers who were with Kim at the time.

Police randomly submitted the hard disk of the CCTV to the store during an on-site investigation on July 21. The video clips of the day were deleted about two months after the incident. After receiving the hard disk of the CCTV on July 22, the Cyber Security Bureau of Seoulcheng is planning to deliver its report to the investigating team this week.

"Starting next year, multiple home owners will not be able to receive mortgage loans. The longer the loan period is, the more money the document is available to prove the income of two years. The Financial Services Commission announced Monday its plan to advance the screening process of banks ' loans. The measures to follow up on the household debt package (measures to be adopted by households) included details of the new total debt repayment ratio (DTI) and the total repayment ability (DSR) ratio (ratios of total household debt), that is to be computed : Financial institutions have so far given out new loans based on the existing DTI when lending money on housing collateral, but existing loans only reflected interest rates as a debt. However, as the new DTI (all states principal plus other lending interestear income) is introduced, multiple people will be required to borrow up to the principal amount of the existing state to reduce the available loan. Even if you borrow the same amount of money, the longer you borrow, the less you pay each year. As such, the amount of available loans will increase. The grace period is excluded from the loan period. A payment by running the principal on the maturity of a loan is allowed up to 10 years at the longest. In addition, multiple homeowners will calculate the DTI by limiting the maturity of the loan site to 15 years for the second new month. When receiving a new credit, the previous intermediate payment or transfer fee loan is divided by 25 years, and then included in the car's debt to calculate the DTI. The way car owners earn their annual income is also complicated. It is also possible to identify evidence income in the last two years, breaking away from the existing method in which only one year of income was identified. If you fail to properly demonstrate a two-year income, a penalty can be imposed on the loan. However, those who need the money for their income should not be required to check their income for two years. In addition, the new DTI will be eased for the two owners of the two temporary states for moving purposes.

Sohn Dae-seong, a reporter of Pohang = Yonhap News Agency (November 27), 2017.11.27. : "" There is a crack in the concrete road and the pavement of Ascon on the right is turned off. However, after the earthquake, the ground subsidence appeared from the area that drove the car several times, so I could feel the damage was greater than I thought. The road is paved mostly with concrete, with ascon in sparsely dotted areas. When driving along the road, the ascon paved section went down, making a difference between the concrete section and the height. If you pass the Ascon section and enter the concrete section, you can feel as if your car is moving up a bit. Concrete pavements also have cracks in them. Of course, due to the nature of concrete, cracks can be found in the area of Heunghae-eup, close to the epicenter, so it is possible to guess that they are related to earthquakes. The crack was immediately visible as many cars were moving around, but it did not contain stones or foreign bodies. The central separation zone near the bridge was recently cracked and measures more than 10cm apart on the rail of the other leg. Unlike this section of Yeongmundae-gil, it was difficult to find cracks in the area on the south side and there weren't many areas where ground subsidence appeared. One driver said, We need to investigate whether the ground subsidence or cracks are related to the earthquake.Sohn Dae-seong, a reporter at Yonhap News Agency (Pohang) : "" There is a crack in the concrete road on Yeongmado Road, Yeong-Mangdae-ro, Buk-gu, Pohang-si, Gyeongbuk, Korea 2017.11.27 sds123@yna.co.kr"

The little bus that looked like a cable car with wheels was packed with no drivers or bus drivers. When the passengers got in and sat down, the doors closed and the bus moved itself. Local resident child Gna Franz (48) said, "" It is the first form of public transportation in our town. ""Starting on July 25, buses with self-powered routes carried passengers from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. Doichevan, a German state-run railway company, introduced a bus built by Easy Mile, a French autonomous car company, and began pilot of its Autonomous Driving Service in the village. It is the first time an autonomous buses have been placed on public transportation routes in Germany.The bus travels about 700 meters between the plaza in front of spa resort, Shinjigang Market, and three downtown stops, including the tourist information center. A constant speed of 15km per hour follows a line based on GPS (Global Positioning System). It can go up to 40 kilometers per hour, but has limited speed to prevent accidents.

The charge is free.Residents and tourists ride an autonomous driving bus at the bus stop in Bart Bjorbach, Germany. The bus is Germany's first autonomous public transportation system and has been running on trial since late last month. / Until now, 6,000 residents had to walk or drive their own cars to market in downtown areas. It was not easy to get a job, so we had no bus route. "" The quality of life has greatly increased among residents, "" said an official at the Rosemary Beshlinger Tourist Information Center.The spa resort is visited by 850,000 visitors per year. However, with no public transportation connecting the station, which is 1.15 kilometers from the resort, tourists often come by themselves on winding mountain roads. The team is scheduled to extend its route to the station next year. `` Next time, I will try taking the train and riding the bus, '' said tourist Bruno Siner, 64. The buses are used by an average of 50 passengers per day, including residents and tourists.The bus is not technically perfect yet. If there are illegal parking cars on the route, they can not be avoided, and employees are required to control them with a dedicated controller. The German government always makes sure that its employees ride on an autonomous driving bus to prevent accidents.The team is planning to make up for its shortcomings one by one based on pilot information. Next year, the buses will be connected to smartphones and buses that can be used to call an autonomous driving bus to the front of the house like a call taxi. The town is the best place to test autonomous vehicles because of the low probability of emergencies on the roads, said Daily Frankfurter Alger. Next year, we will test drive buses in many big and small cities, including Hamburg, said Tina Jormer, a bus driver at the Autonomous Driving Team.

[Introduction of high school credit system in 2022 [Choi Ja-yoon] To that end, from next year, 60 policy research schools will be designated and operated, and about 40 leading schools will be designated and operated with the aim of spreading diverse and distinctive curriculum. The Education Ministry announced on July 27 that it plans to introduce a high school credit system in 2022 after preparing and reviewing the mid - to long-term plans for promoting the system and operating the research schools. High school grades are not a standardized education system based on the premise of admission, but a utilitarian study aimed at exploring the way in which students can develop their potential. Education completion is judged based on the number of days of attendance and not the number of days of official attendance. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education Kim Sang-gon visited Kyung-Hanseo High School in Seoul on July 27 and visited Kyung-Seong High School, a selective high school curriculum. kane@yna.co.kr Credit based curriculum that allows students to choose from courses based on each stage of the course. Social, cultural and vocational aptitude areas can add necessary subjects while mathematics or science can organize classes by level of difficulty and learning. Classes can be heard by year or by year and are administered centrally to discuss and practice. Assessment is carried out by applying an achievement assessment (absolute assessment) to the process, and implementation of the completion and beauty assessment system similar to that of universities in the mid - to long-term period is considered. The high school credit system was gradually promoted through the operation of two research and leadership schools, preparation of a policy study and comprehensive plan for promoting them, collection of field opinions, and introduction of the system by 2021. About 30 policy-research schools and vocational high schools will be designated within this year, and some 40 of the leading institutions participating in the High-School Education Promotion Project will be designated. [Graphic] The implementation of the high school credit system in 2022 and the preparation of the credits system will be strengthened in schools for major operating systems. To expand the right for students to choose their subjects, the central and provincial education office was required to rank students from next year by the number of students who took part in the joint curriculum calculation program.The Education Ministry plans to prepare a policy study to improve the graduation system based on the current graduation standards based on attendance days. The institution identifies necessary infrastructure for the introduction of the credit system, including teachers and facilities, and also develops an effective model for managing the curriculum. In particular, the ministry will estimate the scale of the increase of teachers by adding more classes, and will consider the need to expand facilities such as course activities, variable classrooms, and independent learning rooms.

Deputy Prime Minister and Education Minister Kim Sang-gon held a meeting at Hanseo High School in Seoul to discuss plans to promote high school credit plans. As he said, "" I will prepare to introduce the credit system through linkage with reform of the high school system, curriculum, class evaluation reform, and improvement of the university entrance system, "" the students were told that the degree system would enable students to choose the subjects they would like to focus on, and that they would focus on their autonomy. kong@yna.co.kr"

AFPAPF = News 1 (News 1) = The family members of the Argentine Navy are missing, but the family member is missing on time.Family members and friends of the missing sailors attended the ceremony outside the Mardell Plata naval base.As AFP reported, the Navy's spokesman Enrique BalbI said of possible survivors should "" move only on firm evidence. We will focus on finding submarines for now, vague. However, most of the family members have lost hope since authorities announced on July 23 that they heard an explosion inside the submarine. The family claimed that San Juan was very old, but the Navy denied it had undergone any major checks two days before setting sail. As weather conditions eased compared to last week, search continued on July 25 for missing crew members and San Juan. As the Antonov transport plane of Russia's seabed detection robot, which can be searched for up to 1000 meters below the surface of the water, arrived, the search speed was also accelerated. The United States, Britain, Brazil and Chile are also supporting search. German model TR-70000-class Huano lost contact with the South American side while returning to the Mardel-Flatta base about 400 kilometers from its southernmost Ussuaia base. From left are floor leaders Kang Hoon-sik, Park Hong-keun, vice floor leader of the ruling and opposition parties, adjustable commissioner of the national territory transportation committee, floor committee chairman Woo Jong-sik, chief policymaker Kim Hyun-mi, and head of the national security and local housing rental service Lee Bul-dong. Democratic Party chief policymaker Kim Tae-nyun made the remark at a briefing on the morning after consultations between the ruling and opposition parties on the welfare roadmap. The government and the ruling party will provide various welfare programs to meet the standard of living and income, and actively pursue measures to provide more rental and rent-lease housing, he explained. The residential welfare roadmap is based on ▲ personalized support by life stage and income level _ expanding housing supply for the homeless and working class _ and constructing a base for the implementation of housing welfare tasks. The government and the government provided rental housing packages and financial support to reflect the housing supply and demand by life stage and income level, including youth, newlyweds, elderly people, and the low-income bracket, to tailor support by life stage and income level. To expand housing supply for the homeless, the Act provided public rental apartments 650,000 for the homeless and the needy, public support private rentals 200,000, public rental apartments 150,000 and a total of one million apartments. To ensure stable housing, new development areas for public housing will be needed in addition to public land already secured. To establish the basis for the implementation of residential welfare tasks, the related laws and systems were adjusted, such as the Housing Lease Protection Act, and the effects of housing welfare were enhanced by deploying cooperative housing welfare governance with local governments, social and economic entities. Main contents of support customized for each life stage and income level were initially agreed to provide 300,000 apartments for the homeless and the homeless, aged 39 years or younger, to be supplied with low-cost rental housing to support young people. 300,000 apartments will be built with 130,000 public rental apartments, 120,000 public-supported apartments and 50,000 college students ` dormitories. In addition, it decided to strengthen the monthly loan support for youths and provide savings for home rental apartments by introducing youth preferential subscription accounts. In addition, the ministry will expand the scope of support for married couples to childless couples and couples who have no children within seven years of their current marriage to support married couples. It supplies the newly married town of 70,000 at 80 % of the market price and 70 % of the supply to the most wanted metropolitan area. To support housing for elderly households, ' pension-type rental units ' were also adopted. LH purchased or remodeled homes for the elderly and split the cost of the sale into pension plans to support the preparation of living funds for elderly households. It provides public rental housing to the elderly who sold their homes. To support housing for the low-income and vulnerable, the government will provide emergency support homes for households who are in danger of being forced to the streets and expand their support for housing benefits starting next year. The housing support project for non-residential residents, such as paperball and vinyl houses, was also activated. The DP plans to first revise related laws, including the Special Act on Private Rental Housing and the Housing City Fund Act, to realize the effects of the roadmap early on. I expect the roadmap will help create a detailed housing reconstruction network that will help build a residential ladder from the working class to the middle class from marriage to childbirth, Kim said. Meanwhile, the details of the roadmap for housing welfare will be announced at a joint briefing on July 29 at 11 a.m. by related ministries. ironn108@newsis.com>"
"Another problem is the field practice of major discrepancy … [Unintended or meaningless training should be eliminated] at the funeral of a high school student named Lee Min-ho, who died while on the scene of an on-site exercise by CBS correspondent Moon Joon-young. The company said it received an apprentice for the good cause of the job creation, but received criticism due to the poor working conditions and the heavy work hours. The inspection of the schools was just a formality, and the education office could not do anything. It has been less than a year since Hong, an apprentice at LG U-Plus Field, killed herself in January. Where is the fundamental problem with the field training for high school students? ◇ Students or workers, ’’ Lee worked as a normal worker. The beverage maker drove its own forklift truck to move the products after identifying the flow and failure of the automated machines. According to the agreement written by the school and businesses, they were forced to work seven hours a day, but were forced to work longer than 12 hours. The company has also signed a contract to work separately from the company. He was a student and a worker.Kim Kyung-yup, director of the Korean Teachers and Education Workers ` Union, said that the disclosure of problems at the special high schools field in North Jeolla Province and an alternative search and development meeting were not conducted to look back on the death of LG Yoo-Plus.Regarding field work at businesses, the Labor Standards Act and the Industrial Accident Compensation Act are almost applied, but it is difficult to protect them when short-term experiences or contracts are not concluded, Kim said.◇ Major and inconsistent subjects = Hong Yang, who was an apprentice to LG U +, was a pet science student who was not involved in call center work. Minho, who died this time, majored in gardening. School authorities say it was done with the consent of the students. If Minho's accident happened at a beverage maker site in Yongamdae Park (photo = Moon Joon-young), but fails to find a job at a university that matches student's major, students are majoring in reality. Students who are dispatched are often left out of the race due to their major or aptitude conflicts, their work conditions, their dissatisfaction with their work conditions and their discord with their superiors, Kim said.The vocational training promotion law, which states that vocational training students are sent to the project site to select their own field of expertise, is not being properly enforced on the site.◇ Poor follow-up management field = The post management of contributors or those who have made changes in their career is also not easy. Boordan, who works at Hallim Technical High School in Jeju, stresses that, We need to have dedicated staff such as job support officials to deal with emergencies.Teachers can change their work to a yearly schedule and move to a new position, Park said. But the graduates are not at the end of their careers, and we need staff to deal with them when they are forced to give up their jobs. Currently, one of the job support officers (Industry Cooperation Coordinator) is assigned to the hallim notice. Schools earned funds by preparing business plans for Jeju Island and the Small and Medium Business Administration, so they were able to manage job applicants. If the performance of the business falls, such as the employment rate, it could discourage them from applying for the project, Park said. The small business employment rate is most important when collecting money, which is why teachers can not help but tighten their belts. The current job support officer is also under a 10-month contract. It is the time when students are suspended from practicing on the spot rapidly. Students are more likely to want to change careers or enter universities, but management of them is actually a difficult situation, he added.The memorial space for the late Lee Min-ho at Jeju City's bus station (photo = Moon Jun-young) was also used as a reference material for the special high school field practice and the alternative discussion table.Kim wrote, "" The more difficult situation is not the current situation at specialized schools ; jobs are required, and it is as if they were forced to endure in the company by April next year. """" For the third graders, the rate of employment has always been a terrible pressure and pressure to feel since the beginning of the second semester. It is not the purpose of ' sending away good job ' or ' sending away good job '. As teachers are driven by their performance and employment rates, students are being left behind, and due to a lack of dedicated staff, students are not properly managing their work.According to the Jeju Office of Education, 488 out of the 10 high school graduates in the province got jobs last year, or 28 percent.It is important to improve the field practice system and activate the intent, but it is time to take care of the rest of the students, who account for more than 70 percent of them.◇ Inequality between different industries and on-site practical training depending on local characteristics in Jeju Island is necessary, as the primary and tertiary industries such as agriculture and tourism have developed, the manufacturing industry is poor. It is a structure that inevitably creates a mismatch between the supply and demand of each department and businesses of specialized high schools by region.Some schools send their students to companies due to their concerns, while those specializing in civil and construction, such as the Hallim Notice, are receiving more from businesses. In fact, more than 300 companies applied for jobs in the announcement last year. There are quite a few employers for the information. It is also true that some of them are inferior. We are selecting good companies and sending them to practices with student consent. Kim Kyung-yeop, director of the policy bureau, wrote in his speech, "" Considering academic characteristics and local characteristics, we need to open various field trips to vocational training programs, such as those for each school vacation. "" ◇ Just as important as the improvement in the system is, the four students are practicing on the field, said Kim Young-doo, head of Sinje Industry, a company that accepts field students from Jeju. We are selecting matched majors and working in groups of two, three and it is important for companies to follow the written agreement."" Kids can learn skills on site, and when they are hired as full-time workers, it is not the job of companies to solve the labor shortage, "" Kim said. "" It is my opinion that the most important thing is to raise ordinary students. "" The government should pay more attention to the work rights and standards of the residents of Dubul fishermen who visited the site on July 24. If the current practice is not of educational significance, we should review the special training sessions at the high schools and abolish them in the process of consideration, Kim said. Speaking at a Jeju field office in Seoul on July 24, the floor leader Woo Won-sik said, "" The new government did not want to provide on-site training to the Employment and Learning Center, not to provide sufficient information on why it will provide on-site practical training.

In the fourth grade Social Textbooks ` Formation of Villages and Community Life `, the figures of the village and village students were all drawn as men. Pictures of what is being done in fishing villages also showed men alone. In the third grade science textbook, which introduces the National Institute of Scientific Investigation, only images of male researchers were included. The researchers who introduce the National Institute of Scientific Investigation in the 3rd grade science textbooks were also men. North Korean teachers who began monitoring, said, We must also show women working in the science field to provide opportunities for various career options. The fifth grade class, the body of the textbook, and the message of the child's home were all expressed as if the role of a woman was to check and take care of the sick child. Meanwhile, the text of the fifth grade department and the subject of the subject ' Na and Home Life ' was determined by the role of the mother to look at the child's school life. When does mom come to see my parents in the home?', ' How did she get all the work done at work? You waited and worked for your family even though it was hard for you!The expression on the back reflects the perception that women are the only ones who work for the family. There were also stories of sticking up male or female images. In the fifth grade physical education textbook, the boys raised their arms and showed off their strength, while the girls held their jaws tightly wrapped in one hand. Boys wore blue shirts and pants, and girls wore pink dresses. The images used do not relate to the changes in the body parts, said the teachers at Bugicho. A fifth grade physical education textbook that explains changes in the body and mind of puberty. Photographs were used to preserve images of men and women, regardless of the content of the text. ▽ Photo-Korea Institute for Gender Equality and Education : Most of the people who get into trouble or do horrible things are portrayed as men. Korean in the second semester of the third grade - men were the sleepyhead, heart, and mischief makers who explained the word ' little boy ' in my textbooks.

The main source of trouble and mischief was described as being the boy. Buk Yi-cho, a teacher at the Korea Institute for Gender Equality and Education, said, "" It is a great opportunity for teachers to review what has been left behind in their textbooks to develop a sense of gender equality.

"Dilantag, a migrant worker who lost his face in an industrial disaster and returned home to Sri Lanka. On Sunday, March 6, 2010, at 3:00 a.m., dye factory dorm, Daegu. Less than one pyeong of Dilanta's accommodation caught fire. He suffered three degrees of burns, down to 24 percent of his body, including his face, neck, arms and hands. The fingers have lost their nerve and have cut off eight. He was an unregistered foreign worker (an illegal resident). In November of the following year, he returned to his hometown of Panadoura in Sri Lanka. The villagers pointed a finger at his burnt face.Migration workers who have suffered from a video disaster at work sites, such as Dilanta, usually receive poor compensation and protection. Videotherapy is more expensive than other treatments without industrial insurance. That is why many of the victims give up plastic surgery to restore. How do you think migrant workers who are burnt while working in Korea live? She visited Panadaura, Pohang, and Tongyeong, North Gyeongsang Province, to meet them. Beyond the camera viewfinders, one could see the pain beyond words. Foreign workers in the article wrote their names instead of their country's in accordance with their custom. _ Editor Dilanta sat on her bedroom at her home in Panadura, Sri Lanka, on Oct. 1, shutting her eyes slowly. The four families of Dilanda, his wife, his son and his daughter should pay tribute to their younger brother when he marries. Sri Lanka has a long tradition of the youngest son in the family taking over his parents ' property. "" My daughter, Ulugh, and Jal are pretty, "" said Lana Manatun, who recently opened a grocery store on one side of the house, in front of her two old friends, to celebrate her opening. Dilanta worked in Korea for about four years from August 2007 to November 2011 before returning to her hometown of Panadura, a southwestern Sri Lanka town.A proud husband in Korea who succeeded in getting a job, Dilanta (right) looks away from her middle school student, Janudida, on October 2 at 5:35 a.m., and looks at her son, Januda, on a school shuttle bus.Dillanta boasted of her three-year-old daughter Sanudi this year, but his smile was not very well received. It is because the skin of my face was damaged by severe burns I suffered when working in Korea.Dilanta was born on April 12, 1979. Panavura, who lives now, is the home he grew up in. She married Sudipa, 37, a friend since she was 15, and gave birth to her son Januda (11) the following year. Around this time, Sri Lanka was worried about a civil war between government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam. Dilanta said, I have worked in various jobs but could not make more than 200,000 won a month anywhere. But it cost me too much money to live with the baby. After the civil war, the government raised taxes significantly to lower the nation's debt, causing a lot of hardship for low-income workers like Dilanta.I heard that several friends are leaving for Korea to make money. Sri Lanka's government signed a written memorandum of understanding with South Korea in 2004, allowing Sri Lanka's workers to work in Korea under the Employment Permit System. The work permit system means a system that allows factories in labor shortage to legally hire foreign workers when they meet certain requirements. Foreign workers who have entered the country under the system can work in Korea for up to four years and 10 months. Among the 278,488 foreign workers from 16 countries working in Korea according to the current employment permit system, the number of Sri Lanka workers amounts to 24,103.It was on August 22, 2007 when Dilanta came to South Korea with a dream of ' Korean Dream. ' On the same day, Dilanta entered Incheon International Airport and began working at a pipe production plant in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province. The minimum wage that year was only 3450 won per hour, but wages in Korea were nearly three times higher than in Sri Lanka. Dilanta earned 600 thousand won each month from the factory and remitted part of her salary home on a quarterly basis. In early 2010, just before suffering from industrial accidents, he earned 1.3 million won per month in recognition of his skill. She was selected from over 10,000 applicants and was proud of herself for having a Korean dream. His wife, Sudipa, was proud of her husband, who made a lot of money. Working in Korea, Dilanta often witnessed industrial accidents. Sri Lankan colleague Doosmantharanga, 35, fractured her wrist while making a pipe. At the Dillandopipe factory, two wrist breaks occurred. Dilanta worked for a dyeing factory in Daegu in 2009, her third year in Korea, after moving over the fence several times. Under the current employment permit system, however, companies can not change their locations without certain requirements. It was the moment when Dilanta's status was changed to an unregistered migrant worker.After a quarter of a body was burned, Dilanta (right) celebrated at her house in the same neighborhood on October 1 and stretched out her son Januda on the couch. Dilanta drank the same day and returned to a two-story, brick-built, shabby dorm. Less than one pyeong of accommodation was on fire the next morning at 3:00 a.m. The electric fan heater collapsed and heated up the mattress, when a fire hit the dilanta. It was not until two and a half hours after the fire, a couple of Thais went to the bathroom outside their dorm and called 119 after seeing a suspicious performance. Dilanta got into an ambulance and arrived at the hospital at 6 a.m.Dilanta's friend Dorumanta described the situation in blunt Korean. "" I heard about the accident and arrived at the hospital emergency room at 6:30. Dilanta's face was really swollen. Both my face and my body were red, tanned or skinned, "" explained Lee Byung-seok, a compensation insurance policy for industrial accidents for migrant workers who were unfamiliar with Korean. Under the Labor Standards Act, unregistered foreign workers can receive protection from the Industrial Accident Compensation Act. Doods Manta and Dilanta did not know this at first. Fortunately, he was able to ask for compensation for industrial accidents later on with the help of other Korean-speaking migrant workers in Sri Lanka.Dilanta clearly remembers the pain she had in the hospital because of language problems. "" During the treatment, I went to the hospital many times because of the cost and failure of the operation. I wanted to know why I had to move to a hospital, but I wasn't good with Korean, "" he had surgery done at the first hospital to remove his thighs and implant them on his face. The operation was unsuccessful. The detailed explanation was also given in Korean and some English when the surgeon cut eight fingers at Keimyung University's Dongsan Hospital, his third visit on June 20, 2011. What he understood at the time was that it would be better to "" cut off the fingers that weren't used anyway and use the remaining joint tips. ""According to the medical report issued by Dilanta, issued at Dongsan Hospital on August 16, 2011, 24 percent of the body was affected by a fire, including head, face, neck, arms, and hands. After having cut eight fingers off a severe body burn, he was declared a class-fourth-grade handicap. They have lost their normal work force. Dilanta received a daily average of 4.90 million won in damages as a compensation for the damages. As unregistered foreign industrial workers are deported from Korea after treatment, the disability benefits associated with industrial insurance are paid as a lump sum, not as a pension. For disability grades 4, such as Delanta, Korean workers are entitled to a pension of 245 matched daily wages each year. Assuming that Korean workers on the same salary as Dilanta live up to 80 years of age with a class of disability, approximately 11 times more compensation than foreigners receiving a lump sum. Dilanta returned to the airport in November 2011 in the Sri Lanka Bandaranaike. At the airport, his wife, Sudipa, was waiting. My wife took everything in stride. However, passers-by talked in whispers toward the couple or pointed fingers at the couple severely. The road turned black as the sun went down on the way from the airport to Panara's house. "" It was especially dark that evening, "" Dilanta said.A twisted life, one hope, and one hope, Dilanta opens her purse to a blind man begging in a train from Panadura Station to Columbo Station on October 2. Dilanta always wears a hat to cover the burn marks on her face when she goes out. / She looks at a fish while fixing a fish tank in her living room on October 1. Dilanta said, "" If you focus on the fish, you'll feel relaxed in the fishbowl. "" (Medium) / My daughter Sanudi said in her living room last October (middle) when she looked at the sofa. LED lights placed behind Sanudi are used in the event of a blackout, and due to chronic power shortages in Sri Lanka (below), they are burnt out in neighborhoods where ears and nose drops are lost in video. I can't find work without a finger. His life, which followed the Korean dream, was twisted out of proportion by an industrial disaster. His only hope is his family. Mr. and Mrs. Dillanta gave birth to Xanudi in 2014. The daughter was a token of friendship and loyalty for the couple. After giving birth to her daughter, Dilanta gradually dissociated herself from negative thoughts. A wife, son, and daughter who loves and comforts Dilanta are the pillars of his life. His wife Sudipa (right) weighs chicken on the morning of October 1 when she opened her first grocery store for a meal. And Dilanta was right."

Inducement of housing benefits to be delivered by the newly built housing market ... The housing supply level and demand for housing are announced by the Herald Business = Cheong Wa Dae's life support roadmap which was announced by the government - and government - party's - It aims to maximize the effects of its policies by designing them thoroughly centered on the consumers.The roadmap will create a detailed housing restoration network that will help us move from jobs to marriage and childbirth to the middle class, said Kim Tae-nyun, head of the fisherman party`s policy committee. In particular, the sluggish growth, low fertility and aging housing are putting a huge burden on the real`s needs with the social structure, and they will support rental housing, financial support and welfare services as a package.The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport initially said that it has no plans to develop new land. However, the new measures will provide new land for public housing in addition to the previously secured land for housing. The total volume of supply expansion for the homeless and needy amounts to one million. In particular, the apartments were designated as public rental number 650,000, public-supported private rental number 200,000, and public rental number 150,000."" We plan to expand public rental housing for the homeless with lower rental rates, and expand the size of public rental housing projects and expand the accommodation for them, "" said Land Minister Kim Hyun-mi.Conscious of a decline in the real estate market next year, construction companies are pushing back the volume of sales, but the barriers to enter are high. Apartment prices in Seoul are on the rise again, after being delayed due to measures to control of 8-2 and 10-24 household debt. According to Property 114, the price of apartments in Seoul increased by 1.28 % in November, an increase from last month's 1.01 %.Youth is the biggest obstacle to marriage and childbirth. The government and the ruling party decided to provide the homeless youth under the age of 39 with 300,000 apartments for small rental. It includes 130,000 public rental housing, 120,000 public-supported apartments, and 50,000 college students ' dormitories. In addition, it will provide more monthly loan support according to the needs of young people, and provide a savings account to support housing ladders by saving money by introducing a youth preferential subscription account.To support married couples, the government expanded rental housing and other support from the current "" married couple with less than five years "" to "" married childless couple and married couple with a prospective couple "" in seven years.

"The Korean government of reporter Im Han-byul is planning to advance the screening of credit companies beginning next January.The Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service announced Monday a follow-up measure to the comprehensive household debt rescue package, which would advance the credit scheme. The main idea is to reduce the maximum limit of additional loans for car owners with mortgage loans by half.With the introduction of a new DTI (debt-to-income ratio) regulation, all of the key and responsibilities of the new loan are reflected in calculating the repayment amount per year. Compared to the new shares that only reflected the principal and principal and interest rates, the limit of new shares will inevitably be decreased.In the second half of next year, the total debt service principal repayment rate (DSR) will be introduced. DSR is the figure by which the interest and the principal of all loans that the debtor has to repay during the year are calculated relative to income. Reflecting the ability of borrowers to repay loans at all households, credit ceilings are inevitable. A loan with a rental account can be exchanged with a rental deposit, so it includes only the amount of interest payment and is measured in installments over a period of 10 years, taking into consideration the maturity extension period of a credit such as a negative loan. It will be used as a credit management index to keep the ratio of DSR loans within a certain percentage of new household loans. The process of taking out loans from individual businesses is also becoming more tense. Financial institutions select more than three businesses to manage each year, and reduce the limit of loans for uncertain industries. In addition, real estate rental loans screening, which has recently increased in importance, is becoming more rigorous. If annual rental income falls short of annual lending rates, the ceiling on lending will be cut. The guidelines for individual business loans, which are to be introduced in March next year, set limits on the lending volume of loans to three or more companies that can manage them, taking into consideration the size of loans and the rate of their growth.In particular, the ratio of real estate rental interest payment (RTI) is calculated to assess the appropriateness of such loans. RTI says it divided rental income from rent into interest payments, and fails to pay interest on rent when less than one percent of rent is paid. Housing should have annual rental income of 1.25 times higher than interest costs and non-residential income of 1.5 times higher. The government estimated that 21.2 percent of rental housing loans and 28.5 percent of non-residential rental loans fall short of the standard.^ eased regulations on the loan of the real rich and the young, newly married couples, or the working class or the newly-married couple, should be eased. Young people (homeless below the age of 40) and newly married couples (within five years of marriage) adjust their future earnings higher than normal borrowers when acknowledging prospective incomes.If two mortgage loans are secured due to inevitable reasons, such as moving, when the existing home is disposed of immediately, only the interest rate will be reflected on the DTI but excluding the principal amount of existing home mortgage loans. If the former house is to be disposed of within two years and the existing home mortgage loans are to be repaid, the new loan will not be subject to a maturity limit (15 years).They are exempt from confirming their income and financial institutions will increase the limit on loans, taking into consideration their future income hikes. It is also a kind of additive. However, those who need the money will also reflect future earnings growth on their non-defensive repayment loans for 10 years or more. The limit of the increase was set by the banks on their own. We decided to limit the initial ceiling on the increase to 10 percent, but we deleted it, said Chang Jin-taek, FSS Deputy Director General, leaving room for the bank to add more loans depending on the situation of the car owners.◆ Real Estate Renters, Fixed or Variable Treasury Liabilities To ensure that real estate rental businesses will receive loans with variable interest rates or fixed rates according to stricter loan regulations. If the difference in interest rates between fixed and floating rate loans is less than one percentage point, it is expected that it would be better to take advantage of loans with fixed rates.For example, he would like to purchase the store in Seoul for 1 billion won with a deposit of 100 million won and a monthly rent of 3 million won with a 600 million won loan. When you look at the products of bank loans, the floating rate is 3.6 percent per year, and the flat rate is 4.1 percent per year.Her store's annual rent is 36 million won (3 million won, X 12 months). In addition, the interest gains from leaving 100 million won in deposit with the bank (100 million won × 1.56 percent bank time deposit rate) is considered as the annual rental income of 370,500,000 won (or 1.56 million won). If he takes out a loan with floating rate products, the interest expense for calculating the ratio of rental interest to repay the RTI will be 27.6 million won (600 million won X 4.6 percent). Interest rates are 3.6 percent, but the applied rates are calculated at 4.6 percent as a stress rate of one percentage point is added to the increase in interest rates.In this case, RTI is 1.36 times more expensive (37.56 million won / 27.6 million won), so it is difficult to lend up to 600 million won. It can borrow up to 540 million won, equivalent to 1.5 times the non-adder RTI standard.If the government pays the loan at a fixed rate, only 4.1 percent of the interest rate applies, making the interest cost 24.6 million won (600 million won X 4.1 percent) and the RTI 1.53 times (37.56 million won / 24.6 million won). In other words, they can borrow up to 611 million won.A bank official said, "" floating rate loans add up to at least 1 percentage point of stress to prepare for an increase in interest rates. "" Independent Correspondent namy85@mt.co.kr< Anhamun tycoon Cho Tae-oh is a man of the so-called "" first degree "" -- verbally abusive and abusive -- that believes money is stronger than the law. The same thing happened in reality. The third son of Hanwha Group Chairman Kim Seung-youn, 28, spoke to law firm lawyers at a drinking party and called him "" What are you doing with your father? "" "" Keep your back to the straight. "" He even slapped a drunk lawyer on the cheek and shook the hair of another lawyer. The incident last September nearly buried itself. The lawyers who were affected did not take such actions as criminal accusations. The law firm says it didn't even make any complaints. Why did the lawyers handling the law avoid a legal solution? Let me explain the reality of the lawyer's case and the limitations of the current law. ◇ Big law firms have also demonstrated in the first instance that "" never let go "" for their clients that lawyers are the absolute "" yes "" in their relationship with clients (customers and customers). Clients, on the other hand, are the ones that are called the "" A "", and especially the ones that are called the "" Super "" A "" for large enterprises. Why is a lawyer who is an expert in law doing? Based on the client, it is because the lawyer is a ' service ' provider. For law firms, the sense of crisis is that if you raise the problem, you could get dropped. The Hanhwa Group, including Kim, has been involved with the law firm for 10 years. The law firm has been in charge of several cases in Korea since 2007, when it took charge of a revenge attack on chairman Kim Seung-youn. Furthermore, the law firm has been dealing with not only Hanhwa but also major conglomerates. I think your failure to make any complaints about the attack reflected all of your connections with the major companies. If Hanwha is prosecuted, the law firm can determine that it is "" less loyal to its customers "" and that it can become an enemy at any time. The so-called equal responsibility of major conglomerates for what they call the top six law firms is to keep big law firms from becoming their enemies in times of crisis, although they have different competitive areas.◇ If the victim does not want to punish, the case is closed? ¡ ° Although Kim's actions are causing a stir, it is unclear whether they will lead to criminal charges. The lawyers don't want to formally punish Kim. Violence is the crime of anti-climaction, which can not be prosecuted if the victim does not want to take the rap. If you want to punish the words that Kim poured out on you for insulting people, you need to file a complaint with the victim. This is the limit of civil disobedience, which is distinguished from anti-classification. Kim and his lawyers say they are trying to avoid legal proceedings using gaps in the current law. "" When I apologized to the lawyers, I received an answer that was "" surprising but okay, "" Kim said. Lawyers said in a recent police probe that although there was an act of violence as reported by the media, they accepted Kim`s apology and no further damage. I would also like to visit each and make a sincere apology for my mistakes, Kim said in an apology, I will not be able to face the appropriate punishment, saying, I will actively consult and treat you. It appears that the charges against him are based on the fact that they are anti-climactic and pro-communist. However, if other charges apply, such as habitual assault or interference with the business, it could change the story. Because of this, police are concentrating their investigation on securing video footage of the incident and finding witnesses.

Complaints on internet blogs have been raised that Apple is over-profiting on the 10th anniversary of its iPhone release.The controversy over excessive profits came after IHS Market, a global market research firm, announced that it estimated the manufacturing cost of a 64GB model at $ 370.25 million, calculating the cost of Apple's iPhone X. That is because the cost of the products accounts for only 37 percent of the total cost based on the global unit price (999 dollars).The map analyzed the cost of producing the iPhone X with Korean experts. Local experts also questioned whether IHS Market is generally correct in its analysis, saying, It is fair to say that it is worth $ 300 more than the previous model, which was released for $ 699. Of course, product prices reflect invisible costs, such as cost of product, labor, marketing, research and development. However, the prevailing view was that the iPhone's price was too high. While some Korean experts have used new parts or expensive parts that were not included in other premium smartphones, combined, the cost increase was around $ 40, said an official who looked inside the iPhone X.◇ Product costs are around $ 40 '' higher than the iPhone X-Cost, mainly due to OLED displays, face-aware 3D sensors and bi-based batteries. The iPhone X created a screen covering the entire front panel, leaving only the top half of the screen. IHS Market estimates the price of its high-end display at $ 110. "" It would have cost more to grow the screen and make the shape sticking out on both sides, "" said a Korean expert on the same size panel, adding, "" It would have cost about $ 20 more to form Samsung Display Company. "" The face recognition sensor of the iPhone X was also analyzed to have raised its costs. Parts including an infrared camera that can recognize faces even at night and a 3D sensor that can measure wrinkles were priced at 16.7 dollars. The iPhone X also added two or three battery packs to its price. Other than the screen, battery and face recognition sensors, the rest are not significantly different from the parts in other similar products, Korean experts said. However, he said 47 screws were special. Local experts say, "" The average smartphone is equipped with bumps for perfect coupling with various parts and screws for only 7 to 8. "" Instead, the iPhone X uses the same process.◇ Higher than cost marketing factor, ’’ the price of smartphones has doubled in the past decade. When the iPhone was first launched in 2007, it cost $ 499 (about 540,000 won) and Samsung Galaxy S1 came out with its first product (about 650,000 won) in 2010.Apple, in particular, has raised consumer discontent by setting the iPhone X to priced at 1.14 million won, about 300,000 won higher than in the U.S. The magazine asked Apple Korea why the iPhone X is so priced at home, but did not answer. Manufacturers explain smartphones have become more sophisticated than smartphones that were 10 years ago. "" The storage capacity of the smartphone industry has grown from just 4GB to 256GB, and the size of the screen has grown from 3.5 inches to 6 inches, "" the smartphone makers said. All of the parts and materials have become high-end, forcing us to make our products more expensive, said an official at Samsung Economic Research Institute. As new technologies, such as cameras with more than 10 million pixels in color and fingerprints, iris and face recognition, are added, the manufacturing process is becoming increasingly difficult.However, some critics say Apple is enjoying a substantial amount of excess profit based on its strong market dominance. Apple's iPhone business reported operating profit of 30 percent last year, three times larger than Samsung's smartphone business.A telecom official said, "" We have been constantly criticized for our "" bold sales "" such as transferring inconvenient after-services policies or advertising expenses to operators, but the iPhone's domestic market share has always remained around 10 percent.
