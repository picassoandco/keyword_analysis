As the minimum wage increase inevitably requires higher administrative costs, the two residents will vote for the bill.The plan includes raising wages to the lowest hourly wage range of 7530 won starting this year, and increasing recess by one and a half hours and adjusting the number of workers. As a result of the referendum, 68 percent of the residents voted to raise their wages, and six guards and street cleaners decided to keep their jobs free of any changes in working hours. Residents are required to pay an extra 9000 won per month in administrative costs, but the result is a consensus that ' people before costs '.Liber Sweet, 69, head of the local autonomous government, said, Labor hikes were also inevitable due to the rise in minimum wage, adding, There is a growing burden on residents who have to manage their own businesses.The decision appears to be a way to coexist as a result of collecting opinions from residents, the residents said, as security guards are a part of the community and they share the same opinion. A questionnaire featuring residents of Liber Sweet Apartments in Taehwa-dong, Jung-gu, Ulsan. Local news agency officials say, "" I don't want to know how much money the monthly social security committee in Apgujeong-dong would have to pay to fire 94 million people. "" Bakdalseo (63), the security manager, said, "" I was more than thankful and encouraged to let the residents consider the guards as a member of the community, "" and added, "" It would be a little bit of a pride and a bit of help for the residents. Kim Da-eun (31, female), who took part in the referendum, said, "" It is natural for employers to raise wages based on minimum wage hikes, so it is only natural that we should pay less than 1000 won per household in wages. "" I do not mind paying the expenses for the guards, Kim said, adding, I am always grateful to those who work calmly.▶ View the news and photo on PyeongChang 2018.

""" Let's Go to Gangnam, "" a housing price hike by local big names again, a roaring real estate market in Gangnam, and a boom in Gangnam, Gangwon Province, and a boom in apartment prices at sannae@donga.comIt is a joke among real estate agents in Gangnam area in Seoul these days. Financial people living in Ulsan or Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, say they "" have to move in case of an earthquake or go to Gangnam. "" “‘The lion house in Seoul’, Roh Moo-hyun government, and ‘Lion house in Gangnam’ these days it would have been there by bus and came up again.” is talking about a mixed response. Home prices have risen throughout the country, including throughout the city in the Roh Moo-hyun's administration because they are concentrated at Gangnam in now. In fact, the real estate market in southern Seoul is heating up. K, 48, director of real estate B, whom we met on July 11, said, "" We have so many questions that we haven't been able to properly eat lunch in a month or two, "" adding, "" Too many people wanted to buy apartments in Gangnam. While talking to the reporter, the office phone and the phone calling him rang constantly. He said, I worked without holidays, but I had only two days off at the beginning of the year. But the new two days, the prices rose by 50 million won, said (the rise). A few days ago, a buyer decided to put 50 million won down and make a contract the next day, but a buyer said, "" The seller might change his or her mind overnight, "" and added, "" I have to go with a down payment. "" It is also becoming more popular to collect sales figures. An apartment in Banpo-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul, sold for 2.05 billion won late last December. About ten days have passed before a buyer has appeared. However, no deal was made. It is because the owners collected the sale. At first, we wanted our landlord to sell us the item quickly, but when they said, let's close the deal, the brokerage head of S-Property in Seoul, J-Project quoted us 2.2 billion won. Amid this sentiment, housing prices in Gangnam are showing an upward trend. Until last September, the price of apartments in Daechi-dong, Gangnam-gu traded at 1.69 billion won (2.08 million U.S. dollars) was surpassed by about 2.02 billion won (2.08 million dollars) in December. Currently, the bid is estimated at 2.1 billion won, but the sale has disappeared. The nearby apartment price of Jogok-dong Reksul also rose from 1.4 billion won to 1.6 billion won in December last year. According to Kookmin Bank, the average price per square meter of apartments in Gangnam-gu rose more than 3 percent from 129.8 million won on December 11 last year to 134.1 million won on July 8, exceeding the 13 million won mark for the first time. In a weekly survey conducted by real estate 114, Songpa-gu (1.19 %) and Gangnam-gu (1.03 %) were also raised by more than 1 % in the second week of January. It is the highest since November 10, 2006. As a result, the price of apartments in Seoul jumped 0.57 percent from the previous week. Such a situation was predicted to be somewhat immediately after the inauguration of the incumbent administration. Expectations were also high that the price of apartments in Gangnam would be raised again. Restrictive property regulations at the time Roh Moo-hyun government to boosting the supply is shrinking, apartment prices in Gangnam as an analysis based on the learning experience. My expectation was right. “Recently, a nearby business get together with the representative of the situation in these days and ‘Roh Moo-hyun government in junior year of the season’ agreed that”, a licensed real estate agent, a representative in Gangnam said. The term "" seasonally-2 "" also implies that although the pattern is similar to that of the season, the aggressive behavior is more serious. It has been a long time since apartments in Gangnam were considered ' real estate luxury. ' The educational environment is so good that it is called an "" education special zone "" in a convenient and pleasant life infrastructure. Still, it has been relatively stable in recent years. It is the incumbent administration that stimulated real estate prices in Gangnam. First of all, various measures to stabilize the real estate market, including targeting multiple home owners, have sparked off a nationwide campaign. A growing number of people have gathered in Gangnam apartments to sell several and leave only one. It's a piece of cake. Real estate analyst Park Won-gap at KB Kookmin Bank said, We are moving to purchase cash-building apartments in Gangnam, where even local asset owners have assets. The policy of autonomous high schools (private high schools) and foreign language high schools (foreign language high schools) to be adopted starting from the end of this year also affected. Parents who seek quality education are paying more attention to Gangnam area. The first and second graders policy of Chong-ho, Lim Sung-ho, said, will break the psychological barrier of parents who live outside of Gangnam and send their children to good schools. An expert in education “The government has been going backwards to take the Gangnam '.”, saying, “Gangnam, criticizes the blow to prevent the Lee Myung-bak introduced at the government policy.” high.Criticism. The prolonged low interest rate, the stock market boom, and the thriving virtual currency market also helped to fire up the overheated Gangnam property market. Investors with ` live ammunition ` are flocking to Gangnam real estate, a safe asset. According to the Bank of Korea, the amount of money spent in the market was 2522 trillion won as of the end of November last year, the largest ever. A string of major development benefits, such as the opening of SRT from the office and the promotion of the Global Business Center (GBC), also attracted investors to Gangnam. Kim Hak-ryul, director of the Research Group's real estate research center, said, "" The three districts have more than 1.5 million jobs, including the headquarters of big businesses, and have no good facilities for cutting down on apartments, good schools, and transportation. "" As demand grows, the supply and demand index of housing sales in Gangnam 4 (Gangnam, Seocho, Songpa, and Gangdong districts) increases sharply. According to the Korea Institute of Audit and Inspection, the supply and demand index for the four districts of Gangnam stood at 116.7 last December, the highest since July 2012, when figures were first compiled. It is 9.3 points higher than the previous month. This year, the number of respondents was also on the rise to 121.1 (time of day 1·examination) and 122.5 (day 8). This number means that the larger than 100 the demand is greater than the supply. However, the supply is far from sufficient. According to Property 114, the total number of apartments in Gangnam, Seocho and Songpa districts last year was only about 4300, down 30 percent from the previous year (6,620). It was the lowest volume in five years. The volume of new homes will grow to 15,000 this year, but it will shrink to 4,800 by 2019. Experts agree that expanding supply and dispersion of demand should be implemented simultaneously to stabilize the Gangnam real estate market. Kim Deok-rye, director of the Housing Research Institute at the Korea Housing Industry Institute, said, We need to improve land use regulations that were created in the early 2000s so that new apartments could be supplied in Seoul. We need to adjust the pace so that the simultaneous reconstruction of homes in Gangnam is as well as encouraging a rise in house prices, said Jin Mi-yoon, an economist at the Korea Housing Institute. Shim Kyo-eon, a real estate professor at Konkuk University, advised, "" Loosen the greenbelt belts in Seongnam, Hanam, Kyonggi Province, and Gwacheon to use them as land sites. "" We need to consider encouraging the Gangnam area to move large businesses out of Seoul, suggested Kim Hak-ryul, a director of the think tank.Hwang Jae-seong, Kim Ji-young and Kang Seong-hwI, Korea Times ' official Facebook page, etc., and the Chinese government banned the recycling of waste paper and recycling of waste paper (click!), and the U.S. Department of Waste and other waste products are banned from recycling. As China decided to ban waste imports, waste disposal sites in Britain began to accumulate a great deal of waste, and countries in Europe and North America, including Ireland, Germany, and Canada, are in a similar situation, the New York Times (NYT) reported on Tuesday. The watersheds in Hong Kong and other port cities are also piling up of recycling waste. It is a phenomenon that occurred when China, the world`s largest recycling waste disposal country, banned the import of waste starting on July 1. China has begun banning the import of 24 kinds of solid waste. China has disposed of 7.3 million tons of waste and imported and processed metal and waste plastic in 2016, half of the world`s recycling waste. In fact, the whole world relies on China to dispose of recycling waste. China, however, reported to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in July last year that it would impose a waste import restriction due to environmental protection and health and hygiene measures. The Chinese government claimed that dirty and dangerous waste mixed in with recycled waste or seriously contaminated the environment during the cleaning process. A British waste disposal company official was also concerned, "" There will be a waste dump throughout the UK in the coming months. "" Britain exports recycling waste to China every year to fill 10,000 Olympic swimming stadiums. The U.S. also sends 13.2 million tons of waste plastic to China every year and 1.14 million tons of waste plastic. "" The whole world is having a hard time, not just Britain, "" said an official at the British recycling society. As it is difficult for countries to find a way to dispose of recycling waste in a short time, experts say they have no choice but to dispose of waste incineration and landfill. However, the environmental impact is so great that the waste turmoil around the world is likely to continue for quite some time. Plans are being made to reduce waste. U.K. Prime Minister Terrisamey announced yesterday that the plastic bag payment system would be expanded to all retail outlets from the current large discount stores, and that it would not provide plastic packaging to supermarkets. The European Union is considering imposing taxes on plastic bags and other packaging materials."

According to the results of the census conducted by the National Statistical Office on August 13, the unemployment rate in 2017 was 4.0 % of those who graduated from university or higher, 0.2 % higher than those who were found to have graduated from high school (3.8 %). It was the first time last year that the jobless rate among college graduates and higher than those of high school graduates was recorded at the current level in 2000.The employment information bulletin of a university in downtown Seoul on August 9, 2017 [Yonhap news report] shows a 1.2 % gap between high school graduates and those with higher than 3.7 % educational backgrounds compared to 2000 and 2016. The total unemployment rate in 2017 was 3.7 percent, and that of those who graduated from university or higher was 0.3 percent higher. It is the third time that the unemployment rate of college graduates or higher than the overall unemployment rate in 2017, following the difference of 0.4 percent in 2002 and 0.2 percent in 2013. Unemployment in the nation's jobless population was higher than those of high school graduates. As of last year, the number of unemployed college graduates or higher was 502,000, more than 90,000 than those with high school diplomas (409,000).Ten universities in the northeastern part of Seoul held on November 7, 2017 at Duksung Women's University in Seoul are seeking job counseling by job seekers at the Employment Festival. The authorities analyzed that the rise in unemployment of those who graduated from higher education or higher in college was influenced by the overall society. Among people aged 15 and over, the number of those with higher education increased from 651,600 in 2016 to 165,613,000 in 2017, while those with higher education in colleges and universities rose from 156,000 to 163,000 during the same period. In 2017, the number of students with higher education in economics, activity, and population increased by 0.1 % compared to the previous year, and those with higher education by 3.1 %. The demand and supply levels in the job market are also blamed for higher unemployment among college graduates and those with higher levels of education. The report says that there are insufficient jobs for college graduates and colleges and universities and the demand for workers is high, but that highly educated job seekers are reluctant to work. Bin Hyun-jun, director of the Employment Statistics Division at the National Statistical Office, interpreted that the recent situation appeared to be also related to the increase in college graduates, as they lacked the jobs available. sewonlee@yna.co.kr and inquiry, press and 1:1 chatting on behalf of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics video conspirator watch an electronic bulletin board on the wall of the virtual currency exchange in Myeongdong, Seoul, yesterday. Financial authorities plan to implement the real-name virtual currency transaction system as scheduled. The Ministry of Justice has threatened to enact a special law to ban virtual currency transactions altogether, but it can not afford to leave the market until then as it is uncertain not only when the law will go into effect but also when it will be enforced. A Financial Services Commission official said yesterday, "" There is no change in the financial authorities ` policy of enforcing the real-name policy on virtual currency transactions within this month. "" To that end, the Financial Services Commission called in working-level officials of six banks - Industrial Bank of Korea, Kookmin Bank, Gwangju Bank, National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, Shinhan Bank and Hana Bank - who had been preparing to introduce a real-name transaction. After Justice Minister Bahk Sang-kee said, We are preparing a special law to ban virtual currency transactions aimed at shutting down virtual currency exchanges, the bank immediately launched an overhaul of the banks ` move to delay introducing of a real-name verification system. "" It is true that banks have a lot of trouble (due to Minister Park's remarks), "" said an official at the Financial Services Commission, adding, "" All six banks are preparing their real names well, "" adding that they would use the government policy to confirm their real names. The government is setting a goal to introduce the real-name system by the end of this month according to its policy to introduce a virtual currency transaction system on July 28. It is said that it will allow the payment and withdrawal of transactions between the two bank accounts that have been verified by their real names and the same bank accounts on the virtual currency exchange. Virtual accounts, the bank's corporate accounts, which were formerly widely used for virtual currency transactions have been suspended since Dec. 28 last year. Financial authorities plan to prepare guidelines for preventing bank laundering to broker virtual currency transactions. The Financial Information Analyst (FIU) and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) have been keeping an eye on corporate and national banks, National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, Industrial Bank, Shinhan Bank, and Woori Bank since July 8 to ensure that virtual currency transaction accounts are properly issued. The investigation was originally scheduled for July 11, but it was extended by five more days until July 16, and the announcement of the guidelines has been postponed. Financial Services Commission Chairman Choi Jong-koo drinks while explaining the background of an on-site inspection of the bank's virtual account on the virtual currency exchange at a briefing held at Seoul National University on July 8. The problem with the combined news is that if the virtual currency transaction is discontinued altogether as the Minister of Justice, the computerized system established by the bank for real-name transaction will be useless. Although the presidential office has begun to evolve, "" The establishment of a special law to ban virtual currency transactions is a decision only by the Justice Ministry, not final, "" the ban on virtual currency transactions is still a live card. That is where the uncertainty remains. But financial officials say, Even if the government decides to enact a special law, it would take six months to pass the National Assembly and enforce it, and it would not have been possible to make a deal with the public by then, saying, It would have taken more than a year to complete. I will explain the guidelines to banks to prevent money laundering and continue talking.Park Jong-oh (pjo22@edaily.co.kr)"
"Banks are advised to step up their criticism of the stricter implementation of the real-name policy on July 12. As the Financial Services Commission decides whether to release the voluntary resumption of the system, the Financial Services Commission will issue a virtual account with interest in the virtual currency at the end of this month. Justice Minister Bahk Sang-kee, who said he would close the virtual currency exchange, decided to allow new investors to enter the country on the condition that their real names are confirmed. Until the morning of July 12, major banks delayed the implementation of their original virtual currency real-name transaction system, saying, We don`t have a deadline for when we can introduce the system. We should keep an eye on the government's regulations. Shinhan Bank sent an official letter to each exchange office that said it would suspend the deposit of virtual accounts at the three virtual currency exchange, including Bitsham, Cobbit and Iya Labs, making even existing virtual accounts useless. As the government strongly responded to the decision to close the exchange, it was analyzed that banks are backing away from virtual accounts. However, the mood was reversed when the Financial Services Commission decided to complete the introduction of the real-name transaction system and the issuance of new virtual accounts at the end of this month in its meeting. Once a real-name system is adopted, investors can only make an deposit into an exchange account using their own account with their real names verified. Only the same bank can do business. The government's plan is to allow the inflow of new investment funds, as the transparency of transaction funds increases. We found no problems with the real-name transaction system prepared by banks, said an official at the Financial Services and Information Institute. Many analysts say that the sudden change in the government's attitude toward virtual currencies is due to strong opposition from investors. More than 4,000 virtual call-related petitions were posted on the presidential web site's public petition board. Most of them criticized the government for tightening regulations. A worker, identified by his surname Kang, who made about 200 million won from the fake currency surge but lost about 40 million won in just one day after Minister Park Sang-gi said on July 11, adding, It is a government that can afford to pay a lot of money to the working class. Due to the nature of the market, the market is likely to shake again when new virtual accounts are opened. The virtual currency market moved at a snail's pace whenever government or bank action was announced. Bitcone prices, which had dropped to around 14.8 million won since Minister Park's remarks on July 11, rebounded to 21.24 million won after an explanation from Cheong Wa Dae. As the measure was revealed on July 12, it plunged to around 18.5 million won, but then again broke the 20 million won mark at 4 p.m. Because of this, some worry that the market will get hotter due to the resumption of new virtual account issuance.▽ Hwang Tae-ho, taeho@donga.com & Lee Ji-hun = Donga-bo = If Facebook officially displays an economic issue with hot and the results of retailing the Internet, it will be redistributed to the Asia Times, and updated the performance of the mobile phone with the latest version of the iPhone.IT professional media Gismodo et al on July 12 (local time) stated that the iPhone 6 experienced a maximum performance penalty of 40 % after being tested on iOS 11.2.2 for ' Meltdown ' and ' Spector ' security vulnerabilities patch.Apple distributed updates to iOS 11.2.2 earlier this week and recommends installing them on all iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch to help prevent security breaches.

Meanwhile, the first terminal, which is losing its number of customers due to the opening of the second terminal, is likely to be withdrawn from Lotte Duty Free and is in turmoil because negotiations over the rent reduction have yet to be concluded. According to the industry on July 13, Lotte, Shilla and Shinsegae, Korea`s duty-free shop industry, will operate stores in the newly opened terminal. Lotte Duty Free Shop has about 130 brands of liquor and tobacco products. The six brands - Valentine, Royal Salut, Hennessy, Johnny Walker, KT&G ; Lille, Philip Morris Ikos and others - set up a large flagship store. Silla Duty Free Store was established as an "" experience-type duty free shop "" for cosmetics and perfume stores. The six brands, Chanel, Dior, Lancome, Estee Lauder, SK-II, and Sulhouse, respectively, provide virtual reality (VR) experience and skin measurement services. Shinsegae Duty Free offers about 170 brands including fashion, watches, jewelry and sunglasses. It has attracted many luxury brands including Chanel, the airport's duty-free shop, Gucci, Prada, Chloe, PendI and Saint Laurent, all of which are to be opened in three years. Each duty-free shop is planning to boost its atmosphere with various discount events to celebrate its opening. Ha Sa-heon : Officials prepare to open a duty-free shop at Incheon International Airport, one week before the second passenger terminal is opened on July 18. According to the airline that provided the air force with heaven (2018.1.11), last year's sales at Incheon International Airport were $ 2.1 billion, the world's biggest in sales at the airport's duty-free shop for two consecutive years. Unlike the busy 2-terminal duty-free shop that opens before the market, however, the existing 1-terminal terminal is slightly under construction. Korean Air Co., Korea`s largest carrier, KLM Air France Inc. and Delta Airlines will move to Terminal 2. After the THAAD (high-altitude missile defense system) incident, Chinese group tourists have not recovered. Lotte, Shilla and Shinsegae Duty Free Shop are also operating in Terminal 1. Reflecting the reduction of the number of customers who use the terminal as a result of its opening, Incheon International Airport Corporation is negotiating with operators of the terminal's duty-free shop to adjust the rent. The corporation originally planned to close the negotiation before the opening of the second terminal, but negotiations are still underway. Once negotiated, rent will be applied retrospectively. Negotiations for the adjustment of rent at Lotte Duty Free and Incheon Airport have not progressed. Negotiations between the two sides have virtually been suspended, and Lotte Duty Free Shop is also expected to declare its withdrawal from the first terminal after late February. As we will see by opening the doors, we expect to see a significant portion of sales at the 2-terminal duty-free stores, said an official at the duty-free shop for the first terminal when the number of Chinese tourists increase. double@yna.co.kr"
"Choi Hae-min, a reporter at Yonhap News Agency, studies virtual currency investment, and coin characteristics, saying, "" I'm like gambling. I'm worried about my 50 or more real estate and stock holders. "" (Suwon = Yonhap) People in their 20s or 30s, who are leading the investment in virtual currencies, study the coin if it is "" fresh "" among 1,000 coins and look at it as a worthy investment target.Whereas the older people in their 50s and older who are accustomed to traditional investment, such as stock and real estate, are at risk of criticizing the virtual currency market as a speculation board and, in turn, a gambling table. Some worry that virtual currency may serve as a trigger for conflicts between households. A, a 30-something worker at a small company, entered the virtual currency market early last year and is earning quite high profits. "" I was thinking about where to put my paycheck in the bank account, since I was earning just slightly more than 30 million won a year, "" he said, adding, "" I was thinking about investing it in what I was going to do with virtual coins. "" The news, it added, was only a negative view of virtual currencies but around me, there are many people who work hard and study block chains at odd moments and make sound investment. A 20-something businessman working for a large company said, "" It is just because of Korea's basic conditions as an Internet powerhouse, such as the high speed Internet and mobile, "" adding, "" Maybe we need to get a virtual currency that Koreans have. "" As the company successfully invests in virtual currencies, the experiences of investors who turned themselves in to their own companies are also being told frequently. Meanwhile, among older generations who do not know relatively well about virtual currencies or block chains, they are nervous about investing in virtual currency. There is also a story of parents who find out that their children invested in virtual currency and decide it later.▽ Bitcone Bubble 〓 A while ago, an official in his 30s called me and said, "" I think you got a message from your father in the countryside, and the virtual currency is more unstable, so I think you shouldn't invest in any virtual currency. "" I was especially concerned about investment because it was not one to two million won but tens of millions to hundreds of millions of won I spent at a time to make a fortune, said D, an office worker in my 50s. I don't think virtual money is real, but I don`t think it is a gambling place because it is so expensive, said E, who also judged that the government was highly speculative in the virtual currency market. The anxiety of the older generation has intensified after reports that the government has decided to shut down the virtual currency exchange. Nevertheless, the young generation's enthusiasm for investing in virtual currency is unrelenting. A virtual currency exchange poll of 4,000 users showed that 29 percent of the users in their 20s and 30s, or nearly 60 percent, were surveyed last November. People in their 40s ranked second with 20 percent, and those in their 50s ranked third with 12 percent. Young people who choose virtual money as their future investment destination are in a different position from the older generation who insist on traditional investment methods such as real estate and stocks. A survey of 941 employers surveyed by a job matching platform owner at the end of last year revealed that 31.3 percent of them are investing in virtual currency. Their investment in virtual currency averages 56.6 million won per person. It is not enough to invest in real estate held by the elderly, but the number of young people who can invest in virtual currency with only a small amount of money is increasing. As of the end of last year, the percentage of Bitcone App users was highest at 32.7 percent, followed by 20 to 24 percent, and 21 to 21 percent, and 15.8 percent to 50 percent. The app user's daily use time was 26 minutes, double the time of the stock app (13 minutes), and the execution count was 67 times, more than four times that of the securities app (15 times), showing interest in virtual currency than stock. Experts say such a difference is being created due to the generation gap in information related to virtual currency.

"" Ten out of 12 people were rescued, but A and B in their 50s and 20s were dead. They found the body of the deceased, but failed to find the body of the deceased. "" It is originally a boat with five passengers on it, but it appears (North Korean defectors) broker overrode 12 people to save money and had an accident, "" a North Korean source said.The group left Shandong Province in China earlier this month and arrived in Laos crossing the border from Yunnan Province. Normally, defectors from China are headed to Korea via China → Laos → Thailand → Korea, and when they arrive in Thailand, the danger of sending to North Korea disappears. He ran 3000km but was poisoned before the safety zone. According to sources, an ethnic Korean defector from Chongjin, North Hamgyong Province escaped from North Korea two years ago and was sold to Chinese men. After learning of the recent outbreak of mammary cancer, he decided to go to Korea for treatment. A said, "" I have been sent to North Korea because I was arrested by the Chinese police when I was in China after I escaped from North Korea.The video released by human rights groups showed Talbukmin members shouting, "" Now I'm going to Korea! "" on the bus, and they loved it. The South Korean human rights group that helped the defectors said, "" I also have a letter from China. "" I would like to ask for cancer treatment and live in South Korea as a human. "" "" I was free when I crossed the river, and it hurt me, "" said an official of the group. Women who died were not reported to have any family members in Korea.Various accidents are involved in the escape process. North Korean defector Kim In-kook (alias), who entered the South in 2010, said, "" When I rush around at night to avoid surveillance, I have a high risk of a car accident. "" "" The Mekong River has not only had a case of a ferry rollover accident. ""The number of defectors who once reached 2,900 a year (2009) has decreased since Kim Jong-un took office in 2012. The reason is North Korea's strengthening border control and worsening relationship between North Korea and China. Nevertheless, more than 1,000 North Korean defectors stay in the South each year. Last year, there were 1,127. As of the end of December last year, a cumulative number of defectors from the South were 31,399. "
"We don`t think Chung Jae-seung, a physics professor at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), was able to answer the criticism that Rhyu Si-min was strongly critical of the cryptograph (so called virtual currency) frenzy again. Chung posted a longer article on his Facebook account on July 13, saying, I didn`t think my two lines of comment on Professor Rhyu Si-min's interview with the cipher message would turn out to be a newspaper article. First, Chung Jae-seung, head of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, said, We are all very concerned about the overheating and wild wave of encrypted money, and there is no difference here. And "" More importantly, to solve this problem wisely, not only harm the public, but also consider the possibility of widespread use of encrypted currency and block chain technologies in the future. "" "" We shouldn't let stocks get stuck in the stock market because they've overheated, and we shouldn't end up with an Internet bubble that won't let the stock market crash out, "" said Zuckerberg. In the article, he criticized Yoo more accurately. He said, We were concerned because Lee`s interview was made up of not just a frenzy of cipher currency, but a fundamental degradation of block chains and cipher strengths. "" Sea Story, "" he said. Rhyu Si-min, author of last December, jtbc ‘war of words’ in the Bitcoin fever ‘tulip bubble’ in the Netherlands and Roh Moo-hyun administration compared to ‘The Sea Story’. He also said, "" Since block chains are platforms for crypto-money, excessive regulation of crypto-money utilization did not fundamentally limit the utilization of block chains. "" - And the block chain's business code is not just about Finally, Chung said that the government's solution to view cipher money and block chains as "" social evils, "" such as the close of the exchange, should be approached in a way that would wipe out overheated speculation. It is not right, beneficial or possible for the nation to excessively control the technology in the long run, he added. Professor Chung Jae-seung directly denounced the remarks made by author Rhyu Si-min on his Twitter. Professor Chung previously stated on his Twitter that Yoo would have written an interview with a JoongAng Ilbo article and said, "" If you don't know how to rebut your own words, you're going to get a better argument.

And when asked if the current assessment of encrypted money is at odds with regard to ' speculative capital-block chain industry promotion, ' many strange people answered, "" gamble with the engineers ' ideas.

Meanwhile, Vice Speaker Park Joo-sun, floor leader Kim Dong-cheol, former floor leader Joo Seung-yong, and Congressman Hwang Joo-hong have been trying to mediate between the two sides of the group. They said, Under no circumstances should the National Party be broken. The arbitration panel has prepared a mid-term report that includes Ahn's early exit from the party leadership and fair management of the group through outside the neutral zone. Things started to change when Ahn rejected the idea when he met with the Chinese media on July 10. After leaving the conference during the ruling party committee on July 12, floor leader Kim told reporters, I also believe unity is a long way from the beginning, but the procedures and methods of unification are very wrong. Stop the integration right now. He also said he can not cooperate with the national convention. In contrast, former floor leader Joo and his closest aide were reportedly determined to step up efforts to unite. They showed their presence side by side at the Yeosu International Marathon on July 7. Vice Speaker Park and Rep. Hwang plan to intervene until the day before the national convention. Once a proper integration is established with the political parties, they will likely remain in the UNDP or refuse to join the new party as an independent group and will have to worry about their future plans. Most of the members of the ruling and opposition camps have the Jeolla provinces as their district, and the plan to run for local elections in June or 13, and the political consensus on how to observe the unity and opposition parties, are not. The picture shows us when the JTBC program China was program.[Centrapher] said, "" Cryptographer money was used for making fun of human stupidity and took money away from central phone calls with someone during an interview on July 12.

Q : What do you think of the current cipher suite? A : It's a wild gale. It's crazy. Insanity. Everyone .... Q : Do you feel frustrated? A : I can not help feeling the folly of human beings. It is considered to be the "" speculative frenzy "" of human history many times. There is no greater meaning than the 21st century version of the tulip bubble. Using human folly, it is now a process in which someone plays a joke and takes money away from it. There are charlatans from all over the world here. But now even Korean high school students are paying their own money. Until the bubble bursts, people will live. Then the last ones to catch will be ruined. Don't blame the government or society for the people who have just jumped in the ring and lost money, this message should be given for sure. It's not up to anyone, and it's not the state that created the market on the system. Q : Did justice minister Park Sang-kee, who announced his decision to close the exchange, think he was right? A : I don't think I can comment. The Government will deal with it well. Cheong Wa Dae said it was concerned about the market confusion, not a definite decision. I'm just watching the news. There is no conflict between ministries, no idea is currently being worked out at the office, no discussion has been made about it, and no information has been made on it. Therefore, it is impossible to judge the government's confusion. Graphic : journalist Park Kyung-min : The issue seems to have conflicting views on the regulation of speculative capital and the promotion of the block chain industry. A : I'm sorry, but I think such claims are all deception. Cryptography is not an economic term ; it's simply about people gambling with a lot of the weird toys that are shown by engineers ' ideas. After hearing that they have money, people flock to them with large bundles of money as if they were moth. Q : There are many people who say Korea should develop its block-chaining technology further. A : There are many media reports talking about block-chaining technology as if the nation was lagging behind the fourth industrial revolution when it didn't give up, and I doubt them. Maybe they want to make a profit out of the encrypted currency. What is the difference from opening up casinos throughout the nation? If I say anything negative, I would say that I don't know about the new fourth industrial revolution, which is all about chasing a mirage. I honestly don't blame some of the media for encouraging this. Not all of these people put money in it, I think so. Q : Tens of thousands of messages are said to be against the regulation of cipher strengths on the presidential office's petition. A : They're all charmers. "" I have to make money, "" I said. Q : The presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae seems cautious about the market confusion. A : The government should make sure that all Korean citizens come out with a good deal of money. And all cash flow to overseas accounts through virtual currency investment should be blocked. It could be the government's fault if the government does nothing to protect citizens from the turbulence. So it is time for the government, intellectuals and the media to make it clear not to jump in. At the end of the interview, Yoo said, "" I want to reiterate the fact that the government needs to make sure not to jump into a speculative frenzy and that people who have been down-at-heel don't have the right to blame the government.

In the Republic of Korea, virtual money is considered as a way out and a dream of miserable reality before it is a futuristic technology at the start of the 2018 New Year. While some described virtual money as an irrational speculation, it is actually the only viable option and the only viable option for young people suffering from job insecurity and student debt payment, said Kim Seok-ho, a sociology professor at Seoul National University. Professor of sociology at Korea University Yoon In-jin said, It is hard for Korean society to expect success through savings, real estate investment, and stocks, which is the usual method of accumulating wealth, so we have become addicted to the lottery. In fact, last year's Lotto sales hit an all-time high. Professor of psychology at Sogang University Na Jin-kyung said, As research results showed that members prefer high-return and high-risk investment, it is hard to believe that the Korean society is likely to grow more unstable and that Korean youth will no longer be able to take jobs or get corrupt admissions. There is anger in investor outcry. Kim Ji-ho, a professor of psychology at Kyungpook National University said, One of the voices is, "" We earned money from real estate. The feeling of deprivation and anger is also common among middle-aged people. I studied, worked, and lived my life to the fullest, but the reality is very hard. "" (A co-worker) asked me for coins.

So, I just want to spend a year and eat beef cold with the money…I felt as if my voice was actually bigger than my mouth and my friend's was even more nervous about it, "" said Clean Virtualization, an economist at the board of Justice and Economy and Economy Minister. Some high-ranking officials have even criticized the virtual money bubble as being the most valuable asset to multiple homeowners. Bae Kyu-han, an honorary professor at Kookmin University, said, It is uncertain whether ordinary people will get a job, whether they will be able to make a lot of money on their salary, and whether they will be able to make a lot of money out of it. Virtual currency transaction prices, which had dropped sharply, returned to their normal prices in one day. Professor Kim Seok-ho predicted that the virtual currency boom would continue unless the overall conditions that led to the fever change. According to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on July 12 (local time), the Korean government has decided to impose a ban on U.S. exports of Korean products as the U.S. failed to comply with the WTO Disputes Resolution Organization (DSB) decision within a reasonable timeframe. Korea has estimated that the anti-dumping duties of the U.S. were damaged by the amount of $ 311 million (760 billion won), and has decided to impose a duty on U.S.-made goods by that amount. The United States imposed an anti-dumping and countervailing duty on washing machines made and exported by Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics in Korea in February 2013, respectively, with the Korean government filing a final suit with the WTO in September 2016. The WTO judged that the U.S. added up the dumping margin only when the export price was lower than the domestic price, and the U.S. imposed the dumping margin when the export price was higher than the domestic price (negative dumping), inflating the overall dumping margin. Soothing violates the WTO anti-dumping agreement. As the Zeroing system was put to a halt, the U.S. used a Korean-made washing machine as its first example and imposed tariffs on it, but it also lost. Washington had to abide by the WTO ruling by Dec. 26 last year, but after no action was taken, Seoul requested it allow the WTO to impose punitive duties again, depending on its authority. Korea's filing for punitive duties is expected to be dealt with at the DSB conference on July 22, but the U.S. will likely object to the calculation and ask for arbitration, and if the arbitration process goes through, approval is expected in a few months. The Korean government is considering selecting products to levy on the Korean government, considering the market conditions when it approves the punitive duties.▽ Korean Nada-launder (Yonhap) minor@yna.co.kr 2018.1.12 jjaeck9@yna.co.kr( = Han Ji Hoon, Yonhap News Agency) reporters are right, Seoul, Uidang-myeon political parties opposed to integration with national lawmakers on September 13, the consolidation drive the Ahn Cheol-soo.At out harsh criticism in unison.

"The future of virtual currency [Omai News Shinsangho], which looks back on ' History of Money, ' often involves two histories. Gold standard and tulip bubble. An optimist believes virtual currency will act as a key currency, like gold or dollar, in the long run. The pessimist says it is the bubble that will blow soon like the Dutch tulip bubble of the seventeenth century. It is not wrong, nor is it right. The present virtual currency phenomenon has something in common with the tulip bubble and the gold standard, respectively, and is different. In terms of excessive speculative demand, it is used as a tulip bubble, as a currency, and looks like gold when it comes to output. The "" tulip "" and "" virtual currency "" Netherlands tulip bubbles, which everyone visited with a bundle of money, were bubbles that erupted in the 1600s. Along with the South Sea bubble in Britain and the Mississippi bubble in France, it is called the third biggest bubble in the nation's classical economic history. The history of the tulip bubble begins when the phytologist Charles de Leclouset brings it from Turkey to Europe in 1593.The "" speculation "" frenzy against tulips begins when the tulips are enjoyed by the Dutch aristocracy and other upper-class, and a variety of crops are also grown. The target was a tulip's "" almuri "". At that time, the nobles, merchants and maids began to speculate on tulips.  In 1636, when the tulip bubble reached its peak, the price of tulips are more than halved. The most expensive tulip at the time, the Emperor of the Eternal Emperor, was worth 2,500 meters. The money could buy 8 plump pigs, 4 strong bulls, 12 fat sheep and 24 tons of wheat, 2 cans of beer, 600 liters of cheese, butter, silver, cloth, and a set of beds.It is similar to the phenomenon that one-bit coins, which used to cost only about 200,000 won three or four years ago, are now valued at more than 10 million won. It is also similar that many of them have begun investing in Korea. The tulip bubble begins to go off in February, 1637. Prices plunged as no tulip buyers appeared. Dutch courts ruled in the face of the tulip's inability to recognize property value, adding fuel to the plunge in prices. Tulip investors found less than 10 percent of their losses. Unlike tulips, Americans and Swiss allow commodities trading and supporters of the beatcoiner want to compare the bit coins to the gold, but many compare them to tulips. ⓒ Unlike tulips, which are not valued for assets if there is a difference to the Pixabay virtual currency. Swiss has allowed virtual currency transactions, and in the United States, Bitcone is trading at the Chicago Board of Trade (CME) and Chicago Options Exchange (CBOE). China and Russia, however, prohibit virtual currency transactions entirely. By definition, a ban on virtual currency is in countries with relatively strong government involvement in the market. As time goes by, consumers are running out of money, not like tulips. It is the point where the pessimists who talk about the tulip bubble need further explanation. Another history arising from the virtual currency controversy is the gold standard. Optimizer say that when it comes to the future of virtual money, it will be an exchange bill that will replace ' gold ' or ' dollar. ' The gold standard system is the use of ' gold ' as a currency. In addition to its unwavering value, more reliable than previous currencies, the Gold Standard has adopted this system since the history of the Lydia Empire and the East Roman Empire. The long-sustained gold standard system was damaged by the currency of each country during World War I, and it was actually dismantled by the Great Depression of 1929. Gold has been used as a ' currency ' for a long time since the Middle Ages because its value has not changed. Crops and animals and plants decay or are depreciated over time, but the value of the crops does not change. It was not that much of a drop in prices was caused by seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand, such as crops. The same is true of virtual money. Because of the data stored on computers and mobile, the intrinsic value of it doesn't go to waste over time. Just as gold is a limiting resource, so is virtual money. Only 21 million virtual coins can be extracted, and other types of virtual currency have limitations on the amount of cash collected. This means that the economy can at least stop the excessive production. In addition, virtual currency is more complementary than gold. In the virtual world, it is hard for thieves to steal money by hacking or hacking away the gold cart from 20 to 30 bandits. Virtual money is based on the ' block chain ' technology, a distributed data storage technology. In conclusion, this technique is very strong for hacking. If you want to hack into existing bank accounts, you need only hit a computer. Virtual money with block chain technologies is a form of storing one coin by dividing it into several computers. The number of computers that need to be hacked to withdraw virtual money increases to a few hundred. So far, it only takes one lock to open the safe, and virtual currency requires several doors. Unlike gold, virtual currency is not controlled by the government directly, unlike the gold standard : "" Will the government see? "" Under the gold standard, the government adjusted the supply and demand of the money to ensure stable currency. The government has also balanced the balance of trade and finance. Virtual money is not directly controlled by the government in its supply and demand. No wonder, the government does not even consider virtual currencies when setting its balance of trade and finance. Since virtual currency is ' no national boundaries ', it is virtually impossible for a government of a certain country to keep in control in the future. The difference is that although gold transactions are visible, virtual currency transactions can not. Most virtual currency transactions are guaranteed anonymity. There are also virtual currency that has been blocked from knowing who sent the money and who received the money. This also opens up the possibility of the flow into black money. Some virtual currency is already being used as the main currency of drug dealers. If virtual money is involved in a black money scandal, the possibility of additional government regulations can not be ruled out. Here, you can ask some additional questions to the optimist. How much power can the government provide for a currency they can't control?Copyright Copywriter (c) Omai News (Citizen Reporters), Unauthorized Child and Redistribution geumji ☞ ne majimak se [ gingeup ] wol ho seutori kaempein gajok mit nyuseu ... ...

"▽ Commissions of Pyeongchang's Yonhap News Agency (Yonhap news agency, October 13) reported on the possibility of notifying three members of the delegation to "" Orchestra "" to select the most talented artist in the snow and organize an art troupe. It is very possible that the members of the arts corps to which the members of the list are affiliated will visit the South. Since working-level contacts themselves are carried out by the South to select and accept requests from the North Korean artists ' delegation to perform in the South, it is highly likely that they will come from the South. North Korea has appointed Kwon Hyuk-bong, director of the Cultural and Performing Arts Administration, as head of the working-level contacts, and proposed Yoon Beom-ju, conductor of the Orchestra, Hyun Song-wol, and Chief Executive Officer of the Orchestra. Most notably, the head of the Korean delegation, Hyun Song-wol, Moranbong, was included on the list. Former singer Hyun Song-wol, 30, is on the fast track in North Korea as he became a candidate for the party central committee in October last year at the 7th general meeting of the Workers ` Party Central Committee. Some say he is the former lover of Kim Jong Un. As Hyun Song-wol put his name on the North's business contact list, observers say Moranbong, the band is coming to Pyeongchang in some form. The Moranbong band, led by Hyun Song-wol, is called the North Korean girl group because it is made up of female performers and singers who boast the highest skills and looks. The Moranbong band, reportedly named for themselves by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, first received attention in July 2012 when it first debuted in the U.S. on the stage of its founding with the theme of the American film Rocky. [Yonhap news agency photo] shows North Korea's Moranbong Band performing in 2016. However, it is unclear whether Hyun Song-wol will be able to appear in Pyeongchang as the head of the orchestra. "" Although Hyeonsong-wol was known as the head of the Moranbong Band, the message can't confirm that the ' Hyun Song-wol Orchestra General ' meant anything else, "" a ministry official said. As such, the identity of the North's orchestra is currently vague. Unlike the Moranbong bands with electronic bands on the North Korean stage, the orchestral concert's main band was the "" Galaxy Orchestra. "" However, the Milky Way Orchestra disappeared from the North Korean media after October 2013. Meanwhile, it was rumored that 10 members of the unit were shot for involvement with Jang, and Nam Jae-jun, head of the National Intelligence Service (NIS), confirmed the rumor to the National Assembly's Intelligence Committee. As a result, it is also possible that the orchestra that the North has recorded is the successor of the Milky Way Orchestra. In particular, Yoon Beom-ju, who was named the "" Orchestra Commander "" of the North's working-level contact delegation, was introduced as the "" Galaxy Orchestra conductor "" on May 10, 2013 at a news report by the Korean Central News Agency. He was then honored with the title of a popular artist. The 2012 performances by the Milky Way Orchestra, but given that the ' Orchestra ' is not unique, it could have been a temporary designation given by North Korea before the negotiations begin. North Korea is set to host the National Unification Congress in Seoul in 2002 when the relationship between the two Koreas was good, featuring about 30 singers and dancers from the Mansudae Art Club, Pibada Opera Company and Pyongyang Arts Club.

Rather than hold back the transaction itself, we're going to get rid of the speculative bubble and stop it from being misused as a means to commit crimes like tax evasion. The tax base that the government is reviewing depends on whether the virtual currency is considered an asset such as the foreign exchange or a kind of program, a commodity. If you look at assets, you can get transfer income tax, but in the United States, you can get a maximum tax of 38 percent and in Japan, you can get a 45 percent tax.If defined as a product, you can add a VAT, which is Singaporean.We're also looking at imposing a transaction tax on it, like the stock market.However, it does not seem easy to set a standard by which to tax the transactions and the income they generate.

"Seoul [Donga-bo] - 15 degrees Celsius (Seoul) has shrunk due to the cold spell and heavy snow that hit the peninsula. The owner of a plastic wagon, "" Water Vapor Ice, "" is brushing off the ice inside a plastic membrane in Gwangjing-gu, Seoul (photo on the left.) A cafe in Dongjak-gu, Seoul, has frozen up on its water supply and sold water. A wagon in the Seoul's Gwangjin district was turned into a "" winter kingdom "" around 1 a.m. on July 12. In the hot soup I froze the steam straight inside the vinyl film. There were several ' steam icicles ' forming on the ceiling. The wrinkled plastic membrane didn't even freeze up. The host kept shaking the ice, but he was curious. I have been doing this for 20 years, but I have never seen anything like it, Ahn said. The temperature in Seoul is - 13.7 degrees. In addition, winds of 3 meters per second caused temperature to drop sharply to minus 20.0 degrees Celsius. It was the coldest day of the last 11 or 12 days when the cold wave hit.○ Cold wave hitting the Korean Peninsula over time has dragged down the mercury. It continued to go down after 0:36 a.m. on July 12, and recorded - 15.3 a.m. after 7 a.m. It was the lowest temperature on that day. Visitors could not easily tour the Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market in Dongjak-gu, Seoul on that day. I could only see traders sitting close to the fire, melting down. The water from the tank froze solid and the floor turned into ice. A merchant, Kim (62, female), said, It was so cold that I didn`t have any customers for more than 12 hours. I have never seen such a enemy in 10 years of business here. MultI-house apartments, less cold-proof than apartments, were busy from early morning. Chung (24, female, and Seongbuk-gu), Seoul, went to an outdoor boiler room with a hair dryer as soon as he woke up. It is to melt the frozen hot water pipes. Heavily armed with padding jumpers and woolen gloves, Chung struggled for two hours in a water pipe before being able to wash it with hot water. We covered it up well in insulation materials but we were frozen and panicked, Chung said. Even if they were absent from work for a day, the hard-to-life people pushed their knives into the streets. Na (74), a basic life security provider, left the basement single room in Gangbuk-gu, Seoul on July 12. He drove the car to the station near Suyu Station on subway line 4. If you pick up a scrap paper, plastic, and press it into a cart, you are bound by 10,000 won a day. "" Sometimes I really appreciate a cup of coffee from shop owners, "" Na laughed. When the cold wave comes on, the policeman gets busy. Crime is on the decline, but there is a high possibility that the homeless and the hangovers will die. Around 11:00 p.m. on July 11, police chief Kim Jong-yoon (36), a police officer at Yeongdeungpo Station in Seoul, began patrolling night with two of his colleagues. He spent about an hour patrolling Yeongdeungpo Station and nearby paebang villages. The breath on the mask and hat froze quickly. The homeless shelter, which usually had quite a few empty seats, was packed. Homeless people who could not drink alcohol also entered shelters early and settled down. However, some of the elderly living in the village village failed to attend the free meal ceremony on July 12, as if they could not dare to do so. Instead, they could drink soju in a small room.○ The temperature in Anheung-myeon, Hoengseong-gun, Gangwon Province, dropped to minus 24.8 degrees on the morning of July 12. In Chuncheon, where the temperature was minus 18 degrees, reports of Dongpa, a water meter, were filed one after another. Fire engines started to pour water in Mureung-ri, Yeongwol-gun and Goyang-ri, Jeongseon-gun, after freezing them to a well. Damage continued in the Honam region, which was hit by heavy snow and cold weather. A 92 year-old dementia patient was found dead on the road in front of a town in Gochang-gun, North Jeolla Province at around 6 a.m. yesterday. Police believe that Choi died of hypothermia after leaving home on July 11. Other accidents included the collapse of house facilities, congratulatory speeches, compost factories, and a membrane for growing ginseng. The Jeju sky and sea route were blocked by continued snow and strong winds on July 12. At Jeju International Airport, where the runways were broken and resumed repeatedly, takeoff and landing was normalized this day. Asiana OZ8901, which departed from Gimpo Airport in Seoul, landed at Jeju Airport safely at 6:59 a.m. The plane T-Way Airlines Flight TW722, carrying 168 passengers, departed from Jeju Island. The Korea Airports Corporation Jeju headquarters announced on July 12, "" We have shipped around 7,000 people daily.

Does this make any sense?If we allow the payment of the card in Lotto, we get sales revenue exactly, said C, emphasizing that it is still unreasonable to see cash when everything is becoming clear."" The lottery itself is a kind of gambling industry, "" D said. Does it make any sense to ban people from buying a card to stop gambling? Do not waste money on false hopes or false hopes."" Don't buy Lotto. It is rather better to buy tasty food with that money. ''Lotto is the most frequently visited lottery ticket by Koreans.You can judge the popularity of Lotto by its actual size.According to the Strategy and Finance Ministry's "" The 2016 National Lottery Fund, "" the total sales revenues of lottery tickets in Korea are 3.8404 trillion won in 2016. Among them, online lottery ticket sales amounted to 3.5221 trillion won, or 92 percent of total sales.The online lottery is Lotto. Online lotteries are distinct from Internet ones by allowing purchases to be transmitted to a central computer in real time and later determining if they win.Although annual sales revenues reach 4 trillion won, they can be purchased only in cash.It is illegal for vendors to sell lottery tickets by credit card. Article 5, 4 of the lottery and lottery fund law, states that you should not sell lottery tickets by credit card.From the point of view of merchants, there is no reason to make an irregularity while paying a fee.It is because of lottery gambling that illegally nailed payment by check card instead of credit card. When paying by credit card, it is likely that the buyer will go on credit.That is why one can not buy Lotto for more than a certain amount is considered to be a lottery ticket. In law, is sold over the amount set by the Presidential decree, the seller should not to. The enforcement ordinance sets the price at 100,000 won.However, Lotto card payment will be allowed on a limited basis starting from the end of this year. However, it is a good idea to purchase Lotto by Internet.The government will release Internet Lotto starting December 2 of this year. The law allowing payment of credit cards illegally allows exceptions when it is difficult to purchase them directly with cash, thus allowing credit card payment from then on.If the payment is allowed from the end of the year, the purchase limit per person will most likely be set at 5,000 won. Internet sales to total sales are limited to 5 percent. This is to prevent excessive gambling.It is expected that the voice asking for permission to pay by credit card will increase in the near future.Unlike credit cards, check cards do not have a credit rating. For buyers, the payment method is more akin to cash.Under the circumstances that are not distinct from cash, the argument that at least the check card should be allowed is likely to gain momentum.Photographers.Kim Hyunju-Hoo Correspondent stillcut@segye.com ⓒ nun neun ilbo ,, Global Media Daily"
"Police Chief Lee Cheol-seong visited the National Police Agency's human rights center in Garwol-dong, Yongsan-gu, Seoul on July 13 to pay tribute to the late martyr Park Jong-cheol and pay tribute to the human rights center in July 7, 2001. News reporter Kim Myung-Sup 1 1 © news and 2018.1.13 bakjjongcheol for 31st anniversary of Burning Quicksand visit Namyeong-dong ""the bereaved family and civic groups, discuss specific plans to meet you."" (= 1 News, Seoul, Korea) bakttonghae the press.= icheolseong, police chief (late) bakjjongcheol units were killed during torture, a place in which old Namyeong-dong, participating citizens are to operate the air loss (The Human Rights Center).Considering, said.Lee made the remarks after visiting the police headquarters and the National Police Agency's human rights center at 11:00 a.m. on July 13, one day before the ceremony to commemorate Park's 31th anniversary.After paying a silent tribute to the flowers at the human rights center, Lee visited the memorial hall for the martyr Park Jong-cheol on the fourth floor.Lee, who had shut up his mouth and had a solemn expression on his visit, responded to the question with a question of the purpose of his visit, saying, "" With the recent film ' 1987, ' many people looked back on the painful history of the struggle in June. ""Lee then said, "" We consulted with civic groups on the laws that the law permits when it comes to operating the building, and said, "" If the memorial service meets their wishes, it will be used wisely. ""Civic groups including Park Jong-cheol of the United Nations ' Association for Democracy and Family Affairs earlier pointed out that it was inappropriate for the police who killed Park to continue to manage the loss of the national throne in Namyeong-dong under the name of human rights center. They should also expand their facility to commemorate the democratization movement in the building and set up a torture recovery center under the supervision of civic groups to honor victims of past national violence and to serve as symbols of the human rights issue.Meanwhile, Park, who was a student representative at the Seoul National University's Language Studies Association, was taken to the police department responsible for the loss of the security headquarters at his boarding house in early January 1987 and died on the same day at 11:20 a.m. from electric and water torture. Police initially claimed the death was caused by a chronic disease, but an autopsy revealed Park suffocated due to a neck being crushed on the chin of a bathtub.Report to the journalist Jeong Eun-ji : A Korean woman was reported killed near a tourist attraction in Bolivia. The bodies of Korean women in their 40s were confirmed to have been found on a solar island near Lake Titicaca in Bolivia, Foreign Ministry officials said on Tuesday.Police in Bolivia carried out an autopsy on the Korean people in La Paz. The authorities added that the cause of death so far is believed to have been due to a stab wound.The embassy in charge of the embassy received a related notice from the local police and sent an embassy worker to the scene of an autopsy. It also provides guidance and support for the families of the dead.We have requested the Bolivia police authorities to thoroughly investigate the deaths of our people and seek an immediate arrest of the criminals, a Foreign Ministry official said.A young man looks closely at the bulletin board in front of the Virtual Monetary Exchange in Seoul yesterday. The price of the virtual currency has been on the roller coaster ride for many days, with the price of Bitcone bouncing back to the level of 19 million won, down to 14.1 million won from the closing of the exchange the day before. Yoon Seong-ho, a reporter and committee of the Justice Ministry and the Financial Services Commission, said, "" The ministry will strongly support the use of the password while issuing a cautious approach, "" adding, "" The government will provide financial support. Although it stepped back from its stance of shutting down the Korea Exchange, it has failed to come up with a suitable follow-up measures. It will take time for the government to come up with comprehensive measures. The government held a closed-door vice ministerial meeting of related ministries yesterday to discuss how to deal with virtual currencies under the leadership of Hong Nam-gi, the head of the Office for Government Policy Coordination. This is to iron out differences between the ministries regarding the nature of virtual currency. The related ministries reported whether to view virtual money as a commodity, floating assets, and simple investment, the core technology of the fourth industrial revolution, the block chain. The ministry and financial authorities are negative about the issue. The government should impose strict sanctions against the companies because they are highly speculative but do not have any regulations at all. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Science, Technology, Information and Communication, along with other ministries in charge of scientific technology and start-ups, called for a cautious approach to block chains. Cheong Wa Dae is also in a quandary. If a storm breaks out after preparing a countermeasure as a rule, it will lose credibility in the policy. A presidential official said, In short, we can say that there are nearly 3 million people in Gangwon Land today, but we will implement a virtual account system to confirm the real name of the virtual currency that is scheduled to be introduced on July 20 and then implement the market measures. We are trying to make a soft landing, taking into consideration the impact the market is experiencing, he added. The government is determined to provide support for the use of related technologies in the development of innovation, while strongly responding to the overheated speculation. Minister of Finance and Economy Kim Dong-yeon told reporters at the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts that the government needs to respond to the overheated virtual currency market and all sides need to have some kind of regulation. But Deputy Prime Minister Kim said yesterday, The Justice Minister is the Justice Ministry's proposal to discuss the exchange closure. It is a matter for consultation between ministries, "" he said. Financial authorities have tightened inspections on banks that issued virtual accounts to the Korea Virtual Monetary Exchange to curb speculation."
"The secret to the successful management cost diet was trust the managers and residents of the three corporations during the management service hours and voluntarily participate in the race by saving residents ' management expenses by participating in Donga~Eco Ecoville, Individual Heating & Safety Commission, and LED broadcasting systems by using 20 thousand won or more Although households account for a large proportion of their household finances to the tens of thousands of won a month, few people are deeply concerned about administrative costs. It contains the absolute belief that the management office and the residents ' representatives ' meeting should have been arranged with a few compassion. Furthermore, as more and more people are automatically forced to exit credit cards or bank accounts, management costs are considered to be "" steady money. "" If you look at the bill for maintenance or the information on charges, you can easily throw it in because it is full of words and numbers you don't even know.If they suddenly felt like they were being paid more, they would either end up saying, "" Because prices went up, the bills would go up, "" or, "" I used a lot of electricity, "" and "" Who else would have spent a lot of water with me? "" Meanwhile, next month's administrative expense bill will come in without fail.In fact, the nation's average apartment management costs are rising. The Korean daily newspaper analyzed five major areas (1,474 % of the total cost of apartment management), including general management cost, emergency expenses, cleaning expenses, electric bills, and water bills, as of 2016 (92 %) based on unit price. According to the Bank of Korea and the National Statistical Office, the price index on apartment management in the first half of last year rose 24.3 percent from 87.40 percent in the second quarter of 2012, which is the same period.Apartment management expenses status In this era of rising costs of apartment management, there are apartments that pay less than others. Dong-A Ilbo learned the secret of the three elite apartments that succeeded in "" maintenance cost dieting. "" From 2012 to 2016, when apartments were compared with the national administrative costs using the apartment management system (k - apt), the department successfully reduced the cost of apartments in Geoyeo-1, Dongah Ecoville, and Seokgwan by 0.7 to 14.7 %. When it comes to electricity and water bills, the number of electricity fees for the first part of the town dropped 37.9 percent, that of the Jong-ah Ecoville, and that of the Seokgwan Doosan Group were reduced by 2.25 percent.Sudden number of apartments that have succeeded in diet. It may not seem great, but the apartments that were once filled with conflicts between residents made small but successful changes. All residents also tried to manage them gradually. These complexes did not fire security and cleaning staff during the hike in minimum wage. Instead, they saved electricity, water, and waste disposal costs. The mini-solar generator is installed, and the underground parking lot lighting and generation lighting are replaced with organic light emitting diodes (LED). We converted the electricity supply contract with KEPCO into a single contract, not a comprehensive contract. The two places have moved from central heating to individual heating. They worked hard to reduce energy costs, which account for 70 percent of apartment management costs. However, it is not just the facilities and the hardware changes. The three apartments were once involved in lawsuits against each other over management costs and various construction costs. As a result, the public's distrust toward the residents ' representatives and managers grew. However, after the appearance of hard-working residents and managers, apartment operations became more transparent and restored trust among residents. As a result, the conflict disappeared as if in the spring, and residents flocked to have a flurry of ideas to reduce costs. In other words, invisible power of faith lowered administrative costs.The "" trust gained from individual heating "" won the grand prize at an energy-saving contest hosted by Seoul Metropolitan Government in December 2003. The amount of electricity saved by Seoul apartments (from February to August) was voted the most energy-saving apartment in the past year (around 8.5 billion kWh) : reduced by about 35.129 million won to 275.2 million last year. This means that the electricity bill has been reduced by nearly 100 million won.Donga Echoville won the grand prize at the ' Energy Conservation Competition ' hosted by Seoul City last year. Being selected as the most energy-saving apartment among the apartments in Seoul. It reduced electricity bills by nearly 100 million won over the past seven months. "" The lighting in the basement parking lots provided by Donga Echoville was turned into LEDs and the electricity bill was saved by the establishment of mini-solar facilities for the first generation. "" Considering the portion of electricity used by the public sector (25 percent) in apartments, reducing administrative costs is unavoidable unless residents agree on individual facilities.Ahn Deok-jun, the 56-year-old resident representative, said, If I ask people to do something at an administrative office or a representative meeting of residents, I can not wear sunglasses.The residents of Donga Echoville started to trust the residents ' council and support existing central heating system by switching to individual heating in 2015. At that time, all candidates who ran for the representative election of residents pledged to turn over individual heating. In older apartments the central heating system is too old to pass on heat energy efficiently to each generation. Another problem is that some people are warm and others are less warm when heated equally. "" It is a common view among apartment officials that central heating uses more gas and therefore costs more money to manage, "" said Seo Sung-hak, manager of the department. As with many apartments, Dong-Aikoville tried to move from central heating to individual heating, but failed twice. However, the third attempt in 2015 was different. Seo took out a pin board and posted a board to the management office that shows the status of individual transfers whenever they received. Although they provided the "" Dong-A Ecoville, "" few expected individual heating to become reality. As for other apartments, larger balanced residents preferred central heating, while small-size balanced residents had different opinions on individual heating, Ahn explained. According to the Act on the Ownership and Management of MultI-building Buildings, to change the heating system, the consent of more than 80 % of owners must be obtained. It is also physically difficult to get votes because four out of five home owners who are not residents agree. Dong-Aikoville also tried to change the heating system twice in 2004 and 2008, but failed. However, it could not be delayed. Seo realized the power of individual heating by watching some residents move to nearby apartments, which are located farther from the subway station than Dong-ah, but have been converted to individual heating after the rent ended. "" It's cheaper to manage than we are. Real estate properties also frequently say that people moving from other regions looked for individual heating apartments rather than central heating. First, the government has made an effort to keep track of the current status of home owners. After getting a certified copy of the register, he began to obtain contact information. Tenants in favor of individual heating were asked to obtain contact information for the landlord via real estate. Residents, however, showed lukewarm reactions. Some were skeptical that the new residents ' representatives and the manager would do well. However, when it was selected as the "" Best Management Park "" by the Seoul Metropolitan Government in December of the same year, it changed its gaze slightly. And winter came. Agreement was circulated in March 2015, shortly after residents complained about heating at its peak. The letter was sent to owners of Korean and overseas homes with address and contact information that they had obtained so far. Seo took out the "" consent pin board "", the trump card. And every time I had a permit in front of the management office that was in favor of individual heating, I would mark it so I could see the residents and the employees at the management office, and I would encourage them to work really hard. Later, women's union members, dongers, and even nearby real estate agents convinced the neighbors to sign on. And within a month, we had 80 percent. The pin board played a crucial role : "" The final score was 1,041 out of a total of 1,253 households, and vice versa. The approval rating of 83.08 percent. Seo immediately handed in a permit to the district office to change the heating system and obtained a permit from the district office on April 9. He also accelerated the selection of design and construction companies and finished individual heating before winter came.Sudden number of apartments that have succeeded in diet. It may not seem great, but the apartments that were once filled with conflicts between residents made small but successful changes. All residents also tried to manage them gradually. The effects of providing APcoville in Seongbuk-dong, capturing SBS television footage, and journalist Park Sang-jun's buttonpr@hankookilbo.com were immediate. Ahn could not keep his mouth open when he saw management costs decreased by more than 200,000 won over three generations from the previous year. When it is central heating, I live with my daughter alone and my wife and I paid up to 540,000 won in winter care expenses even though we were abroad. But even though I moved to individual heating and had an increase in my family, my heating bill was about 150,000 won less. When most residents said, "" Are you serious? "" And they said, "" After individual heating and heating changes, in 2014, the total apartment price of gas for heating and cooking dropped by about 600 million won per year was about 1.6 billion won. Especially in January and February, when you heat the most, you saw a reduction of 100 million to 200 million won per month."
"It is an explanation for the management office. Seo said, "" I was proud of my seniors who were strongly opposed to the idea of changing the heating system. "" Real estate is estimated to have raised housing prices by about 100 million won to 26 pyeong before individual heating projects were completed. Former residents who had moved in just before the construction complained ' Why didn't you tell them in advance? ' Or, in some cases, the council members say, ' We're not going to be able to move back in and do it any more. ' Last summer, 13 state-of-the-art food waste reducing machines (25 million won per unit) were installed in the apartment with support from Seongbuk-gu Office. Prior to the losing time, it paid about 3.6 million won for food processing last August, down to about half in September, or about 1.8 million won and two million won in October. Seo and Ahn said, "" I've been busy going to district offices since the end of last year and I've been trying to write my own copy of the contract with security guards nationwide. Doosan Apartment (moved in in in in in in in in 1998 and 1998) is famous for its energy-saving apartments due to live broadcast and discussion by representatives. At the 2012 Seoul Apartment Community Awards, he received the Best Apartment Award for Conservation, the Korea Green Climate Awards at the 2015 Climate Forum, and the Seoul Foundation's 2006 Winter World Energy Saving Competition.Even Seokgwan Doosan Bears had a long dark season. In 2009, he had a hard time due to conflicts among residents while switching to individual heating. Residents of the meeting who were unhappy with the relocation plan, including the large balanced residents, strongly protested the decision, and the representative meeting and the management office went ahead with the necessary number of agreements. The meeting was set to be held by new heads of the ministries in the same year, but several residents who opposed individual heating have withdrawn their representatives, leaving the meeting on the verge of collapse.Figure 5 The Seokgwan Doosan Bears have impressive energy saving reports. At the 2012 Seoul Apartment Community Awards, he received the Best Apartment Award for Conservation, the Korea Green Climate Awards at the 2015 Climate Forum, and the Seoul Foundation's 2006 Winter World Energy Saving Competition. Energy savings pin board built next to an apartment management office. Shim Jae-cheol (48), who became the new resident representative at the time of Doosan's offer, decided that he could not do anything about it without shifting the minds of residents who oppose the meeting. And tried to have a "" discussion to end "" with a live broadcast of a representative meeting to show that he works for all residents without self-interest.First of all, the residents of the apartment complex are allowed to watch the representative meeting of residents in real time via cable channel (No.99), a circuit to close down the children's playground. The meeting delayed the end of the day and announced the agendas and the opening of the conference to enable more residents to observe. Lee Kyung-ok (63), a resident, said, As the meetings were revealed on TV, more and more residents took part in face-to-face meetings to discuss major issues such as hiring guards after the minimum wage increase. As the eyes grew larger, the delegates naturally studied more and the meetings were fruitful. In addition, Chairman Shim did not set a deadline for the meeting, and went live until midnight when the most important issues were problems. "" We tried to let the residents who were not going to trust the representative meeting know that at least we don't have a choice. People who were against it over time said, "" I won't play games with you. "" She made sure that when the management office was working on the project, the director would only leave a basis behind, and that when the directors were working, she would only e-mail the information about directors. Shim, who works for a company, answered as many as possible local questions and opinions on his apartment's home page after work and immediately took steps through the management office if they could solve any problems right away. "" I felt a lot of frustration when I read it. But when I tried to be as truthful as possible and say I would be done by tomorrow morning, I felt more confident that I would keep it, "" said Seokgwan Doosan Apartment, which can reduce energy consumption and actively save three plus one. Residents study and make their own plans for doing things, and then go from door to door to explain how to save energy. Shim Jae-cheol, former head of the resident's delegation, explains energy conservation to residents. Many apartments were also offered with the Seokgwan Doosan Group to help make the selection process more transparent. The selection committee, which includes mothers and their children's votes, has decided to give a public presentation to determine who will run the nursery in the complex, which had previously been dominated by the council. Chairman Shim and other members of the delegation spent nearly a year operating in a transparent and fair manner, which resulted in trust from the residents and reduced conflicts. And they started to upgrade their facilities. The start was to change the lighting in the underground parking lot to LED lights. She, who has always been interested in saving energy, decided that switching to LED's would save a lot of electricity. "" Just in time, one company offered to pay for the replacement of 500 million won in construction costs and then take some of the saved utilities electricity. It seemed like things were going to be easy, but all of a sudden, they offered me 50 million won extra. With the big money offered, he must have inflated construction costs. The council immediately revealed this and cancelled the contract. "" The Seokgwan Doosan Apartment is famous for its energy-saving apartments with residents. Back in 2012, residents saved 130 million won that year by switching from sensor-equipped underground parking lot lights to sensor-equipped LEDs and converting their electricity payment contracts with Korean electricity to a single contract. Seokgwan, the head of Doosan Sudae, studied LED's to find out directly what the appropriate construction cost was. Then, he began bidding again a year later, and then assigned construction to the company that offered about 130 million won. Construction expenses were set up with the money saved for apartment profit projects in January 2012. In particular, it from the captains ' meeting to after lights are off people or illuminates while the car is approaching, sensors are operating diming (deeming) zone to adoption by the system.Get ideas.The company changed its contract from comprehensive contracts with Korea Electric Power Corp. to a single contract in March of the same year. The comprehensive contract adds up the electricity used by individual households after applying the residential electric low voltage electric bill and the general high voltage electric power bill. For a single contract, the average usage of total capacity (residents + public sector) divided by the number of households is calculated and then the rates per section are applied. However, the fare per section is cheaper than the previous one. Although there is no obvious benefit to any contract, Shim explained that when the common electricity used in public facilities exceeds about 30 percent of total usage, a single contract was more advantageous and changed the contract.After two changes, residents of Seokgwan Doosan Apartment in August of that year were shocked to receive an administrative fee notice. The "" electricity discount of 15,980 won "" was stamped on. South Koreans got their electricity back in the middle of the summer, when they worried about the price of an electric bomb. Seokgwan Doosan saved 130 million won in electricity bills compared to last year during 2012, and residents were given benefits from administrative costs. "" With an average monthly administrative cost cut of 7,000 won, the atmosphere among residents is ' You can trust the representative council ', "" Doosan Group was selected as the most frugal apartment by the city government that year. The elevator lights and street lights were then turned into LED and a new booster pump was adopted to improve the water supply system. This method does not use rooftop water tanks, so it maintains clean water quality at all times and reduces electricity bills. Although the installation cost is twice as high as the existing pumps, residents respected the decision of the representative meeting.Seokgwan Doosan Apartment is holding various events with its residents to help save energy in the life. Parents and children who take part in a star-watching program are examining an astronomical telescope. The reliability of the residents who were threatened with the provision of Seokgwan Doosan Group was the driving force behind the active participation of residents in the energy independence village project in Seoul since 2014. In particular, the 3+1 energy saving movement, which allows apartment residents to practice energy saving in their own lives, has become a symbol of the Seokgwan Doosan Group, and is an important example that the Seoul Metropolitan Government is introducing. In addition, the company made headlines by spending part of its savings to guarantee the employment of 30 security guards and raise wages by 19 percent.As the village was changed to match, the administrative expenses of Song Gwang-ok (42), who lives in the first Danji (moved in and moved in to Seoul in 1997), went down to meet his mother. As a member of the Geoyeopoormie Community Service Center in the apartment building, he holds small and big events in the town and reads books to children as a lecturer in the Donghoe Theater. He also works as an honorary reporter for Songpa-gu Office to spread the news. Late last year, he represented apartments at the Community Revitalization Superforment Park Presentation, organized by the Seoul Metropolitan Government. "" I have a busier job, but I'm not the only one. There are so many events for residents in my apartment. Many of us give lectures with gifts and hold events. Of course, everybody likes it. "" Song laughed, saying, Even in her day out of care and housework, she enjoys volunteering for an apartment that fits.The first complex received the best energy saving contest in the summer of 2016 and in the following winter. It was selected as an outstanding park for promoting eco - friendly technology and low-carbon life by receiving an Environment Minister award in 2017. Management expenses have been greatly reduced. Area in 2016"
"Electricity and water rates have decreased by approximately 38 percent compared to 2012. The first part of the year was provided with a "" Christmas party to preview with PurmI classroom, "" inviting kindergarten and elementary school students to the apartment on July 22. In October, I went on a free trip to visit a folk village and experience energy for senior citizens over the age of 65. There was also a Halloween festival for children. There are quite a few community engagement programs, given that they are not a large community park with 1,004 residents. At the same time, a health building contest was held at Geoyeo-1 Park last summer. As the people wanted to use the stairs instead of elevators, the residents made sure to make their own phrases to get into the stairs. The residents voted themselves, and they said, miracle is, slow! Let's walk!Let's not lose our value to familiarity. The winner of the ceremony was Wang Saeng-wha, who created the words and gave MultI-level as prizes. People who participated in the event were drawn to win prizes. By East, residents were asked to keep a record of their performance on every step, rather than an elevator, and awarded the bronze medal for its most frequently used stairs.Songpa Maoyeos, the corridor and the staircase of the first section have a phrase that stands out. More and more people are using the stairs instead of elevators and creating "" fitness stairs "" that are engraved with phrases that residents themselves have built. As people participate together and planning various programs, it is becoming a "" fitting town. "" Park Sang-jun, a reporter at Geoseon.com, was chosen as the Seoul Metropolitan Government's "" Energy Independence Village "" in 2016, when Geoyeong 1, a town that was crowded like this, became such a tough neighborhood. Previously, residents had endless lawsuits and arguments, and of course, there were few events that would have been entirely shared by residents. Things started to change when Choi Jae-young (38), a young and energetic resident, was elected as the representative of the local community. Choi's energy independence movement can expect to protect the environment and reduce management costs, but it was not easy to draw attention from residents. Residents remained aloof from each other, saying, Let's save energy later, when everyone is busy.Choi said, "" I have many young parents who raise their children in apartments, so I made a field trip program to Gwacheon National Science Museum and other cities. As the Seoul Energy Independence Village was supported by the government, parents began to pay more and more attention to the tours with energy education. As there were few outside events to pay for in apartments, about 10 senior citizens participated. As the attention of the residents was focused, Choi began running various education programs to teach students how to create LED's, PV installations and apartment energy demand management checks. At the same time, the remaining space used as a junkyard warehouse was decorated with ' energy storage ' and returned to the residents.In the apartment building in Seoul, the first part of the town has six roofs with solar PV systems. The solar generator produces 50 % of the public electricity. Bang Gye-ok, manager of the management team, explains about the solar generator on the rooftop. Park Sang-jun, a reporter at Georyeong.com, has begun to transform Geo-yeon-1. In those days, large solar generators were installed on every rooftop of 6 buildings, and mini-house solar generators and LED replacement were performed at each house. More than 9 out of 10 households have joined the Seoul City Eco-Miles.The first complex received the best energy saving contest in the summer of 2016 and in the following winter. It was selected as an outstanding park for promoting eco - friendly technology and low-carbon life by receiving an Environment Minister award in 2017. Management expenses have been greatly reduced. Electricity and water rates per square meter in 2016 were cut by approximately 38 percent compared to 2012.Apartment management costs are not an individual issue for residents and should be solved all together, said Im Sang-ho, a counselor at the Central Housing Management Center.

The ranking was second according to the number of recommendations.The deadline for the petition is Dec. 27, when the presidential office is expected to meet its official criteria of recommending more than 200,000 people a month.Cheong Wa Dae requires responsible officials to reply to a petition that meets the criteria within a month.The interceded, "" Many people have been hurt with cipher money, and an individual is responsible for an investment success or failure.

""" The M.O. is brutal and serious, "" (Suwon = Yonhap news agency) reporter Ryu Soo-hyeon : 35, who was extradited to New Zealand 80 days after the murder of his family and escape, will be released to Korea.Hong Ki-won, a reporter for Yong-in's family murder (Yong-in = Yonhap News Agency), murdered the family of his confessed mother and escaped to New Zealand in the afternoon before an arrest warrant was issued. Police requested an arrest warrant for Kim Thursday on charges of killing a robber. If the southern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency held an individual disclosure decision committee led by criminal chief Na Won-oh on July 12 and asked for a warrant to question the suspect before he was detained, it would say. Cho Young-eun, a judge of the Suwon District Court, issued an arrest warrant for Kim on July 13 at 6 p.m. on charges of robbery and murder. We are concerned about the destruction of evidence and the departure process, Cho said, explaining why the warrant was issued. Kim Seong-gwan is accused of stabbing a mother (55), a younger brother (14) and a stepfather (57) on October 21 last year. Kim, who took about 120 million won from his mother's account on the day of the crime, escaped to New Zealand on the second day of the crime with his wife, Jung (33) and her two daughters, who were two months old and aged 2 to 7 months, to live. Kim, who was deported on July 11 after 80 days of refuge, claimed in a police investigation that, "" I accidentally committed a crime during an argument, and my wife did not participate in the crime. "" As personal information was revealed when Kim was arrested, the police did not plan to provide the face masks and hats that they usually provided to suspects for future inspections at the scene. Kim, who appeared at the eastern police station in Yongin before going through a physical examination for a warrant, hid his face completely in a mask with a baseball cap and hood. "" We believe the methods are brutal, such as the murder of his biological mother and a younger brother with deadly weapons, and the damage from the crime is significant, "" a police officer said. We will concentrate on questioning Kim`s planned crime and whether or not his wife had colluded with him during further investigations, he added. The current special law on the punishment of a certain violent crime enables the investigating body to request personal information such as the face of a suspect and the name of the person concerned in case of a certain violent crime, such as murder, sex, drug, inducement, robbery, or violence. In order to disclose the identity of suspects, ▲, the means of crime, and the occurrence of serious damages ▲, the evidence that a suspect committed a crime, ▲, the right to know, and the right to know, and the need for crime prevention. Case concerning the disclosure of the suspect's personal information is suspect Kim Hak-bong, murder victim of a mountain climber at Suraksan Mountain in Seoul in 2016, murder suspect Lee Seong-woo, murder suspect of a murder victim in Daebudo, Kyonggi Province, and a daughter of a golf practice house in Changwon, South Gyeongsang Province last year. ▶ you@yna.co.kr 1:1 ▶ Pyeongchang Winter Olympics video competition report and your reporter, this article, ""really good relationship with him."" comments, I'm just really transform attitudes for the last few days.I can not ... to a blurred sound - the 'make mischief of the Alliance is 北' comments to make one wonder ""that, too, if I will try"" when asked - a surprise hearing in May last year.See ""Kim Jong Un will glory when they meet"" later if wombieo And again "" - Kim Jong Un, sanctions of the release negotiations through 10 years, 100 years to put a stop to the hardships won't.There is no larger and stronger ""February, for Kim Jong Un,"" Kim Jong-un and North Korea.

"As the government begins to discuss closing the virtual currency exchange, Shinhan Bank and other commercial banks have indefinitely postponed introducing a real-name verification system for the virtual currency exchange. A citizen walks out of Shinhan Bank in downtown Seoul yesterday. Bank's regulatory policy to introduce a new real-name policy The bank's policy to regulate the banks was unclear. Banks were planning to prohibit the opening of new virtual currency accounts and build a real-name verification system for existing accounts, but they are delaying the introduction of the system due to the government's uncertain regulations. As the government has twisted the arm of banks and credit card companies, who are in charge of payment and payment, leaving the virtual currency exchange at the heart of the problem, confusion is spreading throughout the financial sector. Shinhan Bank announced yesterday that it would indefinitely delay plans to introduce a verification account system for virtual currency transactions. We need to look further at the guidelines of financial authorities, a Shinhan official said on July 12. Shinhan Bank also announced its plan to prohibit the deposit of existing accounts on October 15 when it sent official letters to the three exchanges, including Bittham Cobbitt's. The bank intends to make it more difficult to use existing accounts by allowing withdrawals but stopping deposit. IBK Industrial Bank also announced that it would delay the operation of the real-name bank system. KEB Hana Bank KB Kookmin Bank also hinted at holding on until additional government guidelines were announced. A bank official said on condition of anonymity, The date of the operation of the real-name system is also confusing as there are no government guidelines, meaning it is not possible to know whether it is on the 15th or 22nd. Industry analysts say the government has set a goal of shutting down the domestic exchange and making transactions as inconvenient as possible regarding virtual currency, and is mobilizing banks and card companies. Until a virtual money-related law is established, it is believed to be designed to pressure speculators by strengthening supervision of the payment system and encourage innocent victims to leave early. The Credit Finance Association, an association of eight credit card companies, is set to discuss ways to ban payment of local cards on overseas virtual currency exchanges starting next week. This is because Korean investors who can not find a way to pay due to a ban on issuing new bank accounts are increasingly making direct payments via credit cards from overseas exchanges. We are still limiting the additional transactions if they are confirmed, a credit association official said, confirming the specific method, explaining the request by the authorities regarding the ban. The government's move to make virtual currency more uncomfortable is aimed at making banks and credit card companies take charge, but points out that the regulatory office is wrong. As the bank announced its plan to reduce the account, the Internet responded with a threatening reaction, "" Be ready for the bank. "" Instead of the government, which has been busy with its own moves, the wrong banks have become the target of virtual currency investors. Professor Oh Jeong-keun of Konkuk University said, The government should first readjust the legal nature of virtual currency and turn the required exchanges into a method to make sure they are developed in order to prevent such confusion.

"Samsung Group's first labor union negotiation in 80 years was crippled by the opposition from its management ··· The Korean Federation of Trade Unions, the representative of the Samsung wel Story, did not expect such a situation at all. The first meeting between employers and employees, which was awkward even when it was called the "" Sangkyeon Meeting, "" was a symbolic representation of how hard it was to get organized at Samsung. Samsung is hard to form a union, but that means there are still too many barriers to unions to get around. The confrontation between the two sides is likely to escalate into labor disputes, including the first strike in the group, as labor unions warned of tougher measures on the grounds of insincere attitude toward negotiations.Samsung Story Branch secured 64 members as of October 2017 when it was recognized as a majority union by management. The management requested the union to unify a union agreement with the second labor union of the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, which was established in-house, and failed to unify the two unions, which resulted in the control of the two umbrella unions. As a result, management and the branch of the branch went to the stage to hold a single association, and this was the first labor union meeting in Samsung's 80-year history that received much attention from businesses and labor unions."" I felt uneasy about the postponement of the meeting between the bride and groom families, "" said Samsung wel Story Executive Branch Chairman, "" and I have to ask them to make a decision. The company`s first meeting of the two heads of state, originally scheduled to be held in December last year, was delayed once, on request of the company`s next meeting. The date of the meeting of the bride and groom families was January 10. However, something else suspicious has happened to the union. It is not the company but the external location where the management has informed us that the meeting was held. The building was built in Bundang, Gyeonggi Province, which specializes in lending rooms for conferences.It was Jan. 8, just two days before the meeting of the heads of the branch of the business, that they really did, and trusted the company, Im said. The company sent out an official letter. Based on the official letter obtained by < Weekly Trend >, the management has indicated that "" the entire management body has designated the Korea Management Association as its representative for wage and collective bargaining with your union, "" and submitted a collective bargaining agreement. As a result, the company announced that it would not negotiate face-to-face with the union.It was not that the union had not been unprepared to delegate the right to negotiate when the company set the meeting with the dogs outside. There is already an example of the Samsung Electronics Service Branch. Therefore, since two months ago, he has been demonstrating with one person in front of the company to ask for earnest negotiations while they were in Seoul.The meeting between the bride and groom families can not be successful. Officials at the federation meeting who were appointed by the management immediately after the meeting extended their power to fill the post. The power of attorney stated that, like an official letter, the union would delegate all of its powers to the federation of economics. In spite of the chill, senior union metal union officials who came out to meet with the head of the unit and the senior dog union left, saying, We will negotiate directly with management.It is legal that Samsung's story has entrusted full power to the federation regarding the alliance. Article 29 of the Labor Union and Labor Relations Mediation Law allows both labor unions and management to delegate the right to a single agreement. There is nothing in the Act that specifies the scope of authority or its effect, if delegated. It is up to the person who has delegated it to decide. All you need to do is inform the other party of the delegation.The union says it will not sit at a table with the delegation from the federation. Lim said, Even small and mid-sized employers are directly involved in the meeting, adding, We delegate the right to organize the partnership to others and refuse to accept it as an act of engaging the union. The management says that there are no legal problems. A Samsung source said, "" As the company has no experience at all in the short circuit and the branch of the union is also scheduled to attend a meeting with the umbrella union, it is not reasonable to delegate any power to the federation. ""It is rare for a large company to delegate a simple association to the Korea Economic Cooperation Federation. It is difficult to say whether Samsung is ready to declare itself as the negotiations are under way, although there have been few cases recently in which large companies have delegated the right to a single agreement, said an official at the federation.It is also hard to believe what the management, who stated as a cause for delegation that he had not worked with the consortium, said. Last year, the Supreme Court approved that Samsung Group's ' S & S labor documents ' were compiled by the Samsung Group, which conducted a series of mock bargaining sessions for 167 senior executives and 192 negotiating experts on a group level of employees. Considering that the Office for Future Strategy, the group's human resources and labor, disbanded just a year ago, experience problems were not the main reasons for delegation.▽ Samsung Eswon DanchuI = If so, how should we interpret the fact that the company has entrusted the association to the federation? Labor views as a classic "" technique "" to undermine union's bargaining power. An official of one labor union said, "" Relegating the right to a single agreement naturally resulted in a backlash from the union, which would result in "" the negotiation being sluggish and not advanced. "" Meanwhile, businesses are finding out the reason behind the union's participation. We can not afford to allow big businesses to sit directly at the negotiating table with metal unions, which are considered to be strong even among the KCTU, said a Samsung Story official.The fact is that the first alliance between Samsung Group and Samsung Group in 80 years has begun to pave the way. The union has asked management to negotiate directly and unilaterally, We will go directly to the company on Jan. 17, and talk there. If management refuses to accept the request and insists on negotiated via delegation, the agreement itself would be defeated and conflicts between the two sides could worsen. Labor unrest could arise, such as strikes, in which legal disputes are expected over whether management violated the statutory duty of "" earnest negotiation. ""It is also crucial how the Samsung S&amp;S Association will proceed. Samsung Eswon, a Korean Confederation of Trade Unions ` labor unions, was recognized as a multI-union union with more than 40 members. Samsung Esewon has another union set up in 2000. Although unification of the windows of the joint venture was the most important factor, the management told the two unions that they would proceed with individual unions. The management's individual partnership with multiple unions is one of the most guarded issues in the labor community since allowing multiple unions to function. By signing a pact in the interest of either union, the labor unions ' ability to unite is weakened. Samsung's Eswon labor union is already worried about this.We can`t understand the stance of the union, which is not to form a united labor union with the union, although it was established in 2000, to express any doubt about the unifiedness of the union. The labor union also believes that before the merger, management could delegate the cooperation to third parties. We will faithfully deal with the two unions by saying the law should respect the unions as it allows multiple unions to do, a Samsung source said."

Students and teachers were alerted to a rash of cases of collective flu. Alabama hospitals are rescheduling completely non-emergency surgeries to treat flu patients. Thirteen children died in 46 U.S. states with flu cases. Including adult patients, 27 patients under the age of 65 died in one of California alone.Britain is also an emergency because of the flu. There are 93 flu deaths this winter, of which 45 have died in the past week. The treatment is being delayed due to a shortage of medical staff, said Daily Telegraph. In France, 12,000 people were hospitalized with flu, killing about 30 people.The entire global village is suffering from the flu this winter. According to the World Health Organization, patients were also in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as North America, Europe and East Asia. In particular, the first outbreak of the Spanish flu in 1918 and the Hong Kong flu in 1968, which killed one million people, has caused a serious threat to the epidemic. "" Some health care experts are concerned that it could turn into a pandemic flu pandemic in 2009 if swift action is not taken, "" the U.S. broadcaster CNBC said.Governments are waging public health campaigns to stop the spread of the flu by avoiding going out, washing hands, and covering one's face when sneezing. Churches in Britain and Ireland have also issued "" no handshake guidelines "" to believers.The main reason for the surge in flu cases around the world this year is the different pattern of flu viruses. The influenza A, which is more likely to develop as a strain than other types, is showing exceptional strength. The H5N1 flu pandemic has been a growing trend in Britain and North America recently since it erupted in Australia in July. It is analyzed that passengers were infected by the infection from Australia to Britain, the United States, and Canada to visit relatives and take a vacation for the holidays. Robert Strang, director of health at Nova Scotia, Canada, said, "" The majority of flu cases in North America were found to have been infected with H3R2. "" China`s Xinhua news agency said, We have been having a hard time dealing with this winter flu since we have seen it very few years before.Another reason is that pharmaceutical companies have prepared the wrong vaccine because the WHO falsely predicted the type of flu. The W.H.O. predicts the B version of the flu will become popular in the Northern Hemisphere this year. However, the flu pandemic was the one with the new type of H3 N2 and the type B type of flu.Some say the flu is not uncommon this year.

"South Korean Sports chairman Lee Ki-heung announced yesterday that she will lead a joint women's ice hockey team at the Pyeongchang Olympics. When Chairman Lee was in the media spotlight and expressed willingness to form a single team, the Korean women ice hockey players slept through long training courses in the Economy class, returning from their U.S. training. From July 26, when we were enjoying the festive mood of the holiday, the athletes who had returned home from a faraway land said, "" I haven't shown much effort, "" and instead expressed frustration over having promoted a unified team. Despite the positive aspect of inter-Korean reconciliation, it is clear that this single team initiative is hasty and overstretched.● A cosmetic entry increase of 23 + α Chairman Lee Ki-heung says he will ask the IOC to expand the roster of athletes to minimize damage. However, expanding the full entry does not increase the number of competitors available to compete. The national women's ice hockey team will field a maximum of 23 athletes, with only 22 allowed to compete in the event. Even though the IOC will increase the total entry level of Tim Korea to around 30, Chairman Lee's wishes do not mean that 22 more entries will be made.In this case, the damage is minimized, but the injury can only increase. You can't get North Korean athletes off the roster by setting up a unified team, and then we can see some of them end up waiting for the North Koreans who are worse off on the Olympics. (I wonder if the Olympic Stadium bench is equipped to seat 22 athletes so I can watch it from my side.) That does not mean that we can add 22 more entries. That's not much different from what we say 15 people would play in soccer. (Ice hockey requires extreme stamina, so athletes must replace it constantly every 50 seconds to 1 minute. More entries are needed to help the athletes to save energy and have a strong influence on their performance.) If the Korean Olympic Committee requests more entries and the IOC accepts them (for political reasons), it is very likely that the other teams will object. And if one of the other teams allows us to enter the game more ... Can we really call our team's game a sport? It is not a sport that competes fairly, but a political show to show the two Koreas a unified team.What was the investment for? Our athletes have made a lot of investment and efforts in recent years to achieve their first ever win at the Olympics, and now they are on the road to success. The Korean women's national team, which had grown to 10-0 and 20-0 in Asia until just a few years ago, is now on par with the international elite. However, when a unified team is formed between the two Koreas, it is inevitable that the team's strength will weaken. Ice hockey is a team sport that has organizational power and teamwork. Our players have been working together for several years to fill the gaps in individual skills and physical strength that are relatively lower than those of the world's best teams.If North Korean athletes join the team with less than a month to go before the event, the organization's ability to boost its competitiveness will inevitably be shattered. Furthermore, North Korean athletes lack individual skills compared to our athletes. (In last year's Gangneung World Championships, we slightly beat North Korea 3-0 and reached the summit by winning.) It is very different from when a single table tennis team or a soccer team of teenagers worked together to create a synergy effect.First of all, people!Our athletes have sacrificed everything by looking only at Pyeongchang. I gave up the dream of becoming a pianist and postponed my dream of becoming a doctor. Without a college team or an unemployed team, I had to work part-time to make a living. (It is virtually impossible for athletes to get a proper job because of competitions or training in battery.The Taeneung Athletes Link, which is used with figure skating players or short-track speed skaters, could not be walked until after 9 p.m. every day, so the athletes could return home after training. What is the significance of a unified team for South and North Korea that ignored their dreams and sweat?The main character is a player tonight! Player!Dear Leader of the Korea Sports Council, For those in the government or IOC, the promotion of the unified Pyeongchang Games team is also a good opportunity to become a historic figure. However, they have many opportunities to become main characters at different times. The North Korean athletes ' participation in the Olympics and joint South-North positions alone will draw global attention, and if we leave the Olympics and promote regular South-North exchanges in sports, we can make peace and reconciliation at any time.Furthermore, the people of the two Koreas do not want a unified team to impose the sacrifice of its athletes. Public polls show overwhelming opposition to a single team, and single-team protests are brewing on the Internet. There is no reason why you shouldn't be applauded.I hope that the athletes who saw the Olympic stage in Pyeongchang will be the main characters.(Photo : Yonhap) Is it a single team for cracks? ② Press reporter Kim Hyung-yeol (henry13@sbs.co.kr) [Even though funds are provided] Please cheer for the health of your paraplegic father and Down-symptom daughter, and check the anti-monetary currency redistribution process here at SBS. The reaction of the two countries, which have been the two main countries for the development of virtual currency, is mixed, and the impact on the market is very compelling. I'm Kim Joong-bae, a reporter. A day after the announcement of South Korea's virtual currency regulations shook the market, Japanese Vice Prime Minister Taro Aso told reporters after a Cabinet meeting that he would not consider sanctions. Aso says he will do his best to grasp the situation for the time being, saying he will pursue related policies with a careful eye to the balance of user protection and innovation. Japan is leading the way in the formulation of virtual currencies. It was recognized as a legal payment method in April last year, and in September it was institutionalized by approving the exchange of virtual currency in cash. Although there were many cases of overheated speculation, such as the fact that more than one hundred million yen of profit was made from our money, the focus was placed on excessive speculative gains such as the tax office's reinforced taxation. Earlier, a survey of global investors by Block Chain Platform, the underlying technology of virtual currency, ranked Japan as the first country to lead the development of virtual currency, followed by South Korea and Russia, with the United States and Russia. Japanese people have never been identified, but the mysterious founder of Bitcone has been closely connected to the country to date, using the Japanese name Satoshinakamoto. Recently, there was even a girl group called virtual money girls. The investment boom and interest in Korea has soared especially during the second half of last year. Representing the international craze over kimchi premiums and Japanese investment, Watanabe is a clear expression that reflects both countries ' investment trends.

"[Seoul Shimbun] Using smart devices such as self-pocketing, we can reduce the departure time by 20 minutes. Twenty minutes at the airport is a magical time to do many things. In terminal 2, smart machines earn 20 minutes.When you scan your passport with an unmanned check-in terminal (kiosk) placed in the center of the departure area, you will see that your boarding pass is printed out. Luggage tags attached to luggage to be shipped abroad can also be printed directly. The tags can be loaded directly and consigned via ' self bag drop ' placed behind the kiosk. It is different from terminal 1 (T1), which requires the help of counter personnel for consignment. Airport officials explained, "" Using smart systems in two terminals, such as calling customs authorities, will shorten the departure time by 20 minutes on average. ""Terminal 2 was ' smart ' to the point. There were ' U-boards ' installed all over the place that automatically guided them. Touch the place you want to go shopping to show how to get there from your current location and the time taken. You can easily find a parked car. Devices to identify their location are placed everywhere, and payment can be made. It is designed to be 2.5 meters wide than the parking lot's terminal 1. A flight information presentation system, which informs the flight departure and arrival time etc., is also supported with the current language of the country concerned. Various information appeared on the screen in order of the words ' Korean-English-Chinese (25 countries) '.It is also noticeable that the users minimized their movements. Public transportation has become closer. It is only 59 meters from the entrance to the 2nd Transportation Center. Compared to terminal 1, 233 meters away to the 1st transportation center, one can ride buses and airport railroads in two terminals quicker and more conveniently. Also, terminal 2 has an indoor lounge so you can get on the bus after taking a rest from the heat or cold depending on the season. Passengers can conveniently choose from an integrated ticket office in the east and west and 24 unmanned kiosks in the center.If you lose your passport or leave it at home, you can go to the center of the second floor without having to worry about anything unexpected. The government comprehensive administration center that has entered provides one-stop administrative service. The vaccination room, overseas travel disease information center, immigration and registration center, customs office, consular service center, military service bureau and materials loss center are concentrated. At terminal 1, the locations of the government offices were distributed, making them rather uncomfortable.In addition, restaurants located in Gangsan Mountain, Seoul, were also included in the tour. Hansik Midam-gil is located in a restaurant on B1F. The restaurant is famous for Jeonju Family Hall, a kimchi hot spot with Seodaemun Hanok house, Sunheenebindae tteok in the plaza market, Soondubu and Uijeongbu Budaebu Stew. It also has a local Shake- swek burger chain that has made inroads into the country in 2016, when it became very popular. It is intended not only to introduce brands that are familiar to foreigners, but also to introduce Korean traditional food culture. It is expected to make a difference from the restaurant area of terminal 1.There is a caution when using Terminal 2, which currently contains Korean Air, Air France, KLM Dutch Airlines and Delta Airlines. Travelers using these airlines should go to Terminal 2 as a matter of course.The problem is the purchase of a co-sharing airplane ticket. Airline companies rent seats from other airlines and sell them as their own to expand flight routes and increase ticket sales. This means that airline companies that purchase tickets and operate airplanes might be different. You can mistake the terminal. Korean Air operates jointly with 23 airlines in the first terminal besides the two terminal families. For example, if you purchase a ticket from Korean Air but have a flight carrier operating in the United Arab Emirates, you must undergo a flight inspection and departure procedures at terminal 1. Conversely, the ticket purchased from UAE Airlines, but Korean Air should use Terminal 2 for joint flights.To prevent misdirection, terminal information will be enhanced on the e-tickets provided when booking a ticket. You should check the terminal on the e-ticket carefully to avoid confusion. Incheon International Airport Corporation plans to send out a terminal information message three hours before departure in cooperation with airline and travel agencies.Gimindo journalist key5088@seoul.co.kr That's not easy for the government to regulate, so let's take a look at some of the problems associated with Lee Tae-kyung, a reporter for the Ministry of Economy and Industry. Lee Tae-kyung, journalist of Cheong Wa Dae, said, "" The Justice Ministry's push to close the exchange is the strongest card it can make. So why did we take out this superconduction card?[reporter : Yeah, well, when the government came up with a few measures, but failed to evolve the speculative frenzy of virtual money, it led to a kind of extreme medicine.The government has taken five major initiatives under the leadership of financial authorities since setting up a joint task force with related agencies last September.In September, the company banned the use of virtual currency to finance the project, and in mid-September last month, they decided to push for a ban on child transactions, and tax on profits.The real name transaction system was adopted and the speculative boom did not subside although the virtual account checking was carried out.Then the Justice Department started to argue that the exchange was closed. [Anchor] Well, we've come up with five measures. Whenever it came out, it was a backlash, and even a petition from the constitution came out. This time, especially investors ' resistance was so strong, and Cheong Wa Dae seems to be stopping at the National Assembly because of the differences in opinion.[NEEDS : Yes, it is true that shutting down was encouraged within the government when the Justice Ministry led the task force, but it appears that Cheong Wa Dae decided that more coordination was needed from a political angle.Finally today, Kim Dong-yeon, the deputy prime minister for economic affairs, directed traffic. Listen to this.[Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economic Affairs Kim Dong-yeon : All ministries agree that a certain level of regulation is needed. The Minister of Justice has talked about closing the exchange, which requires consultations between ministries.[Anchor] In fact, since the virtual currency boom is a worldwide phenomenon, we are the only ones who are concerned about countermeasures. How do you respond overseas?[reporter] Okay, our government is holding the position that "" virtual currency is not a currency or a financial commodity, "" and is holding off on getting it into control.China is on the same page.China blocked investors from taking out of the virtual currency exchange to the yuan in September last year as it overheated.Japan, on the other hand, revised its payment system in April of last year, and virtually brought virtual money into the drawing system.However, it only allowed the state-approved virtual currency exchange to operate and strengthened security regulations.The United States has also allowed the release of gifts for futures by defining virtual currencies as financial products. Our government has once said that virtual currency is not money or commodities, and that it is not considered to be money in Japan, and that the U.S. is not in the currency market, and Japan is not in the currency market.[Anchor] So, depending on how you define virtual currency, your policy is different. Then, what can you expect from our government?[reporter] Okay, so we're going to slow down the market.But it's hard to let the market run in the region.Overheating is also excessive, but the risks of money laundering or hiding illicit funds using virtual money are growing. First of all, as I reported earlier, the financial authorities will reduce the availability of the problem by regulating bank accounts, channels to the exchange.We expect the overheating to calm down slightly as many of our accounts are cut off during this process. ◆ Relevant Report [Single] Financial authorities review bank account suspension for Virtual Counts → One-the-go article : [anchor] Exchange closing, but with some degree of effect of reducing transactions, I think.[reporter] But if the speculation is not settled by offline transactions, the closing of the exchange could be resurfaced.However, he points out that because we can not guarantee passage of the National Assembly and we can do business through overseas exchanges even when the market closes, there is a limit to the eradication of speculation.As a result, instead of taking measures to replace them, the government and the National Assembly should first establish the concept of virtual currency and take appropriate regulatory measures.LEe.taekyong @.co. bc. krs live to YouTube and tips to the news room! ▶ Story, Live, Bisends and JTBC Social Story Copyright http://jtbc.joins.com"
"Despite the excessive debate, the government's position was firm on the speculation wave [CBS Nocut News Chosun Confident Cho Keun-ho], Minister of Justice Park Sang-kee's comments to close the online currency exchange were met with comments from his counterpart, Park Jong-min. Justice Minister Bahk Sang-key said yesterday, We are preparing legislation to ban transactions via the virtual currency exchange with the government, even aiming to scrap the exchange. As the overheated speculation surrounding virtual currency barely subsided, the Korean government officially adopted a precipitation called the shutdown of the Korea Exchange, causing the market to sway significantly. Park, a graduate of the Association of Citizen's Justice, is known to believe that he is just a speculative investment in virtual currency. The Ministry of Justice's view was not significantly different, so Ministry of Justice decided to prohibit the transaction of virtual currency in the first place at the Joint Task Force. However, he failed to make the argument, saying, "" If this happens, the development of block chains, which are the basis of virtual money, can be prevented. "" Because of this, the government's measures were sealed on July 28 by the Justice Ministry's proposal to enact a special law to close virtual currencies. Amid the incident, Minister Park and other related ministries and agencies reportedly agreed to discuss the policy issues together. In fact, when Bahk's remark was made, Financial Services Commission Chairman Choi Jong-koo told the National Assembly at a general meeting of the fourth special committee on the industrial revolution, The justice minister`s remarks were coordinated between ministries and were in consultation. Earlier on July 8, Kim Yong-beom, vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission, said, There is an increase in global financial risks associated with virtual currency and expressed concern that it is too high a risk. Choi Heung-sik, head of the Financial Supervisory Service, also said last month that virtual currency transactions were called "" gamble-raising panels, "" and later the bubble burst. You can make a bet. Financial authorities, mostly concerned about possible damage resulting from overheated speculation and the bubble burst, mostly joined the Justice Ministry, which Minister Park exaggerated as if it were the government's overall stance. The ministry did not respond to Minister Park's comment, saying, "" It is not surprising that the message spread to the public. "" "" I thought I'd talk about the basic stance on virtual bills, but I was surprised to hear that they were closed, "" a ministry official said, adding, "" I don't think the policy part is that the Justice Department would know anything about. "" Eventually, the presidential office of communication chief, Yoon Young-chan, was quoted as saying, "" It is not a definite sign, "" followed by Kim Dong-yeon, deputy prime minister of finance and economy minister, who repeatedly discussed the issue of closing the exchange of measles on July 12 as a related market item that the issue was about to be discussed by the related market authorities at Theskpos. However, despite Minister Bahk's excessive remarks, the government appears firm on its stance that the speculative frenzy over virtual currency should be developed. The government should take preemptive measures against possible backlash, as it is expected to cause enormous damage when the bubble bursts. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economic Affairs Kim Dong-yeon also stressed, All ministries agree on the need for the government to respond to the overheated virtual currency speculation and a certain level of regulation is needed. A presidential official said, If we run into problems here (such as hacking or bubble burst), the government will tell us what it has done so far, adding, "" We should take strong measures to deal with the problem before it gets worse. "" Commercial banks plan to hold off on checking the real name of the virtual currency transaction on July 20, following the government's policy of scrapping virtual accounts that were provided to virtual currency exchanges.▶ 1:1 ▶ No Cut News and a visual news, the edit their own chokeunho21@cbs.co.kr copyright © cbs a No Cut News reserved.The policy ... to the crisscrossing [.Seoul housing prices soared to levels before the two measures and ratios, 8 ] gijaebu bannyeonsae, saying a housing, land and real estate measures six times and standardization policy, the Ministry of Education announced presentation.Parents, on various development plans and Moon Jae-in, such as reconstruction and the fifth floor transfer center that made wool thread the government in May last year six times after the launch of real estate.To come up with ideas but by the 'indefinitely, crackdown on all local overheating of the transactions' policy, Apartment prices in Seoul to weekly rate of growth are '8, 2 property policy' the level.Through the roof. ""I will fix the house"" the Ministry of Strategy and Finance and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport to limit the resale and capital gains tax and the regulations, such as (重課), but the cause, Rather, failure in diagnosis and treatment.'housing prices,' brought political analysts. In addition, various moves by the state-related state administration, including the Ministry of Education's policy of standardization, and the Seoul Metropolitan Government's endorsement of the 50-story apartments in the Gangnam area, also had a strong influence.Real estate information provider Real Estate 114 saw its house price rise from 0.57 percent this week (Jan. 6-12), the final increase of 0.33 percent from last week (August), the highest rate ever reported on July 12. Songpa and Gangnam-gu, which have many apartments to be reconstructed, increased by more than one percent over a week. The upward trend is spreading to neighboring new towns.◇ a new real estate measures 6 and over again, ""control over temperature"" Moon Jae-in, the government in May last year 'June 19 property policy' after the inauguration of every month except July until the end of last year, starting from.Real estate measure was announced. The Roh Moo-hyun government's trial was (再版). 'increased supply' instead of (多) all of them concentrate on the house to regulate focus on the 'suppress demand'. ""Roh Moo-hyun government internally is why you don't get a housing market by adding the regulations in dribs and drabs resist because people are sympathetic to the view that '."" says the ministry official.Said. So, the real estate policy of August 2 was to impose a set of regulations on taxation, lending and subscription. Simgyoeon University professor, said the key government officials about this in media interviews from time to time, to mention the 'The current housing distribution rate 102 percent' that an adequate supply of way.'The house was a lot of housing goes up because of multiple people.' as Roh Moo-hyun government eventually, from diagnosis ""saying"" to the depression in demand, and think.It was wrong, he said. The public wants a new apartment that is not just a home, but a place that is easy to commute.The government, in reality, regarded the deals on apartments and apartments to be reconstructed as speculation and prevented them from being resold. This has had the effect of reducing the number of apartments on the market. The price of tape tapes began to rise when the demand for apartments remained the same, said Kwon Dae-jung, a professor at Myongji University in Seoul.◇ Other government ministries do not know me, and the ministry is even pushing Gangnam to overheat. The ministry said it would scrap the autonomy of private high schools and foreign language schools of preferred selection. If a student fails to attend a regular high school when applying for such a school, he or she must first be accompanied by another student who applied to a regular high school and then enter the remaining seats. It is more likely to be assigned to schools that are too far away from school or with low preference. As a result, the price of Gangnam School District has increased. Shortly after the announcement of the policy in November last year, rental prices in Gangnam, Songpa and Yangcheon-gu were fluctuating and sales prices surged. "" I used to think that ' it's okay to send a foreign language high school to your children anywhere, ' but I've been trying to move to Gangnam since my education policy changed, "" said an executive from Mapo. The central and local governments have also made a false decision. Seoul City approved the de facto reconstruction of apartments in Jamsil Jugong Apts. 5 in September, and Songpa-gu saw a surge in apartments since. Whether the government regulates or encourages the reconstruction has been sent a message to the real estate market. The Seoul Metropolitan Government's plan to promote the underground complex transfer center is also good news for the soaring apartment prices in Gangnam.Another reason for the move is that the government has cut back on investment in SOCs (social overhead capital) such as roads and railways, which are needed. Ko Jong-wan, head of the Korea Asset Management Institute, said, To spread housing demand in Seoul to Gyeonggi Province, we need to actively construct subways and roads to reduce the time gap and reduce the SOC budget outside of the Seoul Metropolitan Government.

"Presidential chief of staff Lim Jong-seok (left) and floor leader of the Free Korea Party Kim Seong-tae shake hands at the National Assembly in Yeouido, Seoul yesterday. Lim is known to have explained to Kim the recent controversy surrounding the United Arab Emirates. United Arab Emirates floor leader Lim Jong-seok and UAE floor leader Kim Seong-tae are expected to call off an agreement to draw up an agreement on whether to build up a political consensus on the nuclear plant. Presidential chief of staff Lim Jong-seok and Kim Seong-tae, floor leader of the Free Korea Party, met at the National Assembly on July 12. We decided to judge various disputes sparked by Lee`s visit to the UAE on the basis of national trust and national interests, the two said. This means that the U.S. government agreed not to discuss the UAE dispute any more although it mobilized political investigations. Both the presidential office and the Korea Party found it difficult to keep the UAE issue afloat, so they sought a political exit. Some say that the presidential chief of staff set a precedent by directly asking the floor leader of the opposition parties to explain to the National Assembly. Rather than meeting between the presidential chief of staff and floor leaders of the main opposition party, the meeting was more likely to turn out to be a solo meeting of UAE lawmakers. Lim was the one who triggered the controversy by visiting UAE and Lebanon last month on a 2-night, four-day visit scheduled for July 9-12. Kim says it “political revenge of the Moon Jae-in government aimed at Lee Myung-bak administration is the nature of the controversy uae” and a sniper attack role. The two of them met at the National Assembly for about an hour and a half. The meeting was made at the request of Cheong Wa Dae, said a GNP official. Kim Moon Jae-in in meeting government about ending a practice that reportedly a non-nuclear level. Right after the meeting, the two announced their agreement in a meeting of five main opposition Grand National Party floor leaders, including Shin Bo-ra. The main point is that the Korea Party has decided to judge the UAE special envoy scandal on the basis of national confidence and national interests. It is meant to settle the controversy over the UAE, although it was mentioned indirectly. Calls for a parliamentary parliamentary committee to investigate the situation and call for the communist party to investigate the UAE case are expected to be withdrawn. The two also agreed to work together on winning contracts for overseas nuclear power plants. He also agreed that there should be continuity between governments for trust with other countries and for diplomatic interests to continue. The two also reached an agreement on compromise. The presidential office and the Korea Party are set to strengthen their cooperation in state affairs. Cheong Wa Dae also promised to explain to the opposition parties the best and seek cooperation when it comes to matters concerning national interests. Both of them showed satisfaction at the meeting. Regarding the constitutional amendment, he said in unison, "" That was not the case. "" The presidential office seems to be relieved at the result of the meeting. We welcome the agreement between Cheong Wa Dae and the opposition parties to resolve the UAE case from the national interest point of view, an official at the presidential office said, adding, We will expand cooperation and communication with the opposition parties on issues of diplomatic security.Kang Yoon-hae, WS-Guest Correspondent justice@kmib.co.kr, When installing patches, the PC turns off randomly and then on again.

Hoswell is a fourth-generation model that was released in 2013.CPU gates have sprung up after Intel's recent discovery of a hack-proof defect in the CPU chip, the x86, for which Intel has been selling.Intel, however, which has been aware of the problem for several months, is suspected of covering up the problem. It was even revealed that some executives, including Chritsanik CEO, sold their shares last November. He also admitted to suspicions that the performance of personal computers might be deteriorated following a security patch. But it is not too much to say. ""Crocknik has also brought charges of ' responding well to the CPU gate problem ' on his own terms.

"" As the coin price is 20 to 30 % higher than the foreign exchange, the word "" kimchi premium "" has been used.
