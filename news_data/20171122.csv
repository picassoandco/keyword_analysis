However, some point out that excessive consumption is encouraged as the design is sensitive to the trend, with the prices of most products being set at around 300,000 won. A recent posting on the Internet community of fashion on July 22 said, "" Long padding is not pretty and its mobility is also a problem, "" sparking a debate over comments. The writer says, "" Nobody would have tried to convince me a few years ago that the reason why I buy long padding is because it's cold, ' Because it's a basic item, ' and ' Because it's pretty, ' "" and "" I didn't want to convince anyone that it was in fashion. "" Some Internet users replied, ' All high school students wear black long padding, it's not pretty, ' ' Too thick and too long with that, ' and ' It's a shame that it's been two years since the trend started. ' Some point out that the popularity of long padding, which costs 300,000 to 500,000 won, is excessive consumption unless it is worn out after a few years. Other Internet users, on the other hand, said, ' It's been more than 10 years since I've worn long padding, ' and ' I should have pointed out that I should have pointed out that I look pretty depending on the person or live in the cold. ' Pyeongchang Long Padding ' is a prime example of how Long Padding has become a major issue in our society today. As the official product of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, the "" Guseongdown Jumper, "" or "" Pyeongchang Long Padding, "" made by Shingsang, is very popular with its cheap price of 149,000 won. Among the 30,000 tickets produced, all of them were sold, and the used trading site is raising the license fee from 170,000 to 200,000 won. As the store was discontinued from being used as an online store in Pyeongchang, offline stores such as Lotte Department Store and outlet were reduced to customers. Shinseong Trading Co., which had no original plans to add, said, We are considering whether to produce more products by checking the capacity of factories.▽ Pyeongchang Longpadding, Popularity of Explosion = Kim Hyun-tae (Yonhap News Agency) = People buy and buy Olympic padding at the Pyeongchang Pop-ups Store on B1F of Lotte Department Store in Songpa, Seoul on July 22. Only 1,000 people were expected to be sold at Lotte Department Store in Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province, on the same day, causing a flurry of buyers waiting for the store. Concerns are growing over the intensifying competition at 2017.11.22mtkht@yna.co.kr with companies jumping on the bandwagon to produce long-padding designs similar to the same kind of products. According to the fashion industry, dozens of companies launched long padding in the past month, and most of them, besides sports and outdoor brands, are now general fashion brands, manufacturing and distribution brands. Most companies also increased production of long padding several times last year. However, due to the nature of the courts, where consumers do not buy multiple gifts, such as shirts and pants, many predict that inventories will be cut drastically during the coming season. Heavendown, once widely popular among teenagers as it was called "" Staple Breaker, "" has seen its popularity plummet due to overheated competition between businesses. All the inventory was left to the companies, who sold the surplus heavy-down products at a substantial discount, and their performance was sluggish. Some companies are offering regular down products, popular last year as long padding trend, at 80 to 90 percent discounts. Industry watchers say, "" As the fashion industry has continued to slow down, I've been trying to boost sales slightly on trendy items. "" They say, "" If the competition is overheated, the popularity rates will finally ease.

"[CBS ' Kim Hyun-jung's News Show] - Referral of execution - drunk assault again in September - not easy to deal with new lawyers - Classic chaebol~Japanese news show : 00:00, Get punished for being easy on the TV But this time, his third son has become the center of controversy. I've been on the news all day yesterday. Kim Dong-sun, who was later known to assault and abuse when drinking with a group of law firm's lawyers on the street in September, created a controversy over supercase. She even shook it by her lawyer's hair. The Korean Bar Association filed a complaint against Kim Dong-sun yesterday. Let's connect with Chairman Kim Hyun of the Korean Bar Association, and why Byun Hye-hyup went into it himself. Hello, Chairman Kim Hyun. How are you? ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Did you accuse Kim Dong-sun yesterday? ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Kim Dong-sun did offer an apology yesterday afternoon. I'll get treatment. I don't know what it is, but she says she's gon na get treatment. Can't you accept this apology? It is difficult to receive Kim Hyun > Because Mr. Dong Sun Kim has a criminal record. Last January, I was drunk at a bar in Cheongdam-dong and slapped two or three employees on the face and on the head for dangerous stuff. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Nene, I hit you. And? As the officer who appeared on the scene said a curse and kicked from a moving patrol car, the Central District Court sentenced him to two years in jail in August and a suspended jail sentence for breaking windows. And yet, after six months I was drunk again and committed almost similar crimes. So, it's very bad drinking. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Very bad. Well, I was a little bit suspicious whether drinking or acting as a punishment was a disease or not. But I can not break this habit For your part, you need to punish yourself harshly so that you won't be called such tyranny again. So we started to file that complaint. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Then I will return to the day of September. Ten new lawyers for a big law firm, Mr. Dong-sun. How did you get together that day? Kim Dong-sun, the third son of Hanwha Group Chairman (photo). (Lee Han-hyung : reporterdigital, photo) Is Kim Hyun-hyun > Kim Dong-sun a member of the shareholders ' group, drunk and call your father ' Let him go ' It means he's a client. Then, make an insulting remark, saying, ' Sit up straight from now on, use polite language. ' ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Kim Dong-sun is 29 years old. It is composed of Kim Hyun > 28 years old. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > 28 years old. The lawyers there are new ... but nowadays it is usually about 30 percent after graduating from university and law school. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. Sit up-side up, even for those older lawyers who are -- what is your father doing?While showing off that his father is a tycoon, there is an identity gap between us. I'm a senior client you should serve. Well, it's kind of like this, and it's very impersonal. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : If it had ended in words, I wouldn't have gone to this far, but how did you get to the point of assault? Kim Hyun : When lawyers helped Kim who was drunk, they slapped him in the face and even shook her by holding the woman lawyer's hair. Many people assume that it was always the same with their subordinates. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Drunk, you must have left now and helped me with something, right? Kim Hyun : He is the one who yelled at police officer and said so. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > So you were under the influence of alcohol and you had to make reasonable doubt about it. Mr Kim : That is ridiculous, therefore, it was the first time it happened, so I was confused and could not respond properly. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I think I can do so there. Embarrassed, I wonder what this is. But these are lawyers. You know the law better than anyone. So when I got home, I couldn't think, well, maybe I would have made a complaint about this, this is an assault, and I couldn't even tell you why I did this in September?However, it is not easy to express oneself actively at any cost because new employees do not have a high annual rate. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : That's what a normal company is like. The same is true of law firms. The law firms are an organization. If I have to look at the facial tissues and when I'm a new lawyer and I show up, I may have trouble in my path. So I guess I just took a very cautious attitude with myself. I understand perfectly. If you're a big law firm like Hanhwa, you're a major client. In short, you're a big customer who gives you a lot of big shots. I guess so. ◇ You don't think it would have been an easy decision for the new lawyer to ask, ' I was right with that client, ' knowing it clearly. It is not easy. I guess Kim Dong-sun knew the weakness and probably went wild. For example, you wouldn't have dared to do that to older lawyers. Would I stay put if I were to do such a thing? ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : I can't stay still. I will report it to the police immediately. They're probably new lawyers, so maybe ... ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > underestimated me. I think there is something like that. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : It is very different from the victim who suffered from cancer that we have seen. They're lawyers for one of the best law firms ever. No, I wonder if such people suffer from this kind of violence. There are many people who are surprised now. It is a typical case of the immoral and twisted chaebol. Money can not help but ignore the economic weakness or the smallness of a person in a position other than oneself and make an assault on him or her. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Some people do. No, he did this to lawyers, so what did he do to others? That's what you think. Kim Hyun > Didn't you do that in January? Two of my employees slapped me on the face and on the head with a distasis, two or three times. I could die. And kicking in a police patrol car is a bit of a light deal. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > No, I even tore the seat on the patrol car. Still only got two years of probation in August? I am sorry. Now, I really hope that Kim Dong-sun will be punished severely and receive some lessons from life. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I hope too. But sir, isn't this a crime of self-insurgency in cases of simple assault? Yes. Lawyer Park Jong-eon (director of legislative support at the Korean Bar Association) meets reporters in front of the Seoul Central District Public Prosecutors ' Office at 5:00 p.m. yesterday. (Photo : Kim Ki-yong) ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > If these new lawyers don't want you to be punished, it's hard to punish your victims. If you do, you can not punish him. But if the lawyers were injured, they could still be punished for injury, even if they don't want to. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > But he could not have told you what happened in September, so isn't it fair to see that new lawyers in other positions agree? Without complaining? Kim Hyun : There were several people sitting on it that day. Not all of the lawyers felt they had accepted an apology. There may still be lawyers who want to be punished. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > even one person. So, if there is a lawyer who wants to punish us after investigating the truth, we will make an effort to punish Kim Dong-sun severely. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : Have you ever had a deep contact with your victims? ◆ Kim Hyun > Yes, since yesterday, the truth investigation has begun and the perpetrators and victims are all in contact. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : Among the victims, who said, "" I don't think we can agree on this? "" Now that the situation has grown like this, I think the nation can take the lead in telling the truth and correcting justice. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > isn't it? If you don't agree to it this time, you can live up to your last month in jail and add another date for this time because the same incident happened again during the suspended jail term. If you receive more than just jail time, it will not work. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. Kim Hyun : You will be punished severely. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : A three-year-old who assaulted his lawyers. It's a very painful thing that the society is very much in a hurry to get involved with this controversy, and that this kind of thing has become a reality, more movies than movies. Mr. Chairman, may I leave a word for you? I was angry to hear that the lawyer was slapped on the face by a client and seized his hair without any mistakes. And if you do this to a lawyer, how reckless are you to do it to the powerless citizens? This should never happen again. We must rectify these low class capitalism. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I strongly agree that it must be corrected. I will keep an eye out for any reasonable punishment, Mr. Kim Dong-sun. Thank you. Thank you. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Kim Dong-sun, the third son of Hanhwa Group. Korean Bar Association Sues Kim Dong-sun's Assault"

"United Nations Command, which recently called the United Nations Security Council on North Korea's Military Demarcation Line on July 22. A United Nations defection soldier was notified Thursday by a phone call to the North's truce village of Panmunjeom in Seoul. When a soldier escaped from the North and failed to move over the chin of a ditch, he saw North Korean soldier Kim GwI-geun fall down on the southern wall of the Joint Security Area (Joint Security Area) on November 13, 2000. However, some point out that there is no appropriate measure to impose sanctions on North Korea, which declared that the armistice agreement would be repealed in 2013 and has been shutting down the direct telephone lines between the United Nations Command and North Korea's armed forces at Panmunjeom for the past four years. The United Nations Command requested a meeting on July 22 to establish measures to prevent North Korea from violating the armistice, but it is not clear whether North Korea will respond. The UNC formed a special investigation team of Korean, U.S., Australian and New Zealand agents and conducted the investigation from July 13 to 20. The UNC explained that officials of Sweden and Switzerland watched the process. The U.N. Command confirmed in its announcement yesterday that the special mission confirmed that the North Korean military exchanged fire outside the border and that North Korean soldiers briefly crossed the border. The UNC reported the violation of the armistice to the North and requested a meeting. It is hard to say whether North Korea should come to the conference room in response to the UNC's request, but if it does not respond, it will have to respond.

The UNC and North Korean forces are also disconnected from the DMZ and can not send out notice of protest to the North Korean military.

The central bank in Zimbabwe was busy printing money to raise money for imports, when it experienced unprecedented hyperinflation in 2008. Mugabe dictatorship such as president of gifts, affection for North Korea and Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il leads to hereditary rule and in admiration for the view. But it was an inappropriate time to enforce the modern version of Noah's Ark that the BBC had expressed. According to the U.S., including cnn the ruler of Zimbabwe for 37 years the world's oldest dictator Mugabe a (93) president suddenly resigned yesterday. The initiation of Mugabe, president of the impeachment procedure was stopped immediately. Mugabe resignation of the president sacked earlier this month made former Vice President and Emerson eumnangageu is expected to exercise his power as Zimbabwe's new leader for a while. First 37 years after the prime minister came to power in 1980 to 41 years younger than this year's wife Grace Mugabe handing over as president after attempting to ‘marital power’ a headwind.That's right the impeachment crisis of its own making. Zimbabwe's military seized government by a de facto coup on July 15. Meanwhile, North Korea is Mugabe, president The resignation of the sticky allies to lose one of the African continent. Zimbabwe and North Korea have had a cataclysmic diplomatic relationship since their independence from Britain in 1980. Mugabe, president visited the total of eight times from 1978 to 1994, North Korea in 1980, notably as chief executive officer, visited Pyongyang, North Korea right after he took office as prime minister met Kim Il-Sung. He is said to have admired Kim Il-sung's absolute power in North Korea and the worship of Kim Il-sung by North Koreans. Mugabe, the president ordered ministers to read Kim's speech will exhibit the book of Juche ideology and so were attracted to the North Korean politics. He made his birthday a national holiday like North Korea. Mugabe in particular in capital, Harare, the president are supported by North Korea in the early 1980s made huge ‘National Hero Cemetery’ (heroes acre). When Kim Il-sung died, he formed a memorial committee and held annual memorial meetings for Kim Il-sung. North Korea is a struggle for independence was then led the fight since Mugabe of Zimbabwe send weapons and military instructor to president, sticky honey moon, such as relationship. Even after formal diplomatic relations, North Korea sent various weapons to Zimbabwe free of charge and sent over 100 military drills to support anti-government activities. Local media ‘New Zimbabwe’ was “Mugabe, president is quite obvious that trying to find inspiration from North Korea choose a successor.” said. Mugabe, president is also uncertain if we can be the disgrace of the posthumous construction of the statue of him. North Korea to The Times recently in the UK, "" Mr Mugabe to celebrate the president's 90th birthday the Mansudae Art Studio is not two a statue of Mugabe was created and made in the warehouse.Rotting away, said. The government's regulations on household loans do not seem to be able to catch on with the increase.According to the Bank of Korea's ' Household Credit during the third fiscal quarter ' announced on July 22, the balance of household credit was 1419.1 trillion won (137.9 trillion won) in the last seven months, a 31.2 trillion won increase from the previous quarter (1387 trillion won). It is the highest ever since the statistics were compiled. Since September last year when household debt amounted to 1,300 trillion won, the figure has soared to 122 trillion won (9.5 percent) in a year. The third quarter growth was slightly smaller than last year's (38.9 trillion won), but expanded from the previous quarter (28.8 trillion won) to the highest level this year. Household credit is the sum of the balance of household loans owed by banks, savings banks, and other financial institutions, including insurance companies, and the amount of money owed by credit card companies, department stores, and car installment. Considering the 10 trillion won increase in loans raised by households in the financial sector recently announced by the financial authorities in October, it is highly likely that the current household debt exceeded 1430 trillion won. Household loans rose 26.9 trillion won to 134.2 trillion won. The increase in mortgage loans and home mortgage loans, especially banks, has led to an increase in the number of banks. Mortgage bank mortgage loans rose by 8 trillion won, far higher than the second fiscal quarter (6.3 trillion won). Credit loans and other loans also increased by 7 trillion won, the biggest increase since the statistics were compiled. Among other loans, the amount of loans extended to Internet-based banks rose 2.7 trillion won. The steep rise in mortgage loans is partly due to increased sales of home and the volume of housing in the third quarter, but the government announced last August that forced Koreans to take the last bus to shore up their real estate regulations. The ongoing demand for collective loans implemented has also contributed to the increase in home loans. Consumer spending rose in the run-up to Chuseok holiday in the third quarter of this year, and the advent of the Internet bank Kakao Bank has seen the rise of credit loans, including credit account loans, appear to have contributed greatly to the holiday season. The balloon effect, in which some of the demand on loan restrictions is shifting to credit, was also added to the increase in other lending.The impact of credit loans on the installment balance of sales as well as individual mortgage loans has increased significantly as new purchases in the second half, said Moon Soo-sang, head of the BOK`s financial statistics team, who said that the improvement in credit loans was the most effective in producing statistics in 2006. However, the increase in lending by the secondary financial institutions has slowed. Household loans reached 309.1 trillion won in the third quarter by non-bank financial institutions, such as savings banks and Community Credit Cooperative Federation, up 4.3 trillion won from the previous quarter. It is the lowest increase in two and a half years since the first quarter of 2015 (1.5 trillion won), when the increase was reduced to a smaller level than the second quarter (2.3 trillion won). It was affected by the government's regulations on the total amount of loans in the secondary financial institutions. The loan volume of other financial institutions, including insurance, rose to 89.9 trillion won in the second quarter, similar to the increase of 8.6 trillion won, which is estimated to be 386 trillion won. Sales credit card and installment purchases were up 3 trillion won to 78 trillion won as the use of credit cards increased ahead of Chuseok. Credit card companies and other credit rating agencies saw their sales increase grow by 3.2 trillion won from the previous quarter (1.8 trillion won), while that of department stores and automakers decreased by 100 billion won. hacho@newsis.com>"
"Lee Dae-hee, a reporter who received Ph.D in Korea, recently turned out to be unemployed. One out of four doctors who obtained degrees from Seoul National University could not find a job even though they tried to find jobs. It is the highest figure since the survey, as even the highest-ranged scholar has been unable to avoid the cold spell in the workplace.According to the National Statistical Portal of the United News Agency, 22.9 percent of those who obtained doctorates in Korea this year were not accepted, according to a survey conducted by researchers who obtained doctorates in 2017. The percentage of unentrepreneured workers was the highest since the survey, with the first survey of 21.3 percent in 2014, 20.3 percent in 2015 and 21.6 percent in 2016.

The most under-employed category was natural sciences, accounting for 29.7 percent of the total doctorates. The results were followed by humanities (28.4 percent), engineering (26.1 percent), arts and physical education (22.3 percent), education and crime (20.6 percent), society (18.3 percent) and medicine (11.8 percent).

The percentage of under-business-related doctors in the Seoul metropolitan area was 24.1 percent, higher than that of non-provided doctors by 21.5 percent. The difficulty of finding a job in the metropolitan area was particularly pronounced this year. The percentage of those who did not get a doctor's degree in the Seoul metropolitan area increased sharply from 20.1 percent in 2015 to 22.2 percent last year. The working status of the employed doctor has not changed much from the previous year. Among wage earners, 66.2 percent of working part-time jobs were employed, 22.2 percent were employed as temporary workers, and 0.8 percent were employed as day laborers. Among non-paid workers, 7.7 percent were employers, 2.7 percent were self-employed and 0.4 percent were unpaid. The proportion of doctors who turn to other countries has increased. When asked about their future residence, 13.2 percent answered that they would live abroad, not in Korea. It is slightly up from last year's 12.2 %.[Table] Ph.D.A.

"Chae Sae-rom, a reporter at Yonhap News Agency, said, "" Apple provided extra copies of the iPhone X, and the additional products are also being sold out immediately and are still on the market. SK Telecom announced on July 22 that it received the iPhone X's fourth online booking at 10:00 a.m. and closed in seven and a half minutes. SK Telecom officials said, It appears the demand for maniacs is attracting a lot of initial reservations, adding, Just like our first and third customers, we expect to have customers open on the day of launch. SK Telecom sold the reserved amount of the reserve sold on July 17 to 2 in just 3 minutes and 1.5 to 50 seconds, respectively, and closed the online reservation for the third time after the original reserve was suspended on July 18. SK Telecom secured additional shares due to the strong sales of the iPhone X and began the fourth reservation sale on the same day. KT and LG U + have been receiving online reservations without a separate deadline since July 17. The initial quantity of iPhone X received from Apple was 150,000 units per year, less than the estimated 8 (200,000 units) in October, and the iPhone's pre-emissioning rate so far is 300,000 units per ton.IPhone X-Reservation srchae@yna.co.kr The private shelter, called ' Dalbong-nye, ' was located at the foot of a mountain in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province. Distance reserved by animal rights groups Kara, as well as buses from Sumsenter, for approximately 40 minutes. When you get off the bus, you can see a dog breeding facility shaped like a plastic house. Above the facilities, open views are provided on every single telephone pole. Dogs growl and wag their tails at volunteers from sticking to fences or even from nowhere. Similarly, about 160 different dogs have very different faces with a lot of vigilance or pleasure. Dalbong-nie was born in the early 2000s from the development of Eunpyeong New Town. People in the redevelopment area left their dogs unattended in the house they were about to tear down, leading to a massive outbreak of abandoned dogs. At that time, not only the development area of Eunpyeong New Town, but also other redevelopment areas saw abandoned dogs with abandoned. There were two options for abandoned dogs left in the redevelopment area : going up to the mountains or becoming a stray dog from the redevelopment area. Some of the dogs that climbed the mountain survived and became ' abandoned dogs that lived in the mountains ' and the abandoned dogs left in the redevelopment area were mostly taken into custody and put to sleep or were taken in by dogs that were seen around. At that time, some dogs that survived were even materialized. Babies who had no positive contact with people grew up in wild and formed groups of dogs. The irony is that most mountain dogs are afraid of humans, and even humans are feared by them. The mere act of being in a group on a mountain seemed intimidating and the media reports of aggressive acts threatening climbers, giving the public a sense that ' dogs on the mountain are dangerous. ' Dogs lived in and out of their homes, vinyl houses. Unmaintained dogs were always exposed to hunger and disease. Discarded dogs stay under the hole in the plastic house and increase their numbers. Dog breeding grounds arranged first after Kara intervened. When strangers came in, dogs put their eyes together with a watchful eye. Meanwhile, the dogs left in Eunpyeong New Town were collected by Won, a resident of the redevelopment area. He was also on the brink of demolition, but he could not turn away the dogs that were starving for hunger and affection. There were about 70 dogs he brought one by one. Dalbong's shelter started out as a group of abandoned abandoned abandoned abandoned abandoned abandoned abandoned abandoned abandoned abandoned abandoned abandoned abandoned dogs in the redevelopment area. Won may not have intended it, but he somehow prevented dogs in the development area of Eunpyeong New Town from becoming homeless. However, the unneutralized dogs cross-crossed each other and increased their populations to 200. Dogs have been vulnerable to disease, not eating properly and also eating moss-stained water. The sick dogs were not treated in time. Dogs managed to live or die with their sky-free plastic houses at home. It was impossible for a single excollector to handle many animals that neither the dog owner nor the local government nor the nation was willing to face. The shelter, which had been going through days like a time bomb without anyone helping, was relieved by Kara's decision to support them. The government has begun to maintain the environment of the strap-free vinyl houses and manage the buildings individually with necessary medical measures such as neutralization operations. The move was designed to provide the right model for private shelters while preventing the problem of dogs. However, the home of shelter was also a redevelopment area. Within a few months of starting to apply, an order was issued to file immediately. It was predicted, but Won, who lives from hand to mouth, could not handle it alone. However, they were not able to get the dogs to radiate to the mountain. Still, there was an opportunity. When the singer Sumi Jo, who had heard the sad story, began to serve, and Kara reminded society of the problem of abandoned dogs in the redevelopment area, so it began its work to move the shelter. It was a voluntary protection for dogs from the area and needed to catch and move wild dogs, but the city of Goyang and fire department turned their backs calmly. With the support of citizens and efforts of Kara activists alone, 180 large exoders were made. After dozens of volunteer work, DalbongnI was able to get shelter from the elements under the quiet. Now, dogs with similar personalities are staying together at Dalbong's shelter. Dogs in this area are generally wary of people. They may be born with abandoned dogs and feel strange to people. It is heartbreaking to leave behind, but fortunate to be in a well-groomed dog's home, eating regularly and being in a safe. Dalbong Community Center, moved to Goyang City. He closed the area where the dog farm was and used the structure of a plastic house. Dalbong's dogs ' lives have become better than they used to be in Eunpyeong-gu. Instead of picking up food waste, you can eat donated food and get treatment if you are sick. But you can not expect to receive complete and delicate affection. Dogs will live with limited touch and live in confined spaces until they meet a family they want to adopt. In the hands of those who have left them or others who are responsible for the system that made them throw away. Think of the dogs that live in the mountains. We went to the mountains to live, but we survived because we were called the "" Order of the People, "" and when we saw wild dogs standing at the crossroads of human relations, we were told that they were against humans, and that we were waiting for human beings to fail in a tragedy. It is only when we remember that the conveniences of our lives have driven dogs into the mountains, that we have a sense of challenge and responsibility. It is only when society has a more mature footprint that it has to offer. Write-Photosphor Kim Na-yeon Correspondent and Zoniciant-Protection Cara Activist. Be Best Hangers!

"Police are set to launch a criminal investigation into the case against Byeon Hyung-hyup, and Kim Seung-youn, chairman of the CCTV restoration effort and chief of the presidential staff as a father, police said. The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency sent six police officers to a bar in Gwancheol-dong, Seoul, on September 21 to receive a CCTV video storage device. CCTV footage of the incident has been unavailable for more than a week, but police are trying to restore the deleted images. The team also conducted a field survey on employees. Police also sent two police officers to Kim & Chang's law office. We secured contact information for some of the victims and tried to investigate, but the parties are now avoiding contact, said an official of the metropolitan team. About two months ago, Kim had a drink with about 10 new Kim & Chang lawyers at the bar. Inebriated Kim told lawyers, What is your father doing? Call me the shareholder. The first offense to apply to him in police investigations is assault. However, the victim could avoid punishment if she agreed that it was a crime against humanity that would not hold her with criminal responsibility if she did not wish to be punished. If some of the victims submit a medical certificate, Kim could face a possible injury charge. The suspect of the injury is subject to criminal punishment whether or not he agrees to it. The Korean Bar Association (chairman Kim Hyun) denounced Kim to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office Friday on suspicion of assault and insults. It is hard to see the precedent when the Korean Bar Association directly accused the parties on behalf of them. We confirmed that there had been an assault and received the indictment, said lawyer Park Jong-eon, who issued the indictment. As we tend to abuse young lawyers, we want to actively represent our position to protect the rights and interests of our young members, Kim said. The Korean Bar Association also began an investigation into the damages. The Seoul Bar Association also issued a statement saying, The assault on the lawyer of the chaebol group three-year-old, who is a client of the Super-gap, is a serious challenge to the rule of law. The Korean Association of Women and Justice said, It is very deplorable that law firms have acted to neglect the cases and to ignore the welfare of their lawyers for months after watching them closely. Kim also tore the seat on a patrol car that assaulted and drove to a bar in Cheongdam-dong, Seoul, in January. He was handed over to trial in March and sentenced to two years in jail in August for special assault and vandalism. Since the incident took place within three years of the sentence, Kim can not receive a stay of execution if he is found guilty because he is indicted again. If the recent case resulted in a sentence of more than a safe, the previous suspension of execution will be canceled and the jail will have to serve an additional sentence in August. However, even if Kim is tried, it is possible that a final decision will not be made until March, 2019, the two year suspended sentence. In addition, the prosecution may not be able to investigate. I really feel sorry for myself and I just dislike myself now, Kim said in a statement to Hanwha. We could not remember anything bad from the time because we were so drunk, he said. `` I will actively consult and treat you with deep reflection, '' he said. Chairman Kim Seung-youn also said, It seems impossible to raise a child at will. I feel responsible as a father, and most importantly apologize to the victims. Kim was questioned by the police over a similar incident in 2010. A hotel bar in Yongsan, Seoul, was booked on charges of molesting a waitress, arguing with a security guard, and breaking down windows and furniture. In this case, the prosecution held a stay of indictment in agreement with the victims.

If the teacher and the principal felt threatened, they should stop taking the exam and evacuate the test. Without clear guidelines, can teachers and principals who are not expert in earthquakes make sound judgments when considering the sensitivities of CSAT? Seismic Accelerometers installed at National Exam Center in Pohang. A ' helper ' of a site supervisor who determines risks or escape situations. An earthquake accelerometer is a type of earthquake detector that displays the shaking and size of a building during an earthquake. The graphs and figures show the amount of force shaking the building in real time. A graduate student at the North Gyeongsang Provincial Office of Education said, The 12 seismic accelerometers at the exam centers will be operated by the Geological Environment of Pukyong University, where they will be connected to monitor the entire situation on the day of the CSAT. At what level an earthquake will escape, etc., depends on the site conditions. An earthquake accelerometer is composed of a measuring sensor and computer that is about the size of an adult's palm. It is not easy to see an earthquake alarm because it can be measured only with a separate sensor placed in one area of the exam hall.

In addition, they will not take separate windows and tarpings from exam rooms. On July 21, two days before the national college entrance examination, high school seniors study independently at the reading room of Pohang Iron & Steel High School. Instead of free admission ceremonies, bus rentals are set for 45 people outside the exam hall and are to be used when evacuation situations or emergency changes are needed. Four firefighters were assigned to 12 exam centers in Pohang. A professional psychological counselor, health teacher, and medical staff will also be at each of the exam centers. Government officials also prepare for emergencies near exam centers. Police will deploy two police officers each at 12 exam centers in Pohang on the day of the national college entrance examination to ensure the safety of the examinees and to maintain their own order. In addition, police officers will be dispatched to each of the troubled areas. If the test site is changed in Pohang, and the test area is moved to the preliminary test area, the patrol car will escort it directly.

"" `` What are we better than North Korea? '' he said, adding, `` We were exposed to all of the parasites, internal fecal matter and even the corn on the stomach while the soldier was being treated in the south. '' After emphasizing that military intelligence personnel entered the operating room while the soldier was operated, it was not aimed at saving patients from the start, but were ideologically managed, negative social responsibility and ethics of medical care were emphasized. It is also a criminal act that violated the current medical law. Kim criticized Professor Lee again on July 22. He posted on Facebook, saying, "" It was reported to the media as being violently opposed to me, so before that, I should not have expressed any deep public responsibility or regret for the violation of medical ethics and basic principles. "" We are banning it. That is the spirit of the law.

"77 % of violent dating offenders perceive romantic love as the dominant and owning relationship between women and hate cultures, and are unable to part from other people's opinions and opinions on social networking sites or to become violent, "" The way of doing things with love is ultimately about being a lover, "" Love can only be arranged by mutual consent, but separation is effective by one side's decision. You can not control the decision just because you once loved her. A 29-year-old man was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in jail after visiting his girlfriend (23) who had announced the split and threatening to notify his parents if they don`t meet again.Police arrested a 17-year-old teenager who tried to stab to death after waving a knife at another man because his estranged lover (20) started dating.The day after I was told to say goodbye, a 17-year-old high school student was arrested for stabbing away and running his girlfriend ` mother, who was opposed to dating.`` These are the stories of separation crimes that have been reported in the media over the past month. We do not wish for a beautiful separation that would thank each other for the memories they have had so far and wish each other happiness in the future. It's been several years since the word ' safe separation ' became widely used as a new-word. Only proper lovers can say goodbye, but why is separation so ugly and ugly? Perpetrators who commit separation are usually victims of male separation. Some people are cars, some are cars. The greater pain that the electron has to suffer - sometimes unilaterally - is often released into the form of violence, usually in men. According to the National Police Agency analysis of the status of dating violence in 2016, the total number of people booked on trial last year for dating violence was 8,367 (449 arrested), up 8.8 percent from the previous year. Among them, males dominated the survey with 77.6 percent, followed by females with 5.3 percent and both with 17.1 percent. Among the crimes, violence and injury were the highest with 69.2 percent, and threats of arrest, detention, murder, murder, murder, and attempted murder were 13.1 percent, and sexual violence was 2.5 percent. A total of 4,565 people were arrested in the first half of this year on suspicion of dating violence, and 25 double murder and attempted murder, nearly losing or losing their lives to their loved ones to four children a month. Since separation notification was the main cause of violence, and when it was revealed by the National Police Agency that it was the first time to avoid meeting victims on the phone due to threats of dating violence, The wrong desire to own and control makes love a crime. The Getty image bank romance is closely connected to a misogynist culture in which men typically commit crimes by men rather than by ownership and control. Such an attitude, which refuses to accept women as objects of love and separation, leads to the belief that it is the man who is wise to go out, and the person who can tell him or her to leave is the man. The idea that women have no right to refuse to be on a date or leave leads to a separation crime. The unilateral notice of separation without consideration for the other party is contrary to the ethics of separation, but the fact that the majority of the abuse against failed separation is violent proves how prevalent the misogynism is in dating. Recognition that the cause of separation lies not in our difference or my folly, but in your wickedness. There is a mistaken notion that punishing it is just violence. (Friedrich Nietzsche) Shin Kyung-ah, a sociology professor at the University of Hanlim, acknowledged that "" misundering romantic relationships as the relationship between dominance and ownership does not create a huge sense of loss and deprivation of culture when lovers say goodbye. "" "" It's about projecting anger, complex and inferiority complex from men into relationships. I thought, "" You're going to leave me. "" So I can't stand loss. In the past, when a girl friend asked to say goodbye, he or she would often express the sense of loss by committing suicide or injuring herself, he is becoming very aggressive by using violence against his lovers. Because there is a cultural code in Korean society that makes it easy for men to avoid hitting women. "" Love can never coexist with violence. If you are afraid of your lover, it is a strong sign of your instinct that it is not love. The false view that a relationship in control of the Getty image bank can turn into a violent form due to a separation offense is distributed throughout the country regardless of popular culture and pure culture. It is not just physical violence. Sexual violence, such as verbal abuse, verbal abuse, and intimidation, is often portrayed in novels or dramas as an expression of love. She loved so much that she began to get criticized in social controversies after years of indiscriminate abuse, slandering, and sexually assaulting herThe hunger for intimate attachment is a natural human need. However, as the need grows, the desire to show off increases, which makes couples fall into the category of possessive pronouns. From little puns of ' You Are mine ' to controlling things like ' Don't Wear a Short Dress ' and ' Don't Drink with Your Guy '. Control is the most important factor recognized in recent years for love-have violence in addition to physical, verbal, emotional and sexual violence.Women's telephone operator Sohn Moon-sook, quoted as saying, The offenders of separation crimes are mostly directed from the beginning of a relationship, forcing the ultimate aim of violence to be control. She loved so much that she broke the walls and made a self-injury fuss about it is also the desire for control to let her lover move her way. "" Saying I'd die without you is another way to provoke remorse and restore control in women. If you use verbal and emotional violence during a relationship and then declare a separation in order to get away from it, you say, "" I love you so much that you can't resist being absent because you're in love and you're in control. Lovers ' control has easily been reduced to love springs from saving and worrying thoughts. However, control is not just a factor expanding the definition of violence to a broad sphere, but an essential feature penetrating crimes against lovers. Professor Shin said, "" Control is the foot of self-love, not of the other person. "" "" It's not because I love my lover, it's not because I want to be in control of myself, but because I want to be selfish. "" "" Initially, it begins with light intervention, becomes a force, tries to dominate, and if it does not turn out to be its own thing, violence is practiced. Women's studies suggest that we should be closer to each other than physical violence to determine whether there is coercion involved. If you have excessive intervention or pressure like ' Report anywhere every time ' -- it's violence, in a nutshell -- it's a sign of violence. "" Love is a form of personality. The culture of recognition created by Getty image bank SNS ... is making it harder to say goodbye to others and the world of social media, which is being shown and evaluated every single moment of every day, also harder to say goodbye. The younger generation of ' ㅇ ㅈ Culture ' that considers being recognized by others an important factor in making decisions and judging values does not leave romantic relationships solely as an exclusive relationship between the two. "" It's not just the relationship between friends that ended when the relationship broke up that the younger generation, who posted their photos with their lovers on Facebook and Instagram, says they had a hard time believing that their relationship had developed. "" "" Social Media has given us a much greater chance of creating new relationships than the previous generation, and that's why we've made our separation better. But I'm not sure how to say goodbye. You have no idea what separation is right, what is the etiquette of separation. "" And he said, "" I don't think you should be able to handle conflict wisely, I don't know what's going to happen, and I don't know what's going to happen to you.Travel writer Kim Nam-hee wrote in a column titled `` Safe Break Away, '' written two years ago by Hankook Ilbo, My love can not be stronger than my personality.

"The second generation electric car era has been opened, driving 500km on a single charge, and electric cars with models less than 5 seconds of electric power are evolving to high performance over eco-friendly ones. To make the battery more efficient, the small and midsize electric cars have appeared on the market of smaller models.As GM's Bolt and Tesla models, which can run for more than 300 kilometers on a single charge at the beginning of this year, came out, Toyota, Daimler, and Hyundai Kia Motors also responded actively. The automakers will offer 500km per charge and a series of cars with a Zeroback (time taken from rest to 100km per hour) under five seconds. This has led the industry to see the emergence of an era of the ' second generation electric car ' that has dramatically improved driving distances and power. ▽ Graphic = Yoo Doo-ho (1st generation electric car) = The first generation electric car with the high performance which pours out of the first generation electric car was developed with less emphasis on battery capacity and less on environmental friendly and fuel economy. Most of the models of the electric car, including Nissan's Leaf, BMW's O3 and GM's Bolt, had small bodies. The body had to be light to increase the mileage while consuming less battery.However, Tesla's presence revolutionized the electric car era. "" The first generation electric cars have built up smaller and more practical bodies to compete with leading internal combustion superchargers, such as gasoline and diesel, "" said an official from the automotive industry, "" with advanced battery technology.Polstar is the most famous. Polstar is a high-end electric car brand that gained independence from Volvo cars last June. We will foster Polstar as the high-end brand based on the world`s No.1 electric motor, Volvo said. Last October, Polsta1, a two-door four-seater sports coupe, unveiled. The plug-in hybrid produces up to 600 horsepower.Honda also unveiled its sport-electricity concept model at the Tokyo Motor Show in Japan last month. Honda Chief Executive Officer Takahiro Hachigo said, The car is designed to appeal to many people with its artificial intelligence, high performance and high-efficiency motorized powertrain. Jaguar is set to release the sport utility vehicle, the I-Face, next year's fastest electric car with 400 horsepower and four seconds of power.Electric car makers are also introducing high-performance vehicles. Tesla revealed the latest version of the Roadster Electric Vehicle, which had a record performance of 1.9 seconds. The maximum speed is 402 kilometers per hour. U.S. electric startup giant Lucid Motors Corp. has also launched Russide Air, which can run for up to 643 kilometers on a single charge, and Karmato Mortivo Leveve, a high-end sports plug-in hybrid vehicle.◇ German car brands that used to be diesel but have not yet been equipped with high performance electric cars = German car makers, including Benz, who used to be used for internal combustion engines with diesel, are now offering high performance electric cars. BMW unveiled its four-door Gran Corpe Concept car, I Vision Dynamics, at the Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany in September. It can run 600km per charging, and its maximum speed is 200kmh. It is a high-performance electric car with a four second speed.Mercedes-Benz also unveiled Project One, a high-performance plug-in hybrid vehicle, at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September. The car uses a 1.6 litre 6-cylinder engine and four electric motors to produce a maximum output of 1000 horsepower.Audi also launched the e-trone Quattro concept in 2015, developing high-performance electric cars. The car has a top speed of 210 kilometers per hour and a zero to 4.6 seconds. Volkswagen has also announced that it will develop its four-wheel drive vehicle to participate in the most famous mountain race, the Pikes Peak.Sports car brand Porsche has been developing a four-passenger electric sports car named Mission E since 2015. Porsche explains it will run more than 500 kilometers with a Zeroback of 3.5 seconds, maximum power of 600 horsepower.◇ Electric cars are more suitable for high performance vehicles than electric cars due to the nature of electric cars. Unlike internal combustion engines that bring about small explosions in the engine room, electric cars can turn the motor directly through electricity, which makes them go under good initial acceleration. It means you can use the best power from the beginning. Because of this, the stove is much better than an internal combustion locomotive. Large batteries also allow the car to have a lower center of gravity, allowing for stable cornering. It costs a lot to make internal combustion engines high-performance, but since electric cars have a higher-performance nature, it is not as difficult as before. And with the advent of the technology, high-powered, high-capacity batteries have made it possible to maximize and extract the power of the vehicle.As the electric car market grows, more electric cars will become more common next year, said Professor Kim Pil-soo of Daerim University, who is known for its specialized and sophisticated vehicles.  The United Nations Command, which analyzed images without permission, declared the North Korean Armistice Agreement :Kim Soo-young will explain in detail what was violated.There are two main violations of the North Korean military armistice agreement.First, the North Korean army descended to the south from the Military Demarcation Line.A group of gunmen who were chasing a fugitive soldier came down to the floor of the Central Nations Supervisory Commission building at Panmunjeom and went back.Since the middle point of the conference hall building is the Military Demarcation Line, it has been moved seven steps in our area.Second, the North Korean army opened fire in our area.Even when the soldier had crossed over to our area, the advance teams continued to fire, and one fell down and fired at the target.The UNC has reserved the judgment of a breach of ceasefire in areas where the North Korean military used AKs.Under the ceasefire agreement, security personnel can carry guns and rifles but can not use automatic weapons because it is difficult to immediately check whether North Korea's armed AKs are automated.The UNSC says the probe was carried out by a four-nation team of South Korea, the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and officials from Sweden and Switzerland, who were members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, observed the process.Chad Carroller, spokesman for the United Nations Command, announced these violations today through a communication channel in the truce village of Panmunjeom and the UNC reported that the North Korean military forces had lost contact with the border ‥.The UNC has proposed meetings to the North to come up with a measure to prevent a recurrence, but no clear solution has been made if North Korea fails to comply. It's the so-called black ice phenomenon, where moisture freezes slightly on the road, and you should be careful when you drive in the morning and evening, as the temperature has dropped.I'm a reporter for Park Chan Geun.Cars are crushed and stuck fast.There was a car accident which crashed into the 14th car at around 7:50 this morning at Ilsan Bridge in Goyang City, Gyeonggido.Thirteen people were injured in the accident, and two of them were closed for an hour by three cars bound for Ilsan.[Department traffic survey manager in Yoosunsan : The road surface is frozen, so it is thought that the car in front of you slips and crashed several cars behind.] At 6:40 a.m., four cars collided with each other on Freedom Day, killing one person and injuring two others.Both accidents were reported to have been caused by what they say is a "" black ice sheet "" forming a thin layer over the asphalt.[Hong Seong-min / Transportation Safety Authority Doctor : Because of the humidity associated with the snow and rivers that were originally applied the previous day, it is most likely that it was frozen and formed black ice at night.] Black Ice can occur without rain or snow, and you should be more careful in the morning and at night because it is not visible."
"[Donga Ilbo] Hongsan Elementary School, or nearby elementary schools with no metal reinforced with only part of the inside walls of the construction .... The addition of reinforcing steel inside and the thickness of the walls reduces earthquake damage. Pohang : Gu Byeong-kyo, a reporter at Gupyeonggyo, said, "" That brick protected our school, "" and pointed to the outer wall of the building yesterday at Namsan Elementary School in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province. Most of the red bricks decorated with the outer walls were dark, but only the parts pointed out by Hwang were bright. It is the place where earthquake reinforcement was made. Beginning in January this year, three months of reinforcement work was carried out on the wall, which is designed to strengthen the core with reinforcing bars and thick cement. Namsan Elementary School in the southeastern city of Yeonpyeong, which was founded in 1998, was attended by 301 students. It is about 1.6 kilometers from the epicenter of the 5.4 earthquake that hit on July 15. But only a fraction of the damage was to the crack in the wall walls. There was little external damage. It is hard to believe that it is so close to the epicenter when you look at it. Eight months ago, an earthquake-resistant earthquake prevented earthquakes. New bricks are nowhere to be cracked, Hwang said. It makes me dizzy to think what would have happened if we had not done so. ○ Reducing damages by earthquake reinforcement only, Daedojung (photo above) added columns to increase the strength and stiffness of the columns by adding steel plates to the walls of buildings. In the middle of the study (pictured below), vibration damper was installed to distribute the energy of the earthquake. Pohang : Gubyeonggyo journalist, Heungdong Elementary School, which is about 1km away from Namsan Elementary School, was opened by a reporter. As the main building of Heung-ae Elementary School was severely damaged, bent bars were sticking out. Seo, on the other hand, suffered only slight damage due to some cracks in the wall walls. Although the same school, the main building (1968) was not subject to the anti-seismic design obligations introduced in 1988. No anti-seismic reinforcements were made. Seogwan was reintroduced to be earthquake-proof in 2012. Most of the students study in the main building. In the end, 330 elementary school students at the junior high school will go to Namsan elementary school next week. Some schools have also reduced the damages due to the damages from last year's Gyeongju earthquake and hasty earthquake. Yanghak Middle School collapsed during the September 12 earthquake. Then, they placed "" anchors "" on the outside of the building to help reduce earthquakes. From the outside, it looks like a nail in the wall. Anchors have a strong coupling effect between adhesives and bricks. It also has a device to absorb vibrations. As a result, only a few minor cracks occurred during the earthquake. Pohang Girls ' High School, Pohang Girls ' High School, and Pohang Girls ' High School, which were originally equipped with earthquake-resistant materials, were the only schools that had ever tested for college mathematics. Due to the earthquake, the designated places for test takers at Pohang High School and Pohang Girls ' High School were cancelled. Pohang Girls ' High School is still test-taking. Park Yong-woong, an administrative officer at Pohang Girls ` High School in Seoul, explained, Experts diagnosed him with not enough damage to cause structural problems in the building.○ Seismic Retroduce by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education began in January this year and continued until March. Some parents were worried as construction proceeded even after the new semester started. The school explained in detail the importance of anti-seismic reinforcement and asked for an explanation. Parents were all relieved after the Pohang earthquake. Parents, who are 43, said, All of the parents were convinced by the school`s detailed explanation. Now I feel fortunate. According to the Gyeongbuk-do Office of Education, most schools that were designed to have earthquake-resistant measures or were designed during construction do not need to undergo a thorough safety check. That means no structural damage was seen at these schools that could possibly cause disruptions. Currently, 115 out of 328 schools in Pohang are earthquake-proof or anti-seismic. The Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education announced yesterday a measure to manage the facilities to create a safe educational environment by setting up schools four years earlier than planned to complete the anti-seismic measures. We will spend 51.6 billion won every year to have anti-seismic capabilities in all schools in Seoul by 2030, said an official at the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education.Pohang : Hwang Seong-ho, reporter of Gugyo High School and Kim Ha-kyung, hsh0330@donga.comU.S. space agency astronaut Randy Bresnik showed pictures of Korea and Japan via his Twitter site Friday.Korea is located on the left, with the weather forecast to be cloudy, and Japan on the right. The flashing lights are absolutely beautiful, but it is not the night view of the two countries that astronaut Randy focuses on.In the middle of the picture, you can see a large circle of lights, densely packed with white spots floating on the ocean. It is no other than a fishing boat. Bresnik posted the picture on Twitter, saying `` The fishing boats look like fireflies in a bottle between South Korea and Japan. It is so beautiful.Bresnik's simple comment does not give an exact picture of the situation, but it can be inferred. First, the lights are a fish lantern, which can be seen as a fishing boat for squid. Also, the color of the lights in our country is mostly orange, whereas Japan is hidden in the clouds but it gives off a thick green light. This is mainly due to the high pressure sodium that Korea uses, and mercury lamps that Japan uses.Park Jong-ik, journalist pji@seoul.co.kr It will provide incentives ranging from 65 billion won to semiconductor business partners and bonuses ranging from executives to employees in the semiconductor sector worth 400 percent of the basic salary.

We assembled the iPhone every 11 hours at the Foxconn factory in Henan Province, China, "" the 17-year-old high school student told FT. It is not only against the International Labor Organization agreement, but also illegal under Chinese law to work 11 hours a day. Currently, the factory has 3,000 students, including the six, working as an internship program since last September. Students claim that they are working at the factory after being told by the school that they need to have three months of ' work experience ' before they can graduate.One student said, "" The school forced us here. It has nothing to do with our studies. `` We assembled 1,200 iPhones in a day, '' another student said.FT points out that the supply shortage of iPhone X is at the center of such abuse. Prior to its release, the iPhone X had been in serious supply shortages due to oversupply. Even in the first country to arrive in the United States, reports of waiting 4 to 6 weeks after reservations were made were posted. As for Korea, the expectation of waiting until next year was prevalent. However, the supply shortage has begun to ease a little recently. Online Apple stores in the United States, Japan, and Europe, and major mobile operators, online stores, say they can take two to three weeks to receive an order for an iPhone X and ship products. It is one week shorter than the latest ' 3-4 weeks ' mark.The IT media, Durbear, pointed out that "" Prior to the news of the illegal labor abuse by the former iPhone X, the supply shortage of the iPhone X was the issue, "" forcing teenagers to abuse it illegally to increase production.However, Apple and Foxconn denied any wrongdoing.Apple said, We confirmed from the audit that there were extended work opportunities for high school internships in China, even though they did their work voluntarily and were fully compensated.

"The Democratic Party's Park Kwang-on-Dong Distribution List : New York Housing Price Standard ; City Ranguage 120km … Seoul is similar to the "" Tokyo~Robada Bay "" price point. The news articles became the most read news on major portal sites. Seeing this, the young men and the homeless were enraged. The comment section was filled with thousands of complaints, including, again, Hell-Josen and Na-ha. However, it was confirmed that the article had several crucial errors.As the journal confirmed through the National Assembly Research Service, the source of the press releases was statistical data from the global consulting firm, Demo Grafia International. However, her data were very different from the original data. Park changed the original version of ' Tokyo-Yokoku ' to ' Tokyo, ' and ' New York, New York, New York, - New Jersey and Pennsylvania, ' respectively. Tokyo, on the administrative district, consists of 23 districts and 26 cities, and its area is 3.6 times larger than that of Seoul. Our usual definition of ‘ Tokyo ’ is for 23 districts. The housing prices of foreign metropolitan areas appear significantly lower than they really are, with statistics containing a wide range of surrounding areas.The original data explained that ' this data span the metropolitan housing market and was approximately 120 kilometers from the center of the city ', and described as an ' important attribute ' of the data. However, none of the press releases explained the story.The original data showed that there was no housing price in Seoul. Seoul, like other cities, can be designated as the Seoul Metropolitan Area's radius of up to 120km to include Inje-gun, Gangwon Province and Jincheon-gun, Chungbuk. However, Park brought home the limit on housing prices in downtown Seoul. As a result, the housing price in Seoul is 1.4 times higher than in Tokyo, Japan and 2.2 times higher than in Osaka. Because of this distortion, the housing price in Seoul has become similar to New York City, the capital of the world.It is not easy to compare the absolute housing values between countries. Different countries have different main types of houses and different statistical classifications.According to comparable statistics, the average price of an apartment in Seoul last year was 21.31 million won, and that of an apartment in Tokyo's 23 district was 3.63 million won. New York City has the most expensive housing area of Manhattan and Seoul, of the 25 most expensive districts in the city, and the average apartment price of Gangnam, Seocho, Songpa, and Gangdong is $ 4.38 billion.Park explained to reporters Tuesday, "" We made a mistake in marking the administrative district, "" but there were no follow-up measures such as correcting the data until Tuesday.

"Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel is lost in thought during a parliamentary meeting on July 21 (local time). 【 = Newsis, Seoul, Korea and Lee Ji Ye, 2017.11.22 Journalist : German Chancellor Angela Merkel failed to form the coalition government with Prime Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier of the worst political crisis.The president is noteworthy whether Chon, can be a fixer of what has happened. Deutsche Welle broadcast on (local time) the parliament cabinet system in Germany, the president is only symbolic place, but Merkel as hard as this president's Frank-Walter Steinmeier.Analysis of expected to need help. In Germany the Prime Minister is the de facto supreme power. The president is to reinforce the symbolic head of state for the democratic accountability of government role. Congress, not a referendum vote in its decision is also elected president. But now, is facing challenges in the incoming government ready to launch as president is serious if the authority. President dismiss Prime Minister lost parliamentary support or dissolution of the Federal House of Representatives and holds the power to summon a new election. Merkel's pro-Christian Democratic Party (CDU) and Socialist Socialist Party (CSU) union held the first party in the general elections in September but received only 33 percent of the votes. In response, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (FDP) and the Green Party tried to form a coalition with each other, but negotiations broke down on July 20.◇ Contending concessions to form alliances with different parties = The SDP persuasion is expected. He met the leaders of each party one by one and pleaded for a compromise. He will have a meeting with FDP and Green Party members on July 21 and with Chairman Martin Schultz the next day. The possibility of a coalition is slim at present. The CDU-CSU, FDP and Green Party's coalition was split as the FDP stormed off the negotiating table. SPD, which had previously formed a CDU-CSU coalition, vowed to remain as an opposition when it remained in the second largest party under the oath. But there remains hope that Steinmeier will act as a mediator between Merkel and SPD. Frank-Walter Steinmeier is the president in February before spd who had switched sides. German neutrality does not have the party as a matter is president. Steinmeier is a leading figure in the SPD. To prepare for spd until the president worked as deputy prime minister and foreign minister. Moving beyond ideologies and toward practical lines, she is an longtime partner and competitor to Merkel. Accordingly, Schultz is president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier's reconstruction is likely to persuade the coalition with - csu cdu. Steinmeier is expected to appeal for a loosening of its strong stance to avoid the unprecedented voting.【 Newsis and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany and Berlin = ap president is conducting a press conference in Berlin (local time) on January 20. ◇ called minority administration or by-elections, instructions or coalition negotiations, 2017.11.22 a mystery at all, the president is Frank-Walter Steinmeier actually determine the future direction. In this case, Steinmeier first has to appoint the prime minister to avoid a power vacuum, in which Merkel is most likely to be chosen. When Steinmeier appoints Merkel, she must be voted on by Congress to be confirmed as chancellor. Merkel is guaranteed to win the nomination because she can pass the endorsement deal with the most votes, not most. It is then entirely up to Steinmeier to finalize Merkel for prime minister. The president of the House vote within a week after the end of the minority to the prime minister, dissolve parliament and order the administration to decide to conduct new election. If Steinmeier instructs Merkel to enforce minority government, she can't help it. Means they don't want a minority government, Merkel is said, the president commands can be to step down if you can not be accepted by all means. If Merkel steps down, Steinmeier will have to nominate another candidate for prime minister and go through a parliamentary vote again. To date, such a complicated scenario has never been materialized in German politics. ez@newsis.comLee Sang-hyeon, a reporter at the Foreign Ministry in Seoul said, "" The reason for our refusal to enter the U.S. airport is to be confirmed.

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office announced yesterday that it arrested Jeon on charges of accepting bribes, taking bribes, and embezzlement under the Additional Punishment Law on Specific Crimes. Jeon is accused of giving 330 million won in support to the Korea e-Sports Association, which he controlled as chairman and honorary chairman in July 2015. Politicians then raised suspicion of "" turning a blind eye "" to Lotte Home Shopping broadcasting station's review process in April of that year. Prosecutors suspect former senior National Assembly secretary for future creation, science and communication may have decided not to take issue with the re-approving process in return for Lotte Home Shopping's sponsorship. In addition, Jeon is accused of allegedly laundering 110 million won in Lotte's sponsorship money and using it privately, in collusion with Yoon and his former secretary at the time. It is also questionable whether he was involved in paying his former senior secretary and intern about one million won per month as funds for the association's funds. Jeon denied all accusations, saying, There was no irregularity in the process of being summoned by the prosecution as a suspect and questioned for more than 17 hours on July 20.

The United Nations Command requested North Korea to meet to discuss countermeasures on July 22, but it is difficult to expect a proper response.According to the UNC announcement, one out of four North Korean soldiers who were chasing North Korean soldiers at the time briefly crossed the MDL and the North Korean army violated the Armistice Agreement across the MDL by firing back to the south.The UNC reported the fact to the North Korean military at the truce village of Panmunjeom by nurturing it. The ministry also requested North Korea to notify the results of its investigation and to meet with the South to prevent such violations in the future. The North Korean army is filming a scene to notify the UNC.South Korea sent official protest notices to the North on the basis of the results of a military commission investigation and later apologized to the North for its renewed military engagement, according to the ministry.However, since all communication channels between the two Koreas are currently disconnected, it is believed that the UNC orally demanded an apology from the North at Panmunjeom. It is questionable whether North Korea will respond to the UNC's demands for an apology. This is because the UNC and North Korean forces have not held career-level talks since 2009. North Korea has refused a UNC proposal to hold general-level military talks right after the Cheonan was attacked in March 2010.If North Korea does not show up for the conference, it will be difficult for us to apologize for its breach of the armistice, as we have virtually no means of protesting or arguing with the North directly.Until now, no protests have been detected at the Korean government level. They appear to be taking a cautious attitude over concerns that the incident could be a variable in future inter-Korean relations."" It will not be done according to relevant international regulations or legal procedures, "" Unification Ministry spokesman Baek Tae-hyeon told a regular briefing, but this was explained by the UNC's protest.The UNC is waiting for the North's answer. So far, there has been no preparation for North Korea's refusal to comply with the request.Meanwhile, some say that although North Korea has not yet made any response to the defection, it can not rule out the possibility of requesting the defectors to be called criminals."
