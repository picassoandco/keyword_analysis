A fake crime scene photo from Sosa, being decorated by police, capturing a British daily email home page, and a local police officer who received a tape launched an arrest attempt against Lulu.First, Gustavo introduced two police officers to Lulu, his other contract killer. Police then dressed up as if he was shot by applying blood like ink to one side of his head, and then disguised him as a body in a sand hole and took a photograph.Sosa lived in a separate hotel on the outside.Lulu, who received a photo from a police officer who was set up as a contract killer, had a big laugh on the spot. But the laughter was the end. Lulu who asked to kill a husband. Capture the Daily Mail Web site in the U.K.. Lulu, who was caught on a request to kill a husband's contract, pleaded guilty to his guilt. He did so out of malice affined in his financial relationship with his husband.The local court sentenced Lulu to 20 years in jail last October.As the police recently released the photographs of the lying down the hole, it was not long before the public learned what happened.`` It felt like lying in a dirt hole was very terrible, '' Sosa said. `` I did not know that our marriage would end that way. ''▽ Set up a World Daily News Channel for Best Picks (clicked) by reporter Kim Dong-hwan (clicked) and received the prize in Gwangju = The Korea Institute of Animal Health and the Korea Foundation for the Memorial of Cultural Properties was discovered Monday morning in the North Korean Army's wall. ▽ Gwangju : The maximum land where the missing persons were once again suspected of being buried was found in the prison. As more than one drilling operation has already been carried out, along with five pipes that were discovered earlier to be 60-70 cm underground, it is likely to affect the direction of excavation of the rocky burial. The Korea Cultural Properties Research Institute, commissioned by the May 8 Memorial Foundation, has been searching for a burial ground at a former Gwangju prison for three days. The area is three meters long and 10 meters long, and is being divided into four areas (one grid), where the soil is removed by a small amount with a hoe. The first and second pits east of the jail used excavators and shovels to dig up the ground to 1.5 meters. In the process, an unidentified plastic material and three steel pipes were found again. The soil turned black where the pipes were found. We have found black soil, not the yellow one in the background of the discussions, said an official at the Cultural Properties Research Institute. It was confirmed that the five 54 ㎜ piping (4 plastic materials and one steel pipe) discovered on the first day of excavation work were connected to the official residence of the Prison Service. The foundation and researchers confirmed that they are not currently using communication lines and water pipes, and they removed them and continue to dig them up. The pipes are buried outside the walls of the North (Damyang) prison, and are about 117 meters from near the tennis courts to the official residence of the Prison Service. This is where the excavation of the rock burial will be conducted. It is expected that the sale of the rock will have a considerable impact on the direction or outcome of the investigation as the pipes again were discovered underground at a depth of 1m, which was judged to be more likely to be found.▽ New South Korean prison = On the morning of July 8, the National Defense Memorial Foundation and the Korea Cultural Properties Research Institute were also found to have cut down the remains of the bodies in the vicinity of the North Wall of Gwangju Prison in northern Gwangju. Kim Yang-rae, executive director of the Memorial Foundation at hgryu77@newsis.com confirmed yesterday that "" we visited the site with officials who were in charge of the facility in 1980 and found that the remaining pipes were installed, and that more were laid before the prison. "" "" We are in the process of finding the remains of the burial ground based on testimony from three-car officers at the time of May 18th, "" he said. Meanwhile, the foundation secured a document of testimony on May 29, 1995 that Kim, the head of the 3rd Airborne Brigade's main unit, sold 12 bodies with his subordinates and ordered them to be sold to a certain burial site. The document also contained a map of the place of sale. Kim also said, ' I did not use a coffin and buried two bodies in straw bags. ' The foundation believes there are at least six holes. Shortly after May 18, eight bodies were found behind the prison's doors and three bodies were found dead in the middle of a burial ground. The May 31, 1980, fact-finding paper on the incident from the martial law headquarters said 27 civilians (28 data on security forces) were killed in what were called "" prison raids. "" Simple calculations have not confirmed the identity and whereabouts of 16 to 17 people. guggy@newsis.com> relationship and regular checks on Japanese media, such as Donald Trump, Moon Jae-in and president of the United States president to accelerate the report of the seventh day of the summit, traveling between the two heads of state.A close eye on message. Some have been holding back that the Korea-U.S. summit failed to reach a "" honeymoon "" relationship with the U.S. and Japan. 8th niongeijai (Nikkei) Trump, the president, both on a honeymoon during a visit to Japan and South Korea reported that the strong sense of boundaries. And Trump the president of the stay and South Korean media said and come up with differences in this ‘Daewoo’ interpretation. Trump, the president enjoys playing golf with Prime Minister Abe, 3 days in Japan, including, but the itinerary in 2 Days & 1 Night in shorter than him. The presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae explained that it was more than a concession as parliamentary speeches were scheduled, it added. Japanese newspapers that reported the Korea-U.S. summit on the first page of July 8. The Japanese media reported that the two leaders confirmed their alliance, but showed a gap in FTA and dealing with North Korea. The Nikkei also reported that the two countries had a difference over North Korea at the Korea-U.S. summit. Trump the president is in an interview on the eve of fierce criticism on North Korea South Korea to refrain from as consideration for the Nikkei said. But Trump does not rule out military action against the president had pointed out is future relations between the two countries could be the embers of conflict. Nikkei said that the two leaders North Korea's nuclear and missile threats on the response to strengthen ties between Moon Jae-in who are in government they sought, but the United States and China.General review, it's hard to have the same strength and U.S.-Japan relations. The Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun said Trump at a news conference after summit talks with South Korean president is “together” noting several times the word “Korea is a very important countries”.Stressed that he said. Still, like Nikkei, the Korea-U.S. relationship is less than what the U.S. and Japanese leaders declared on July 6 that they would go together 100 percent. Asahi pointed out that South Korea's delicate stance on North Korea is casting a shadow on the relationship between South Korea, the United States and Japan.The newspaper quoted a source saying, "" We can not say that the relationship between Korea and the United States is good, "" and pointed out that this is having a negative influence on the response to North Korea. The U.S., for instance, was reluctant to agree on the need for a nuclear submarine, citing the Korean Defense Ministry's objection. "" It is North Korea that benefits from the loss of aid to South Korea and the United States, "" he said. On the other hand, the Japanese military sexual slavery, and raise the ‘Dokdo,’ damage to Japanese media the Korean government's Eve dinner menu also expressed strong dissatisfaction to a dinner invitation. As it is confirmed that Trump's visit to Korea and Japan is meant to join forces to deal with North Korea, it is believed that the Japanese government is trying to "" throw cold water "" and that South Korean government fears over the issue are groundless.

""Scientists and businesses that develop AI have argued that it is impossible for AI to develop independently in any way with current technology. But Hawking says, "" There could be not only a strong AI weapon that works independently, but also a technology that represses many people as being able to do so, and that the economic system could only be tested enough to collapse. ""It is not the first time that Professor Hawking warned of the dangers of AI. Along with Tesla's CEO, he is considered one of the most famous AI pessimists.

"▽ Opening of self-employment (p.s.Lee, Taeho) _ Less than 5 million won per person out of 10 self-employed people … 52 percent of them will not be paid extra money to work for a private business organization as of August. Analysts say that last year, more and more people were forced to leave their stable jobs in the aftermath of the restructuring and start their own businesses to earn a living. The figures were explained in the May 8, 2017, "" Results of a Non-payable Labor Additional Survey on Economic Activities and Population. "" The survey was conducted in August this year by a non-paid worker from 32,000 households who started his own business within the past two years. When referring to business funds meant for seed money, less than 5 million won was the largest, or 28.3 percent of the total. It was in the order of 5 to 20 million won, 22.0 %, 20,500-500,000,000 won, 500-100,000,000 won, 16.6 %, 100-3,000,000,000 won, and 1.2 % more than 300 million won. In other words, 50.3 percent of the self-employed made up less than 20 million won each, more than half of them. Compared to the previous survey, August 2015, the range of 5 to 20 million won increased by 3.5 %, the highest growth rate. In general, it is recognized that the more money a person has, the higher the expected profit or stability. The results of this year's survey show that small businesses are running their own businesses. The situation has become worse in recent years. If the starting time of small business is shortened from two years to less than one year, the proportion of small business owners will grow to 5,310,000 won and 5,000-200,000 won, respectively. According to the method of raising the seed money, 68.8 percent of the money was raised by themselves or their family, but not a few borrowed money was. Banks, insurance companies and mutual savings and financial companies ranked at 1.4 percent, with 31.5 percent, followed by relatives and partners ' funds, 7.8 percent, 5.0 percent borrowing from others, and government support or support.[Graphic] Only half of the self-employed are industrial account…..That is a slight rise from last years…That means those who have run their own businesses have not yet accumulated capital. The fact that the most difficult part of starting the project was the ' Business Financing ' (28.6 %) was the most important factor to support. Considering that the number of self-employed people without any employees rose 1.3 percent from two years ago, the results of the survey shows that the ratio of self-employed businesses in the era has grown to that extent. More than half (57.4 percent) of those who entered the business were paid workers. It is very possible that he lost his job after earning a stable salary and was forced to work for his own business to make ends meet. 88.9 percent of the respondents said their business was ready for less than a year. In one to three months, 52.0 % were also found to be more than half. The worsening overall conditions, including the size of the business funds, were the effects of an increase in the self-employed without employees, said Vienna Hyun-jun, director of the office`s Employment Statistics Division, who lost their jobs in the shipbuilding industry last year. Other business motives reported were : ' I want to run my own business myself ' with 71.0 % saying ' I can't work as a wage earner, ' and 12.5 % others saying ' I want to work as a wage earner '. The problem is that the prospects are not bright since the self-employed are already saturated. That is the result of analysis on changing businesses while doing other self-employment. The reasons for the trade shift were most often with 36.8 percent of ' to switch to more lucrative businesses. ' The following were due to sluggish business ahead (27.0 %) and no prospect of business ahead (17.0 %). That means the punishment was not good enough. Last month, 39.0 percent of the respondents had been in business for more than five years. It was followed by less than two years (32.2 percent) and four years (28.8 percent) from the previous two years.

"Intermediarism of a 30-something woman, Interpol's Red Wanted to arrest husband, B's first love, and Busan Southern Police Department Police Department said, "" If returned to Korea, it would be possible to investigate whether a married couple was found missing and find out crime. "" A woman in her thirties who is a leading suspect in a honeymoon couple's disappearance from her 15-story apartment building in Busan has been arrested in Norway. According to Busan Southern Police Station, police identified Mr. A as a possible suspect in the incident and are in the process of delivering criminals in cooperation with the Foreign Affairs and Justice Ministry. Upon his return home, the police will question the newlyweds and find out their whereabouts and the suspicion of a crime. A South Korean police officer said, I asked Interpol or the International Criminal Police Agency for a red hunt for a man who left for Norway last June, and was arrested in August. We will seek an arrest warrant for the suspect when he is extradited to Korea. The Busan Newlyweds scandal, which took place in May 2016, was so questionable that SBS television network "" I Want to Know About It, "" dealt with the disappearance of an empty honeycombed couple. Her husband, 35, and his wife, C, who married in November 2015, lived on the 15th floor of an apartment in Suyeong-gu, Busan. The actor's wife, who will be returning home around 10 p.m. on May 27, 2016 and her husband, who will be returning home around 3 a.m. on May 28, was caught on CCTV. After the couple left their apartment, no CCTV footage was taken. The couple's disappearance was a mystery. A CCTV scene shows his wife (left) and husband B returning home from Busan. The father of Mr. B called Mr. B from the morning of the day of his son's disappearance, but he could not reach him. When I went to the store where my son worked, the restaurant business executive just said, I would text him ' I want to take today off today ' in the morning of 28th. At the same time, her fellow actors received a text message from her saying, I can't perform. The fact that he called her by text message instead of by telephone, and the words were not written as usual, led to her being honored, fellow actors testified. As her co-star D repeatedly called her husband on the morning of July 29, he answered the phone instead and hurriedly hung up. The investigation began on June 2, 2016, the sixth day of disappearance, when family members reported their missing to police. Police searched every nook and cranny of the water tank, septic tank, and basement storage area on the roof of the apartment building, hoping to find out whether it had completely damaged a web of CCTVs. The couple had no external signs of invasion and could not find any signs of a fight inside. Only two of the home's cell phones, wallets, identification, passports, and laptops had been lost. As the police tracked the locations of the B couple, her husband's cellular phone signal went off near Busan Gijang County on the day of the report. The signal of his wife's cell phone disappeared near Cheonho-dong in Seoul at 8:00 p.m. The couple's cell phones were cut off at the Seoul and Busan marathons, some 400 kilometers away from each other. At the time, his wife, C, was pregnant. Mr. C was captured as the likely suspect when the police began investigating people around. A is said to be the first love of husband B. It is said that Mr. A married another man in the opposite part of the family, but he kept seeing Mr. B. A divorced person has been harassing the two since B tried to marry C, according to acquaintances to the police. When Mr. B married Mr. C, Mr. A remarried and went to Norway. However, Mr. A said that he kept in touch with Mr. B in Norway, too. B used two cell phones and one was only used to call Mr. A. B ran a salmon tuna restaurant because he recommended selling Norwegian salmon. According to police, the man entered Korea with his husband in mid May 2016 before the incident took place. And the couple headed to Norway in early June, two weeks earlier than scheduled to leave. While staying in Korea for about a month, A never used a credit card at all. According to police polls, A told her mother shortly before she entered Korea that she would travel to Africa and ask for 10 million won in cash. When she came to Korea, not Africa, she did not contact her mother. Police concluded that the "" A "" man was behind the disappearance of the B couple and appointed her as a possible suspect in August 2016. Police used the Internet and telephone to investigate Mr. A in Norway. Then, he hired a lawyer from Norway to respond. However, he disappeared from December 2016 and police asked Interpol for a red warrant last March. Five months later, A was arrested by Norwegian police in August. The Justice Ministry and the Foreign Ministry are in the process of delivering criminals, and the Busan Southern Police Station will investigate when Mr. A is returned to Korea. A policeman at Busan Nambu Police Station said, "" When Mr. and Mrs. A entered Korea and did not even call their family members, they were not willing to leave Norwegian lawyer two weeks earlier than planned. "" However, it does not seem easy to clarify the criminal charges against him. The investigation was not conducted properly right after the disappearance, so we have to rely on Mr. If he fails to prove his alibi before and after the disappearance, we will continue to question him based on the evidence we have obtained so far, said a Busan Southern Police Station official. ▶ lee.eunji2@joongang.co.kr press : Lee Eun Ji, Busan, Korea mobile meet in JoongAng Ilbo [Facebook], cacao, [Plus my friend ] [Mobile web] © 5 Kits combine the JoongAng Ilbo (http://joongang.co.kr) and jtbc content hub of stability, unauthorized war damage and redistribution of Trump, 'Korean spindle chuck' (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) ltd co.Journalist : Donald Trump, the United States president is Bill Clinton in July 1993 and in the morning of November 8, the Assembly Hall after his speech in 24 years after the president the National Assembly and raise one's thumb.to exist jeong@yna.co.kr( : Seoul, Yonhap News Agency) gimbeomhyeon business president said Wednesday parliament and the Korean National Assembly and people through the American Journalist : Donald Trump made special note of thanks.

According to the simple calculation, each Korean person goes on an airplane trip twice a year. Still, the story about airplanes is always new. It is because the delicacy that emphasizes safety and efficiency is hidden. Without explanation, I went through the hidden "" secrets "" of the aircraft, which I was curious about, such as a triangular sticker, a small hole in the cabin window, and a hook to fix the tray. What does the black triangle mean? Small triangle on the wall of the room. Photo Getty already has a black triangle symbol on the side of the window that is right before and after the bank room. People who sit on a triangular seat would care if they didn't know anyone else. But you don't have to worry. Because the marking is for the crew or captain, not for the passengers. Business Insider quoted an expert as saying, "" The best place to check the condition of the wings is in the passenger compartment is in winter. "" The state of ice on the wings is a must see factor for safe driving. In fact, in Canada, many people lost their lives when an airplane crashed several decades ago, trying to take off without removing snow from their wings. There is even a name on the table. The Telegraph, too, quoted a Cuora reply saying, "" One of the episodes of the 1960s TV series Twilight John, "" shows up William Shinere in the seat of 200,000-foot-high nightmare. 2. Why are there small holes in the window? Small hole in the window of the airline cabin. The Getty already has a hole in their bank? Anyone who has looked carefully into the windows of the room would have noticed a small hole at the bottom. Rest easy knowing that this hole is a scientific device for your safety. According to Huffington Post USA, the plane's windows all consist of three clear acrylic panels, with only the middle board. The three plates are used to withstand difference in air pressure inside an airplane, set to an altitude of approximately 1800 meters and the outside. If the three acrylic plates are just overlapped, all three can be broken when there are very rapid changes in the air pressure (explosion in the cabin). However, when there is a hole in the middle panel, air flows through the hole, and the remaining pressure is transferred from the middle plate to the outer plate. In this case, the outer half of the book can be broken and the other two can survive in an emergency. That is why this hole is called the breather hole. It also makes frost or steam least frost. As the plane reaches its cruising altitude, the temperature difference between the cabin and the outside is about 70 degrees. This causes misting or to get frost just like a car. However, air circulates between the air spaces and reduces the temperature difference between the plates, thus preventing water or ice crystals.3. Do you have hangers for the seat of an airplane? A versatile rack in the seat of an airplane. It's quite uncomfortable when the Getty clothes are already worn while traveling on the JessBank. However, one editor of Live Hackers has made a "" landmark discovery "" that some airplanes can use a clamp to secure trays. The fact that some of the trays bars that we didn't pay attention to were made for ' versatile ' purposes, for example, the ones in the picture above. Of course, no one would be upset if I hung my earphone or bag, as well as my clothing.

"" [Click here!] [Money TudeI Yuham Dollars, the latest fashion trend, and the demand for a home mortgage loan market in Myeong-dong increased by three days ago. / Photo : Newsflash 1 saw the biggest increase ever last month with 3.5 trillion won in bank loans and other loans. As consumer demand grows due to the 10-day gold holidays, credit loans from Internet banks such as K-Bank and Kakao Bank continue to grow. Housing transactions declined a lot after the real estate measures were adopted by the government in August, but mortgage loans continued to grow as the central and middle income groups of newly built apartments demanded loans. According to the Bank of Korea (BOK) on October 8, the balance of bank loans (including policy loans) at the end of October was 756 trillion won, up 6.8 trillion won from the end of September. The increase was 1.9 trillion won more than the previous month's 4.1 trillion won increase. It is the highest level this year. The number of credit loans and other loans extended by the sector rose 3.5 trillion won and by 3.3 trillion won, respectively. In particular, the increase in other loans was the highest after the statistics were compiled. It is a hundred billion won increase from the previous record of 3.4 trillion won in August. The figure is 900 billion won higher than the 2.06 trillion won credit card binge in July 2003. The demand for small funds due to the prolonged holiday in early October and continued credit at Internet banks have dramatically increased other lending, said Kim In-koo, head of the central bank`s market division. Net bank credit increased by 800 billion won in October, following the 1 trillion won in September. Kim said, "" The demand for credit loans has increased dramatically since August, and if it is not yet shown to have "" bubble effects "" in real estate measures, it would have been necessary to fill in the shortfall in housing funds at the end of the year. The mortgage loan rate continued to grow despite the decline in the volume of housing transactions. It is because the demand for loans from the underprivised median payment group of apartments is still high. Seoul sales volume of apartments in October stood at 4,000, half of the previous month, according to the ministry. Compared to the August volume of 10,500 units, it was less than one-third. It was explained that the real estate measures were the result of stricter loan regulations and limited sales concessions. For the time being, mortgage loans are expected to be focused on the lending to middle and middle-disciplined conglomerates. In a financial stabilization report released at the end of last year, the central bank estimated that the average monthly mortgage loan demand for apartments by the end of the year was 3 trillion won.As the package includes the cap on collective loans and the guarantee ratio of guarantees among the total household debt announced in October, the size of related loans is expected to decrease gradually, said Nana-in, a central bank`s general manager. Borrowings by banks also increased from last month. At the end of October, the bank loans reached 784.5 trillion won, up 5.6 trillion won from the end of September. The figures for each company's performance amounted to 1.9 trillion won and 3.7 trillion won, respectively. Private business owners (self-employed) accounted for 2.3 trillion won, or 65 percent of the increase in loans from small businesses. Analysts say that lending to real estate, rental, and wholesale and retail sectors is steadily increasing. The amount of loans owed by individual businesses amounted to 284 trillion won, or 45.2 percent of the total loans made by small businesses. Experts point out that the increasing number of self-employed loans, which are not considered statistical household loans, needs to be paid attention and take care of.

"Click here on the Kookmin Daily Web site to view images larger. The same is true of society that has lost its vitality. The gloomy picture of Korean society was revealed through the recognition of the young. He has a desire to make a lot of money, but he refuses to go on an adventure. The dream of middle and high school students is to be public officials, and that of university students is to be employees of public corporations. The sense of community living together also blurred. More and more people are refusing to donate because they are not interested. Still, the welfare demands are strong.■ Rather than challenging, complacency ... What is the dream of the future life of Korean society aged 13 to 29? The most preferred jobs were civil servants and government employees. Few people entered venture businesses or dreamed of starting a business. They claim income and aptitude as criteria for choosing jobs, but in reality, they only seek stability. Even though they work through the eye of a needle, six out of 10 people feel uneasy about losing their jobs or losing their jobs. Anxiety is eating into your hopes. The NSO said in a survey of 39,000 people aged 13 and over nationwide, the most important criterion in choosing a job was income (39.1 percent) on July 7. The results were followed by stability (27.1 percent) and fitness (17.1 percent). However, students of middle and high schools put priority on aptitude and interest over income. The NSO does an annual social survey and selects five areas, which this year were welfare, social participation, cultural and leisure, income and consumption, and labor (job recognition). There was a huge gap between the job search and the job recognition they wanted. The number of jobs that young people want to work at is the national institution (254 percent). The second place was public enterprises (19.9 percent). As for middle and high school students who set the standard of aptitude and interest as the most important criterion, the survey results showed that the government agencies were the most likely to work. Those who were admitted to universities or higher preferred public institutions (24.9 percent) to state-run (23.7 percent). The income is larger than that of government employees, and the job security is similar to that of civil servants. On the other hand, only 2.9 percent of the respondents said they would like venture companies or 3.7 percent said they would take a chance. Only 7 to 8 percent of middle and high school and university students prefer to start businesses. They are also found to suffer anxiety even after successful job. 60.4 percent of the respondents said they lost or had to leave their jobs, feeling uneasy about them. Men were more anxious than women. By age group, anxiety was highest among those in their 30s and 40s. The notion that work is more important than family members is getting weaker ; 43.1 percent of those surveyed said ' work first. ' It was 10.6 percent less than the survey two years ago. The childcare burden topped the list of barriers to women's work. People in their 30s picked childcare center and kindergarten as the most important public facilities to increase.Sejong : New Jun-seop journalist Shin Joon-seop : "" People are Hard-looking. "" The reason for the donation is that the people's pocket is getting better. Compared to two years ago, more people are content with their current income. The financial strength of the two countries has also increased the number of elderly people who live away from their children. However, the donations are going backwards. People are neglecting donations not because they have no money, but because they are indifferent to donations. They have become less considerate of the underprivileged and more considerate of the community. The words ' generous from the barn ' have become a real clearshoot. According to the social survey of 2017, released on July 7 by the National Statistical Office, 82.1 percent of people over the age of 19 are classified as those who have income. It was up 3.6 percent from the previous survey conducted two years ago (78.5 percent). The poll found that 30,4837 respondents over the age of 19 were surveyed. Out of those earning income, 13.3 percent of them are satisfied with their current income, up 1.9 percent from two years ago. On the other hand, those who were dissatisfied with their income decreased from 46.3 percent to 46.0 percent. People who answered their current income levels were average made up 40.7 percent. As the satisfaction level of income has increased, so has the satisfaction of life in consumption. About 15.4 percent of the respondents said they were satisfied with the overall consumption, including leisure time and hobbies. It is a 1.5 percent increase from two years ago. The situation has also changed for the elderly, who are over 60 years old and live apart from their children. As many as 31.4 percent said they can live independently and live apart. More than 29.4 percent answered, "" It is easier to live apart. "" A lot of people said that two years ago, it was convenient to live apart. Although the income situation has become relatively better, sharing with your neighbors is becoming less and less visible. Out of the 39,000 people surveyed, only 26.7 percent of them donated during the past year. When surveyed in 2011, 36.4 percent answered that they had donated. It has decreased by nearly 10 percent in six years. More serious is the reason for not giving. The answer to the lack of money decreased from the survey two years ago, but the answer to this question has increased dramatically. Instead of sharing them, welfare demands are high. Asked about the overall living conditions, such as health care and services, 58.8 percent answered that they were "" unchanged "" or worse. Among them, 16.6 percent answered that they got worse from age 30 to 39.Sejong : Increasing the Self-indulgence of a Seong-Sin : After a car accident, the black box was taken off and the victim was seriously injured in revenge driving, so the victim's black box was taken off to conceal her revenge driving. Men who have lived for years as patients of schizophrenia to avoid military service were also arrested. It is a selfish and stark picture of life. Police in Chilgok, North Gyeongsang Province, requested an arrest warrant for a 56-year-old man who attempted to destroy evidence after reversing his opponent's car by driving in revenge. A was immediately driven by a tunnel near the main highway when a following vehicle sped past his foreign car two or three times to pass, police said. After following the heavy braking, he turned to the side of the road, but the car collided with a concrete retaining wall to avoid the same direction. When the seriously injured man was taken to the hospital, a neighbor reported the black box of a car with the accident scene on it as a cover of revenge, and threw it into a nearby grass. Police, however, found out that the car was involved in revenge driving after thorough investigations, questioning the description of the car and the collision between the two. So far, Mr. A has denied the crime. After searching several times for the black box that he dumped, police concluded that the crime was called for. We plan to arrest Mr A for his possible destruction of evidence, including the destruction of black boxes on damaged vehicles even though retaliated driving on the highway would have led to a major disaster, police said. In Busan, police arrested a 30-something man who had been carefully postponed his military service. Busan Southern Police Station announced yesterday that it arrested an aunt (31) on suspicion of exemption from military service with fake documents. Lee was declared eligible to join the army in November 2005, but has continued to delay his enlistment. After receiving various information and receiving two years of treatment by imitating patients with schizophrenia, he received a medical certificate of schizophrenia from the hospital psychiatrist in October 2011 and was exempted from military service in April 2012. When diagnosed with schizophrenia in the hospital, Lee had an intelligence quotient of 53, but after dodging military service, Lee led a normal social life working as an import car salesman or a journalist for a small media company. Lee`s crime was revealed while being reintested by the hospital to regain a driver's license cancelled due to diagnosis of schizophrenia. When Lee's intelligence index was at 114, a hospital official who suspected of being involved in the crime reported it to the police.

"The number of people who took part in the posting against Cho Doo-soon's release from prison on the presidential office`s petition hit 200,000 on July 7. The number of people who agree to the petition against Cho Doo-soon, which was posted on the presidential office`s Web site's public petition board, surpassed 200,000 on July 7. Cho was previously convicted of brutally assaulting an eight-year-old and sentenced to 12 years in jail in 2008. Prosecutors at the time tried to seek jail time, but the court ruled that Cho was mentally and physically weak, drunk and unable to make a rational decision, and received a public verdict of 12 years. The petition was registered on September 6. In the petition, the petition proposal said, "" We should review it to prevent Cho from being released from prison. "" Netizens said in unison, We should protect the nation from the underage victim. The sentence is too small for the crime. It is the third time that more than 200,000 of the postings on the National petition board have been passed since the abolition of the Boy Act and the petition against abortion laws. Cheong Wa Dae requires responsible officials, including the presidential chief of staff or ministers of ministries, to reply to a petition that has been recommended by more than 200,000 people within 30 days. As Cho Doo-soon's release from prison is nearly three years away, social networking services are raising calls for his review. However, experts say that the current law has little possibility of a new trial. Under the constitution, a second trial is allowed only on the precondition that the convicted criminal found new evidence, witnesses, and others guilty. Especially, the principle of ` one tax payment principle `, in which punishment can not be reinvested, prevents a person from reviewing a sentence when he or she is released from prison as Cho Du-soon. They have already paid for their crimes. Politicians are pointing out the need for a separate system improvement. If the review is impossible, we should enact a government system to prevent future dangers, such as possible security measures, said Pyo Chang-won, a fisherman's lawmaker.

"As the number of applicants remained high despite stricter regulations on subscription but the high rate of competition in Seoul has not decreased, the number of newly built apartments for the homeless has increased. As the number of apartments for the low-income bracket has increased, the number of applicants and young people who want to buy apartments has increased. The photo shows a second sample house built by Doosan Weve, North Korea. A 48 - worker, who lives in Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, took out a subscription book he had put in a closet for 10 years last month and bought a new apartment. When housing prices were soaring in the early 2000s, he was a novice in society and was not interested in real estate. After the 2008 financial crisis, the housing market had declined and people could not afford to buy homes. Apartment prices started to rise again after 2014, but I turned around rental houses because I felt my future was uncertain. He now says he wants to rent a new apartment because he thinks he can t miss the chance to get the ' cream of the crop '. The market has opened for the homeless, so we can`t keep a watchful eye on the price-and-location complex, Kim said. After the government's August 2 real estate policy raised the subscription threshold, homeless people are pouring into the market. The increase in the price of a house was due to the increase in the price of a house amid the high possibility of winning the house owners. The government`s tougher regulations on the housing market, including restrictions on loans since next year, have been pushing home owners to subscribe. As the volume of homeless has more than doubled, the number of eligible people who are eligible to subscribe to apartments in 40 regions nationwide, including Seoul, has increased to more than two years from the previous registration period. In overheated speculation zones, the subscription price system for the homeless widened from 85 ㎡ or less to 100 percent. As the number of first graders has increased, the number of first graders has decreased dramatically. According to the Korea Financial Telecommunications and Information Service, the number of Seoul residents who subscribed to home savings dropped from 30.9 million at the end of August to 2.37 million at the end of September, down 23 percent or 700,000. One out of every four people who took first place lost their license. However, although the number of applicants decreased and the number of applicants has narrowed, the competition rate is still very high. Godeok Artheon, a reconstruction complex in Godeok, Gangdong-gu, had a competition rate of 10.5 to 1 early this month. Godeok Central I-Park, the new construction site of Godeok 5, had half its competition rate of 23.6 to 1 in July, but its subscribers do not differ much. The number of people who visit Godeok Central I-Park is 12,000, and that of Godeok Artheon is 11,000. It is estimated that the Gajeong-ri Central I Park in Godeok's central park is subscribed to a substantial number of residents since 40 percent of the apartments were built on 85 ㎡ or less. On the other hand, the subscribers to Godeok Arteon did not have a chance to win the bid, so they did not have any. By the standards of homeless, competition for subscriptions has become fiercer. Even when the number of applications for eligible voters decreases, the competition rate is high in Gajaeul New Town, Seodaemun District, Seoul. Early August, the company`s Echo competition was 19.8-1, and last month, the subscribers were even higher on the DMC, as the general sales volume of the Raemian DMC Rusentia was similar to that of similar units. As usual, the rate of homeless households has increased. The same is true of redevelopment projects in Eungam-dong, Eunpyeong-gu. Baengnyeonsan SK Buyee Park was five or six to one in March, but its slightly lagging brand name Haemoro Baengnyeonsan experienced higher competition on July and May. As a result of the application process, the ‘ raid ’ on the sales market by the housemarker was started after the measures adopted in the previous 8-2. This is because the residential district has been designated as a speculation zone and the system of provisional registration has expanded since August 3. SK Reader's View in Gongdeok-dong, Mapo-gu, Sinbanpo Central Xi, and Raemian Forest in Gaepo-dong, Gangnam-gu recorded sales rates in the past. As the volume of luxury goods increases due to the high price of medicine cut lines, the price of luxury goods increases dramatically, however, the price of gifts for winning prizes is likely to fall. As the competition grows stronger, there is little difference. Before and after the opening of the provisional system, the average solution price of winners in Gajaeul Newtown DMC and Raemian DMC Rusentia was 50-61. Of course, the new wholesale market saw an increase in prices of apartments (44-62 points). Even before the low price point system, however, a good score was enough to win the game. Many of the recently increased houseless subscribers have the highest chance of winning in the past. So even though the door is wide open, the cut lines do not go down significantly. What else is it that made the homeless go out on the hunt for a new apartment? How do you apply the subscription price system? If DSR is implemented, the limit on loans will be greatly decreased, and the loan regulations, which are to be tightened after next year, are speeding up the subscription process. Starting January next year, the existing DTI (total debt payment ratio) will become more tenacious and the DSR (total repayment ability audit) will be introduced. This not only determines mortgage loans but also debt and equity funds by combining them. Though it does not matter if one does not owe anything else, the amount of one's home mortgage will decrease significantly if one has a credit loan. As of last year, the average household debt was 66 million won. If the annual income of 50 million won does not include other debts such as credit loans, the traditional DTI of Seoul can apply for loans by up to 340 million won. As the mortgage loan rate in Seoul is 50 percent, the building price can be up to 680 million won. However, the maximum amount of loans that DSR can offer is 280 million won. It will decrease 60 million won. It will be reduced by 120 million won. In terms of the size of housing, the number of houses available for sale will decrease by 20 ㎡. In case of newly built apartments, DSR applies to the remaining loans while registering their owners ' rights to move in. Since the apartments will be the first complex to announce the recruitment of new residents after DSR's implementation, it is better to receive sales tax before issuing other loans. Hey`s been busy with loan restrictions due to the many popular reconstruction and redevelopment apartments, but now it is receiving a flood of popular apartments in the area. Housing construction companies and redevelopment organizations are rushing to sell their cars to avoid stronger regulations. According to Property 114, the volume of apartments to be sold by the beginning of this month amounts to 40,000, the largest amount since 2000, including those scheduled to be sold by the end of this year. Ham Young-jin, director of the Real Estate 114 Research Center, said, The volume of regeneration and the rising housing costs to avoid the reviving profit next year have dramatically increased in the redevelopment of Gangbuk New Town, which has become a part of the project. As the reconstruction and redevelopment complex has high brand awareness and good infrastructure, it leads the market for apartments with high subscription rates. There are also concerns that the volume of sales will decrease after next year when various regulations are put into effect. The reaction of the homeowner's alienation during the recent two to three years of raising house prices also excites the homeless. Since 2015, when housing prices in Seoul have risen significantly, the owners have used their rental deposits to buy houses with gap investment, which is designed to make profit. The proportion of housing purchases by the residents who bought houses by the host country increased by nearly 50 % from less than 40 % in the early 2010. Hey`s new apartment price and cheap new apartments will not be able to be sold until they are put on the market because of tougher sales limitations. Homeless people say that the cheaper prices do not make the price fall as a result. The HUG is pressuring the public to increase the price of apartments by guaranteeing sales, and businesses are reluctant to raise prices to increase the initial contract rate. Apartment sales prices in Seoul were 1.68 million won per 3.3 ㎡ in September, a price lower than existing apartments (21.08 million won). Apartment prices have risen by 5.3 % over the past year, while prices of apartments to be built by 3.6 % during the same period. The sale price of Rodok Artion in the Godeok district of Gangdong-gu, which was subscribed to at the beginning of the month, is 23.46 million won per 3.3 ㎡, no different from the nearby Godeok Gracium (23.38 million won) that was offered a year ago. Apartment prices in Gangdong-gu rose 6 percent during the period. If the price of new apartments is below the current rate, it is about 10 percent cheaper than the premium, said Huh Yoon-kyung, a researcher at the Construction and Economy Research Institute of Korea. As there were no seats available for residents in their 20s or 30s who could not afford to stay in the market, people were forced to leave their homes. The massive influx of wealthy house-holders in the subscription market has nearly eliminated the chance of winning among those in their 20s and 30s, who have relatively low scores. That is because they have a short period of time to sign up for a home and subscription book and have few dependents. Among the winners of the Gajaeul Newtown DMC, people in their 20s and 30s accounted for 53 percent of the total number of participants in August, beating people in their 40s (26 percent). In the Raemian DMC Rucentia, where the system was expanded to 100 percent two months later, 40 was doubled to 51 percent, and the percentage of those in their 20s and 30s fell to 28 percent. Even in the dream picture of Yeongdeungpo New Town, Yeongdeungpo-gu last month, the highest percentage of winners was in their 40s (47 percent), which is nearly half. Lee Wol-mu, head of a sales agency said, "" It takes 40 points to win a decent apartment with a provisional payment, but it is virtually impossible to say that the length of your homeless is less than 10 years. "" Because of this, it is difficult to go beyond the threshold of a family store in their 20s or 30s that recently married people are changing their subscription strategy to a newly married couple with a special offer in favor of the system. Even if a person misses a special offer, he or she will still be given another chance to win the general offer. A newly married woman who had failed to make it before her marriage."
"As the competition for special supply for wealthy individuals has increased, Godeortion Artheons is losing ground even for its 1.91 to 1 host country. They say, "" Those who are excluded from the system will have to tap the doors of those who are over 85 ㎡ in size. As 50 percent of them are drawn, they can expect to win more than 85 ㎡ or smaller. Among apartments built in Seoul since October, the average competition rate for apartments under 85 ㎡ was 9.2 to 1, with the number of apartments exceeding 85 ㎡ being 7.9 to 1. In the past, the competition rate for medium to large businesses was significantly lower. Among medium to large size houses, people are expected to demand more housing around 100 ㎡, where the price of houses is not much different from the size of small to middle-sized apartments. The subscription has become very complicated due to limitations on the subscription loan restriction, said Park Won-gab, a real estate advisor at Kookmin Bank`s WM Star Advisory Board, taking into consideration the financial viability of winning.

"A vehicle is passing through a pedestrian threatening intersection between the island and India at the intersection of ▲ Seoul's Jongdae-daero district. One pedestrian has not even crossed the pedestrian crossing yet, and the others are waiting. Byun Young-wook, journalist Cut @donga.com, was less than five meters away. Without slowing down, a right hand city bus made a ' rush ' at two women as they crossed the sidewalk towards the traffic island. Because of its centrifugal force, the bus ran mostly curved on its left. The astonished women scurried back to the sidewalk. This happened on July 31 at the intersection of Sejong-daero, Jongno-gu, Seoul. You can see the same scene three or four times an hour from here. A traffic island is a common traffic safety facility at an intersection. Pedestrians wait here for the signal. There is a clear crossing between the traffic island and India. In reality, however, they can not be treated as a crosswalk. Vehicles are more important than pedestrians.○ The traffic island is in the same situation as the intersection of Eulji-ro 1-ga Station (Subway Line No. 2). It has the highest bus traffic in Seoul. Most buses from Gwanghwamun to Seoul Station go through Gangnam and southern Gyeonggi Province. It is the seventh round trip and the 8th round trip to the north. Traffic is convenient. Pedestrians, however, are dangerous. At around 1:00 p.m. on July 1 in front of Exit 7 and 8 of Euljiro 1-ga Station (Seoul), no vehicle was slowed down in front of a pedestrian crossing between the transportation island and the sidewalk. The same was true of the people on the sidewalk. Kim Ha-young (31, female), who pushed the stroller with her two-year-old son, stared at the right turn. Eventually, pedestrians must cross the road with their lives at stake, Kim said. The island has been set up to improve the transportation system since 1988. However, there was no clear criteria. Seoul City has 2.6 traffic islands per intersection in comparison to the world`s major metropolitan highways, according to the Studies Institute last year. That is twice that of Tokyo (1.3) or London (1.2). The study found that the island is only effective when its pedestrian traffic is less than 800 per hour and the right turn traffic is more than 260 per hour, said Kim Won-ho, director of the transportation system at the Seoul Institute of Research.○ Turning red light on the right is illegal? Legal? (pedestrian crossing is green light). Allowing for a right is also a traffic system that focuses on traffic rather than pedestrians. The only countries in the world that allow RTOR are South Korea, the United States and Canada. International standards do not allow a red light to turn right. An empty agreement on road signs and traffic signs in 1968 ruled out vehicles in the event of a comprehensively red light. Currently, 56 countries, including 33 European countries, comply with the agreement, and most other countries follow it. The United States has several pedestrian protection devices in place. Do not turn right in a child protection area or an accident area with red lights as an exception. There is also a right hand traffic light. Most of all, the vehicle must stop in front of a pedestrian crossing, even if turning right is possible. South Korea is not obliged to pause on a red light. The regulations on road traffic laws involved are also vague. According to the National Police Agency, pedestrians will stop when they turn right when they cross a pedestrian crossing and will not be cracked down when there are no pedestrians or when they pass sufficiently. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court ruled in its 2011 walking signal that turning right to the right was illegal. The rules that apply in the event of a right turn accident also depend on the circumstances, such as a violation of signals in the middle class and a ban on safe driving under normal error, said Lim Chae-hong, director of the Samsung Traffic Safety & Culture Institute. Once we turn right, we will revise the road traffic law to make sure we stop at the crosswalk without fail, and gradually move the facilities to cover the driver's view when we turn right, police said.Jeong Seong-taek, Seo Hyeong-seok, neone@donga.com Choi Hyeon-sil (age : Choi Hyeon-seop, a former prosecutor of the Seoul Prosecutors ' Office, was charged with accepting 1.6 billion won in funding from Samsung Group's genius center in 2017.06.29.

"▽ Draughts = [1] The corporate governance structure should be shaken. Although the bank's record performance is high, it is estimated that its stock prices are now at 7 % lower as a risk. Earlier, Woori Bank reported a record performance in the first three quarters of this year, surpassing its previous earnings figures of last year. Still, stock price fluctuations reflect the "" CEO's (CEO's) risks "" surrounding the fate of the next CEO. As the uncertainty of governance has become a growing problem, it has caused a flood of sales, especially for foreigners, said an analyst at a securities bank.The bank`s risk for CEOs was sparked by the fact that Chairman Lee's resignation was immediately met with a "" public draft. "" After the state-run Korea Deposit Insurance Corp. privatized its 29.7 percent stake at the end of last year to sell to seven oligopolistic shareholders, the government said it would not intervene in appointing Woori Bank head. We will exclude the forecast from the top priority of Woori Bank president, the government said at the time. But as the regime changes, financial authorities are considering `` changing the situation, '' and `` resolving the growing tension in the past, '' adding, "" the reason for the government's swift financial stability, '' is to blame.◇ KB, 4 CEOs in 9 years, and JP Morgan said that Woori Bank, which has almost no forecast shares in the top four financial institutions including KB Financial Group, Shinhan Financial Group, Hana Financial Group and Woori Bank, has 18.5 % forecast shares. However, the so-called government risks of switching CEOs to meet the government`s demands at every change of power are undermining their competitiveness.The draft-stricken CEO of a local financial firm has a very short tenure compared to advanced financial institutions. KB Financial Group has had four CEOs for nine years since its inception in 2008. KB Financial Group has shown an ugly attitude, causing a "" self-depression "" while the chairman and the bank chief, who came down on separate lines, clashed. Former KB Chairman Lim Young-rok and former KB Chairman Lee Geon-ho resigned in 2014 after being attacked by the Financial Supervisory Service while arguing over whether to replace the main computer maker. Woori Finance (now Woori Bank), which was launched as the nation's first financial holding company in 2001, has had its six heads replaced over the past 16 years. The argument continued as the chairman and the president came down with different ropes. A financial figure has been quoted as saying, "" If you meet financial authorities recently, you are saying, ' No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, based on long-term Korean CEO.Jamie Diman of JP Morgan, the nation`s largest financial services company, and Lloyd Blankfield of leading investment bank Goldman Sachs, have each held the chairmanship for about 12 years. The chairman of the former CEO of Welspago, John Stump, has been in office for more than nine years since the current CEO began his term.It is easy to see how much of the governance structure of the nation`s financial groups is exposed to management risks. Citibank Korea, which has not received any influence from financial authorities, held the post of bank president for 14 years with its former chairman Ha Young-koo (current president of the Korea Federation of Banks) being re-elected.◇ In the process of appointing a CEO, the problem is not that the domestic financial CEO's tenure is short, but that it will not be possible to replace him due to the fact that he or she is a clear successor.Woori Bank is dealing with the instability of its business by taking over its management by taking over the business sector and the global group head Sohn Tae-seung after the bank`s announcement. However, some say that if the government's personnel intervention is visible, it could lead to a practice of setting lines to powerful figures. It also points out that the financial authorities should not make a long break by allowing existing management to resign, and then suddenly make an attempt to send in a parachute greetings like KB Financial Company.Experts say that the nation's financial institutions need to restructure governance structures that are shaky in order to remain competitive. "" At the end of the day, the role of the executive recommendation committee (made up of outside directors) was important and the board of directors delegated to them should be able to fend off the parachute candidate, "" said Lee Si-yeon, an economist at the Financial Research Institute.The Financial Company's Governance Act, which has been in effect since August last year, requires financial companies to ensure continuity in management by preparing in advance succession procedures for their successors. However, the financial circle says this is not enough to block external influence in the process of appointing a CEO. Because of the nature of the state-run financial firm, it is hard to be free from the influence, said Yoon Chang-hyun, a professor of business administration at the University of Seoul, as key shareholders said during the Shinhan case in the past.

On the other hand, the dependence of insurance companies on independent insurance agents (GA), which is loose, increases rapidly, and it is feared that it will harm consumers by selling out of order.According to the Financial Statistics Information System of the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) on July 8, the number of life insurers exclusively for life insurers has decreased sharply over the past five years. The number of full-time designers who received jobs decreased steadily to 136,000 in 2013, 123,000 in 2014, and 117,000 in 2015, but reached the 100,000 mark in August this year. Life insurance companies have shown that they have cut down on their hiring to prepare for the regular work of insurance planners ▷ IFRS17.Conversely, the dependence on GA increased. GA's share of premium payment window jumped from 23.4 percent in 2013 to 27.8 percent in June this year. The number of design engineers at GA increased from 181,000 in 2014 to 198,000 in 2015 and 208,000 last year.The problem is that the lack of control over the insurance companies in the GA business could lead to the occurrence of unhealthy business activities. According to Article 102 of the Insurance Business Act, insurance companies that have "" taken considerable precautions "" while entrusted to their agents for subscription are not liable for damages caused by Contractor. Industry experts explain that GA's design and operation of internal control or education system is often "" profit-oriented. ""In fact, the Life Insurance Association's report on the comparative disclosure of incomplete sales during the first half of the year showed that the average rate of incomplete sales in GA was 0.3 %, which is nearly twice the average rate of all designers who sell it. A continued reliance on current full-time designers to leave and GA's will result in increased consumer damages in the future. As the commission ratio of GA's import insurance fee (15.7 percent) is far higher than that of the designated designer (9.5 percent), life insurers will have to pay more for their business.We are closely watching the tendency of life insurers for profit or incomplete sales, as they show signs of deferring themselves, a financial official said.yesyep@heraldcorp.com"
""" People's Daily in Busan Limited Edition, Busan's Animal Zone, 5 or Less Dogs Should Be Constrained "" - After the recent opening of a famous restaurant owner's store in the aftermath of the photo Getty image bank, some local governments have pushed for a ban on smoking, limiting the number of dogs and requiring people to wear their mouths to wear them. Busan district announced on July 30 that it would propose an ordinance limiting the number of dogs to five per household. Gyeonggi Province announced on July 5 that it planned to revise the ordinance such as the restriction of the entrance requirements for dogs who wear a mouth guard when they went out of the house by more than 15kg. Busanjin-gu has announced legislation limiting the number of domestic animals allowed to be raised in restricted areas to five pet owners and two security animals. In Busan, the most densely populated district, the entire area is included in the livestock rearing restriction zone according to the law on the management and use of livestock dung. The bill was promoted with collective complaints from residents in Buam-dong, Busanjin-gu, Busan behind it. A resident of Buam-dong raised more than 30 dogs, creating a conflict between the residents of Gyeonju and the village. Residents of the emergency committee submitted a collective petition to the district to stop dogs from being bred with more than 300 signatures. It is not only the residents but also the animals ` pain to raise more than 30 animals in the homes, said Seok Kwang-jun of Freedom Korea Party, who proposed the ordinance. In addition, we have prepared a bill to settle the problem because of a constant row between the owners of pets and the others, the statement said. Even if the bill is revised, however, it is uncertain how many households can be affected by it. It is difficult to keep track of the situation because the animal registration system has not been properly implemented, said Rep. Meanwhile, Lee Hyung-joo, director of the Institute for Animal Welfare, said, "" The direction of the act is wrong. "" The Act was based on the Law on Cardamom, which includes dogs, cattle, pigs, and ducks, but argued that pets should not be included in livestock because they were not initially bred for profit purposes. Lee explained that the problem of ` Bouam-dong 35 dogs ` as the basis of the bill's motion is typical ` Animal Hording ` (the practice of breeding too many animals in a small space). He said, "" In order to solve the problem, the discussion should be made under the Animal Health Act, not under the law on livestock dung. One is putting a muzzle on. Meanwhile, the "" anti-bullying dog safety measures "" announced by Gyeonggi Province on May 5 is also under controversy. Gyeonggi Province announced on October 31-11 that it would revise its public opinion poll of 1,000 residents (Korean research team, men and women in their 20s and 60s, errors in sampling, and a mandatory assessment by residents ' association of more than ± 3.1 kg of reliability). The online bulletin board of Cheong Wa Dae is filled with voices of opponents. There is nothing to aggression and weight, said Anti-Consultancy who proposed the petition. Even when implemented, it is difficult to conduct an on-site weight measurement right away, making it unrealistic. In addition, the injured person was requested to receive personnel from the public work force to monitor etiquette and impose fines when they were injured in the event of an injury, such as implementation of the Gaera Mandatory Registration System (Gatda). As of November 8, more than 15,000 citizens had agreed to the petition. Regarding this, an official at the animal protection and animal protection team in Gyeonggi Province said, The 15-kilogram standard is for large dogs from 15 kilograms, and people felt that dogs with large dogs should have a sense of security. As for the 2-meter leash, we refer to 1.8 meters limits in some U.S. states. When the trouble broke out, he decided it was the right way to take control. However, we don`t impose a 2m limit at all places, and we plan to specify according to the circumstances, which are a little longer in larger parks and shorter in elevators. "" The revision is not final, but it will be implemented by next spring to accommodate public opinion and to reflect the revision to the National Assembly's animal protection law, "" an official said. Cho Hee-kyung, head of the Animals Freedom Federation, said, "" If dogs are required based on their weight, they can make people feel better by wearing them, even when they can be seen naturally. "" "" Dogs with fighting personalities, in the process of genetically upgrading, have to have more aggressive breeds. "" Social Security education should set standards for dogs, and dogs are bred in captivity.

"MBC President Kim Jang-gyeum steps out of the way Thursday morning when unionists at MBC's MBC's Board of Radio Culture (visiting staff) visited the office in Seoul. November 8, 1717.11.8 / News 1 / Hwang Ki-seon (1892-1908) I was about to attend the Board of Directors on July 8, but I urge you to turn around and follow the written substitution of the Public Communications Act and Procedures of the President of MBC. Kim said in a statement sent to the Korea Broadcasting and Culture Promotion Association, which owns MBC, "" We have been talking about the reasons for dismissal and dismissal of MBC President and have violated the Constitution, the broadcasting companies ` management laws and regulations so far. "" Kim was originally scheduled to attend a meeting of directors to deal with his dismissal proposal and explain his attitude and personal feelings to the directors. He was about to attend the board meeting to be held at 10:00 a.m., but was surrounded by dozens of members of MBC, the Korean Media Workers Union, and was unable to attend due to physical reasons. Instead, Kim Jang-kyum submitted an 11-page written explanation to the visiting team's board. In a statement, Kim Jang-kyum, president of MBC, claimed to have acted appropriately as head of MBC, while explaining various controversies surrounding him. First, he argued that he would give the production autonomy to maintain neutrality and independence of broadcasting and ensure fairness and objectivity, while faithfully monitoring and criticizing functions of the media for information delivery and power. The broadcasting law, however, dismissed the claim of undermining the fairness and public interest of broadcasting, saying, We believe we have done our best as a journalist for more than 30 years, and dismissed the grounds for the measures that set forth above, and dismissed the grounds of fairness that it. Regarding the allegation that MBC was designed to make the broadcast by the government, Kim also said, We have strived to ensure objective and balanced news, and it is impossible to accept a categorical argument that the government is the trumpeter. In addition, he avoided the debate over the violation of human rights due to the suppression of MBC's union members and improper cables, saying, "" It was before he took office as the CEO. "" Rather, Kim Jang-kyum insisted, Despite the media conglomerate`s cowardly and threatening castles and scuffles during the general strike, proudly went to the front gate every day to fulfill his duty as a president. Finally, I don`t think the argument is relevant or very emotional or subjective before being appointed as president, which is why I don`t agree to fire him. Meanwhile, the visiting team held a meeting again at 5pm on July 10 to deal with the absence of Kim Jang-kyum, and due to the business trips of the three opposition directors, including Kim Kwang-dong, Kwon Hyuk-cheol and Lee In-cheol, respectively, to resign from the board. Lee Wan-key, chairman of the broadcasting company, said, "" It is an urgent matter for the nation to suspend its publication, as many directors have violated MBC's economic losses, the rights to know, and the right to view, and thus should resolve the issues as soon as possible. "" Korean Broadcasting Culture Promotion Association (Staff) on July 8, 2017 in front of the visiting staff of Yeouido, Seoul, urged the resignation of MBC president Kim Jang-kyum. The board of directors was supposed to deal with Kim`s dismissal proposal, but it was postponed until July 10 when union members protested against it. 2017.11.8 / News 1 ¹ News 1 Hwang Ki-seon Sho 218 ▶ @, News & Photo View on Pyeongchang 2018. Since construction of a nuclear submarine takes at least five to seven years, the first phase of the process is to fill a power vacuum against the North's underwater threat, and to obtain operational technology for a nuclear submarine, at least one vessel is considered efficient. Pyongyang is insisting on a special measure to fill in the underwater power vacuum amid persistent intelligence that it is building a new submarine with three to four SLBM vertical launch tubes. Some in and outside the military said, "" We should consider purchasing three LA submarines, each of which is undergoing retirement. "" Considering the submarine depot maintenance period, two ships should be operated even if one begins repair. The U.S. Navy is shifting its focus from the Los Angeles level to the Virginia level. Experts estimate that the cost of the LA rating would be much lower than that of the two trillion won per day when it was built, since the company is undergoing retirement procedures. In particular, since the Tomahok cruise missiles can carry 150 kt of jeonsul80, it is analyzed that there will be considerable deterrence against North Korea if it is introduced at least once. One expert said on July 8, "" I've purchased at least one LA submarine and learned how to operate a nuclear submarine in the U.S. The most effective way to finance it would be to build a nuclear submarine domestically. "" A senior presidential official also said at the Korea-U.S. summit the day before regarding the acquisition and development of high-tech strategic assets, "" There are also parts of nuclear powered submarines and cutting-edge reconnaissance assets. "" When asked whether ' nuclear powered submarines and reconnaissance satellites are acquired and developed, ' he explained, ' They are both. ' In other words, it is interpreted as saying that both purchase and development are possible. However, some argue that the impact on the Korean defense industry and the nuclear plant industry should be carefully debated if nuclear submarines were purchased directly from the U.S. Regarding the capability required to operate a nuclear submarine, the military and outside are expected to build six nuclear facilities with a displacement of 4,000 tons. The Joint Chiefs of Staff has yet to determine the ROC of the nuclear submarines, but some submarine experts say the nation's underwater location suggests an appropriate level of 4,000 tons or six. - North Korea's SLBM [Combined News Photo] shows that South Korea's shipbuilding industry and nuclear plant industries have little ripple effect because of the reduction in the amount built locally if 1 to 3 ships are purchased in the U.S. In addition, some point out that the U.S. has fully protected nuclear submarines and submarine technologies with the items it can purchase them easily. "" Even if we purchase used nuclear submarines directly, our running and maintenance costs would be huge, "" a military official said. `` Because the country has enough technology to develop small reactors, it is possible to ask for cooperation from the U.S. If the U.S. proposes to sell nuclear submarines next year, we need to consider buying them and reducing the risks of developing them immediately, said Moon Keun-sik, director of the Korea Institute of Defense Security.

"Tell them to get along with the business people and stay close to them. It is hard to confirm the anonymity of universities. (Yonhap news agency) Jang Young-eun (Ulsan = University of Science and Technology) said that she had her professor's article sent to a social networking service center. Facebook, which is associated with a university in Ulsan, recently had a long article that began with the message : I experienced it firsthand with my professor. The writer, who is a female university student, called in Seoul during the vacation to ask for a meal with a high-ranking official of a company that would help her land a job, and insisted that the professor arrange a support date at a dinner table. The writer said, "" The bosses of the company raised a woman who used to call me uncle when they saw a lot of snow outside, so I was proud to say uncle, and I paid tuition and I was proud of it. "" "" When I told the professor to go to my room when I told him to study at the public institute, he told me to go to my room, and when I told me to enjoy traveling alone, I thanked him a lot for his body style. ""A text message taken by a professor on Facebook and a female college student. "" I didn't want to hurt my grades or my job, "" she said. And the day when I had to endure sexual harassment after hearing all of the sexual harassment comments from the two of my betters remains a broken heart, the professor added, adding that the reality of teaching students at universities is too much. The professor later told the female college student, "" Let's be one thing, let's not get it done. "" "" Maybe 00 was oversensitive, and that's why everybody should text me to think for themselves. "" A university official said on July 8, It is an anonymous bulletin board message, so we don`t know who the writer and the professor are, and we can`t tell whether they are true. Police launched an investigation on July 5 after a posting on the same social networking site that they had sexually molested and sexually assaulted their seniors.

"Pyo Chang-won, "" Security Action Required "" before his release [CBS Kim Hyun-jung's News Show] - Prisoners ' sentenced to 12 years in jail - physical, physical, and physical destruction. I don't understand - Blue House petition 200,000 won, no appeal at all ■ Broadcast Radio CBS < Kim Hyun-jung's news show > FM 98.1 (07:30-09:00), Cameral Park : anchor Jang Hyung-jung It was 2008. A 57-year-old man sexually assaulted a girl who was only 8 years old. The court ruled that Cho Doo-soon was drunk and bought more social contribution at the time. Because of the fact that the prosecution sentenced him to 12 years in jail, much lower than his prison sentence for conventional weapons. Later on, Jodu-soon served a term. I'll be out of jail by December 2020. Time has already passed like this. That is why we should review the case before it is too late. So that's what's happening. The petition was posted on the presidential bulletin board calling for Cho Doo-soon's review, and was posted until last night. I checked until last night, but I have signed more than 200,000 people. But it is difficult under the present law to appeal. So what do we do? A victim of the Jodu-Soon incident It's an alias, how does Na-yeong's father feel about the situation? Let's meet producer Park Seon-young, who covered the story himself. Good morning producer Park Sun-young. Hello, Park Sun Young ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Actually, producer Park Sun-young asked father and daughter to appear in person and interview with her Park Seon-young : I talked on the phone for more than an hour. The victim, Na-yeong, is in the third grade, so it is a very sensitive time. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > are you already a senior in high school? Park Seon-young : Yes, it is. Especially because my father was reluctant to attend a media interview, I did not respond to the request. Kim Hyun-jung > Na-yeong is already in high school, so it has already been 9 years since he was sentenced to 12 years in jail. What did he say about the victims and their families? Park Seon-young > Cho Doo-soon would actually retaliate, this fear was considerable. My father said, "" We can't find Cho Doo-soon, but it's very scary when Cho Doo-soon found us very soon. "" And that's what happened when Cho Hyun-soon's "" No, I don't think about the presidential office hearing about Chosun in 2013. "" I'm still quite frightened about the question of release. ^ Park Seon-young > True. Let's listen to an interview. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > This is an interview in 2013. [Recording : Cho Doo-soon's father] : "" He tells me that about two years after his accident. I wrote this letter because I think a bad guy will come out in the world in 10 years, and when I become famous, I can easily spot myself. So now let's live bravely, since we can not be afraid to study hard and become smarter than children. As a child, wouldn't you be afraid? "" Actually, in 2009. Justice Minister Lee KwI-nam once made a verbal promise to keep people in permanent isolation, but did it really become an empty promise? Park Seon-young : The father of the victims promised everything that the government promised. And if it is not possible to do something with the law, I would like to go to Cho Doo-soon and attack my daughter for her safety first. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > even saying so. I feel very frank. ^ Park Seon-young > True. And if you were really frustrated, you would tell me. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I did not raise my voice during the interview, but I heard that there was something I wanted to say to the public. Park Seon-young : I would like to express my thanks to the people who supported me for a long time first. Most importantly, make the world a safe place for her. I beg of you. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : Please prepare measures to protect the victim actively. Na-young, I was a producer of news show, Park Seon-young, who covered your father's feelings yesterday. In fact, the law has one problem, one problem. They do not convict twice for the same crime based on the same offence. So even though it was a very difficult decision to make socially, it is not legally possible to appeal. Then, we should come up with other alternatives. And here's the guy. Let's connect them with the fisherman's representative Pyo Chang-won. Please stay with Congressman Pyo. Hello, Pyo Chang Won > ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : Drinking made me crazy, and when I was admitted weak in mind and body, I spent 12 years in jail. How did this horrible incident end up with only 12 years in jail? Doesn't it mean that the accused should have to accept the fact that he was too drunk to reason when the accused was over-appropriated? ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : Did you catch someone right after the crime and take a breathalyzer test? There is no record. Mr Chang-won : No, it is not. The method of the next crime does not necessarily suggest that it was carried out indiscriminately. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung, what did you see in your mind? I was lying in wait on the way to school and then I took her to a nearby building. And then the crime was committed. And if you look at the cruelty of the crime itself, you can question whether this is something that a sane human can do, but in the first half, it was devastating and then devastating. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : For example, I left the tap running. To make sure the bathroom floor is full. D. Pyo Jongchang-won > Yes And then he ran away, went to his home and hid. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. When I saw that, I had to question whether it was really a mental and mental weakness, and whether it was the case when I was drunk. Still quite a reduction in sentence. Even more absurd is the fact that I was sentenced to 12 at the time to appeal to the other side, not to the extent that I remembered, but to Cho Du-soon. It is the biggest problem. Actually, the court had seen the judge of the second trial, the appeal trial. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > did you? Although the judge said earlier that he was the victim of criminal law and criminal procedure law, he was the one who complained that it was not fair to them. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > National Security Council > Unless an appeal is made, the sentence can not be raised, the judge said. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > So, do you have this rule that the person who appealed can not issue a sentence higher than the original trial if the perpetrator or the suspect is a suspect? ^ Table source > impossible. Because it's deciding whether to accept the appeal or not, because if you don't, then what's the point of judgment on your part? So, in fact, Cho Doo-soon is a very, very astute man. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Really? When he was in the courtroom, he looked totally different from the one he had committed. I've got dyed, glasses. So, the victim couldn't recognize it. When I was talking to the judge, I was like this, but I was crazy. I was drunk and couldn't remember at all, but I did anything wrong. Forgive me, but when I do, Judge One doesn't really feel the exact scope of the police investigation report, or any of these reports. The bigger problem of the police was that they failed to convince the judge because they couldn't make enough arguments to break the drinking problem. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > The first trial did not fully inform the public. D. Pyo Jongchang-won > Yes ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > 1st trial decided that a 12 year sentence was set, and when it became public opinion, the second trial court said, "" Does it make any sense to me? "" But the decision was made when I made a stronger decision. Mr Chang-won : Yes, it is. And especially during the investigation, the parents of the affected children filed a claim against the country. Because the prosecutor told me to come to the prosecutor's office, not to investigate. That's not the last time you've gone and searched. I did the first time, and I told her there was a problem with the recording device and I had to do it again. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. I remember. D. Pyo Jongchangwon > has done it several times. And then when the case was revealed in the appeals court, the truth about the crime was more clear, and the judge said, "" This is the last thing you can do, you can't afford to accept an appeal on trial day. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : Can I appeal to you later? Isn't there any way to do that? Mr Chang-won : No, it is not. The appeal period is already over and we can not appeal when the appeal is open. ◇ There is no way to do it. Unreversible situation. That's how it happened, folks. That's how we got a 12 year sentence, and it's now nine years old. But people are starting to think that Cho Doo-soon should not be released from prison. More than 200,000 people participated in the petition. I'd like to appeal, but the law's blocked. ^ Table source > impossible. It is fundamentally impossible and fundamentally impossible. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > You might say, "" I haven't tried hard before, "" but in such cases, you are the innocent but you are the victim of an unjust jail sentence. In that case, he had a very unusual ruling to appeal. Otherwise it wouldn't be possible, would it? A convicted criminal"
"Please try the trial once again to recover the human rights of the individual, whom he is guilty of. In particular, the trial must have provided a precondition for new witnesses or new evidence that was not revealed. I have been found innocent, but I will hold you guilty again. The country can not appeal for. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > It is impossible. It is not the case that the suspect is now serving time in jail on a charge of guilt and if he or she brings clear evidence that he or she is not guilty, it would allow him to review it then. D. Pyo Jongchang-won > Yes ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > So, Mr Table, what are the alternatives, and the victim is shivering? ^ The only alternative is to take action for security. ◇ What is Kim Hyeon-jung's security disposition? A criminal punishment is punishment for a crime committed in the past. A prison ward Security measures are administrative sanctions that are made to avoid future risks. What we know now is that things like wearing an electronic anklet, making a personal appearance, and doing chemical castration. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. The attaching of electronic anklet parts of the ticket office is also imposed on Cho Doo-soon. The problem is, you can't enforce any kind of behavior by just wearing an electronic anklet. I can only tell where he is. That's why you're so nervous right now, and your society is in a state of chaos. If a new legislative measure on security measures is adopted, they can limit the residential areas or allow inspection and guidance by the one-to-one, tight-to-knit probation officer. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > But, in case of Cho Doo-soon, can we apply it retrospectively? It is not retroactive to the box office. So now we have to get off the law that punishes sexual assault punishment, etc., when we are on trial after the crime. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. ◆ Desplay > But it does not really fit the original intent of the security arrangement. I would rather give a lot of punishment, but I would like to impose additional punishment on them because they don't give me much. Rather, it risks double punishment. Alternatively, the protective measure should be taken before release because it is a protective measure taken to protect potential victims in the future. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung : Isn't that what the law says? You can not use the label. So I'm doing a thorough legal review now. To avoid future dangers, which can be called the law of the head of a dynasty And because it is a measure taken to protect potential victims, it can be prevented as long as it is enacted. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > 3 years ago, so you mean that if it is enacted and passed before Cho Doo-soon's appearance, it can be applied to it from the beginning? D. Pyo Jongchang-won > Yes ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Okay. Please send me your opinions. Thank you, Congressman Pyo Chang-won. Thank you very much. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Dubull Minjoo Party Rep. [Kim Hyun-jung's Newsshaw Program Home Right. ©CB-Nocut News (www.nocutnews.co.kr) Banned Out of Mother-Distributions and Redistribution [2016] One-Teener's Mirroring After Parroting, One in Four Newborn Parents Remake : Late. This is a result of the average age of the mother who gives birth to a baby due to married marriage to a woman increased to 32.4 years old.According to the National Statistical Office on July 7, the number of babies born to mothers aged 35 or older last year was 607,031 (26.4 percent), the first time the number of babies born to mothers in their teens or 20s was higher. As the number of elderly births increases, the birth pattern changes.Park (36) gave birth to a second child in August last year. Park said, It is dangerous to give birth to an elderly woman because many of them are underweight, and that she was relieved to have many mothers in their late 30s. Among 103 women who gave birth during October at Severance Hospital in Shinchon, 41 (40 percent) were aged 35 or older. Only 17 mothers in their teens and 20s were born. Kwon Ja-young, an OBU-U.S. professor at Severance Hospital said, "" Because of the fact that the marriage itself is late, and the number of divorces, re-married children continues to grow. "" In fact, the birth rate of children over 35 years old was 11.8 percent in 2006, but it increased 2.2 times to 3.8 percent last year. On the other hand, the number of babies born to teenagers and 20s fell significantly from 46.2 percent during the same period to 26.1 percent. One of eight stay-at-home moms aged over 40 gave birth to a second son in December last year. Kim, who married in 2009, had given birth to her first daughter the following year and continued to have her baby due to her work. After retiring three years ago, I tried to have a second child, but it was not easy. Finally, after trying three times to conceive a test-tube baby, he gave birth to one. Although I am happy to have two children as planned, my husband (43) entered college at the age of 60 and should worry about tuition, Kim said. Her husband gave birth to 54,145 children over the age of 40 last year, including Kim, and one in eight newborns was born last year. The number of babies that the father gave birth to after the age of 40 is 2.9 times higher than 20 years ago and two times higher than 10 years ago. The increase in the number of children is attributable to the increase in the number of second children and the increase in the number of parents who plan to have a second child after raising a certain number of older children.③ Since 2006, a 37-year-old twin brother gave birth to twin children last October. After experiencing an abortion once, she gave birth to a difficult baby six years after her marriage. Choi said, I had waited a long time, but I was very happy to have my brother and sister at one time. Last year, 4 percent (15,744) of babies were born. It is nearly double what it was in 2006 when it was 2.4 percent. The increase is due to the fact that the fertility rate is increasing due to the fact that the pregnancy is difficult due to marry late, and that the government has been paying for artificial insemination since 2006. The number of triplets has also increased from 186 in 2010 to 369 last year.Jimo gave birth to her first son at age 36 and had a baby last year. Since she married late at the age of 35, I thought it would be better to have a baby and raise it as soon as possible, Lee said.Until now, it has been common for babies to be born two years old. In fact, in 1996, the first and second turnles were, on average, 2.24 and 2.01 in 2006, but were reduced to an average of 1.82 (10 months per year) last year. The gap between the second and third offspring has been further narrowed. It was 2.8 1996 and 2.2 2006, but it was 1.51 (1 year and 6 months) last year.The second and third turns are narrower than the first and second ones. It is believed to have occurred in a hurry to start giving birth late and finish it before the age of 40.Lee (36) gave birth to her first daughter in September last year. It has been a year and three months since she married. It was difficult to find a mate since working in Sejong City, but I met a office worker named Kim (37, Seoul) on a blind date and had a healthy baby due to natural childbirth. Among mothers aged 35 or older, 36.3 percent gave birth to their first child last year, followed by 44.8 percent of those in the second and 15.7 percent. Ten years ago (2006), 29.3 percent of respondents said they were in the first group, 41.6 percent, and 23.9 percent. Ten years into the first part of the year, the third part of the month was greatly shortened.One of the reasons for the low fertility rate is the fact that the proportion of mothers who are older than their mothers to give birth to their third child has decreased significantly, said Lim Seon-young, an gynecologist.[Kim Dong-seop, health and welfare reporter dskim@chosun.com] [Go to Dongsan.com] - Works for Chosun Ilbo & chosun.com, no reproduction or redistribution -"
