Residents of the regions share cold pictures or video clips via social media, pretending to be weathers. The Atlantic white shark protection team reported on Facebook that they found the bodies of two wild sharks floating off the coast of Cape Cod Bay in northeastern Massachusetts on July 27. The two are about the same size, and seem to have been driven by a cold shock, the protection team explained.A woman in southeast Ontario, Canada, said on Twitter on Tuesday, "" I've had some cold pictures, but my windows haven't cracked. "" A man from southern Winnipeg, Canada, posted a video on Twitter that showed the cup frozen solid as it was splayed into the air.There was also a man who was scattering cups in the air. A woman in Michigan, U.S., photographed and shared a picture of a man slipping along like a ski, tying a rope to a wagon that runs on white snow fields while driving.[USA : Machisky's] [Source : Facebook] The cold sometimes led to sports events being changed or canceled. Canada's Bell Capital Cup said that international junior hockey tournament matches are being moved from outdoors to indoor because of the extreme cold. In addition, polar bear swimming contests, in which dozens or even hundreds of people have jumped into the sea each year at this time in the United States and Canada, were held in parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania due to severe weather. CNN told reporters, "" I don't understand why I would jump into the sea at the risk of frostbite and hypothermia, but I think I'd miss it. "" The United States and Canada are suffering from severe cold, with the temperature falling to minus 40 degrees Celsius. Most regions are still covered with snow from last Christmas, and the cold is expected to continue until early next year. ▽ Snowing up in Pennsylvania [AP] gogogo@yna.co.kr < Report and inquiry on April 27. The female owner of the drama was her paternal aunt (36) and her aunt (35) mother (61). Ko, a biological father, has been living her daily life calmly after wrapping up her daughter. She also said, "" As if my daughter were alive for nearly eight months, she cheats the people around her, and made alibles with elaborate determination. ""Upon returning to her birthday as a female burial daughter, Jeonju Deokjin Police Station arrested Ko's father and Kim's mother on July 28 on suspicion of releasing her body at around 8 p.m. According to police, Kim treated Jun-hee to dinner and slept at her home in Inhu-dong, Jeonju, around 6 p.m. on April 26. At the time, Yoon-hee was in charge of raising her daughter. After finishing her night work, her father Ko arrived at the Kim's house to pick up her daughter's clothes at around 1:00 a.m. on July 27. Koh said Jun-hee had already spattered the material from her mouth and died. Kim and Ko loaded Jun-hee into the trunk of Kim`s car between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. and headed for a hill in Gunsan. It was the site of the tomb of his grandfather. They dug a hole about 30cm deep and buried the sheep. Jun-hee buried the toys and dolls from her car that she used to play with. The sale of the eggs took about an hour and a half. After the crime, Ko dropped Kim off at home and went back to her apartment in Wanju-gun. They claim they did not contact the girlfriend Lee during the process. After bloodletting Jun-hee, the family began to build an alibi with great precision. Since April when Ko left her daughter in charge, she has sent 500,000 to 700,000 won to her account each month as childcare expenses. Even after Jun-hee died, he sent money every month as usual. To show that Miss Jun-hee is alive in the neighborhood, she is displayed in the house with her daily necessities, clothing, and toys. Lee, who was born on July 22, sent seaweed soup to her friends. Lee played "" We Jun-hee is doing well, "" while having dinner with her acquaintances. Lee's mother, Kim, hurried home from a meeting with acquaintances, saying, I have to go home early because of my child. The police said, There are clear signs of making an alibi for the investigation.They also took away mobile phones, which could have been a crucial clue to the investigation, before reporting them missing. Koh newly opened her cell phone at a mobile operator's office in Deokjin-gu, Jeonju on Oct. 31. Lee, a young girl, and her mother Kim changed their cell phones in the same place on July 14. However, the cell phones were stolen, causing confusion in police investigations.When the police pressed for the location of the mobile phone, they turned into an open investigation on July 15, and one kilometer of the group's search was carried out using 3,000 soldiers, helicopters, and rubber boats. However, since the three of them had drawn up the script in advance, the investigation was difficult. They only gave statements that were in their favor, and refused or denied anything that was disadvantageous to them. Police tried to investigate the lie detectors and the law hypnosis but `` We're the victims, '' they said. The near-zero incident was reported when police searched for the location of the mobile phone and called records. Police grilled Ko and her mother on the day of the sale, asking why they had been together in Gunsan on the day of the sale. The two also grilled each other about their unusual frequent calling. Finally, around 8:00 p.m. on July 28, Ko confessed to selling the baby.Ko appeared on the scene of police searching for Miss Jun-hee early Monday morning, covering her face with a mask and hat. He bowed down without saying anything to the reporters ' questions. We are in the middle of a divorce suit with her ex-wife, and when it is revealed that Joon-hee is dead, we will have to move the bodies out of custody to avoid paying child support, he said. Koh had two sons and one daughter with her ex-wife. Jun-hee is the youngest daughter. Koh's two sons are cared for by his ex-wife. Police collected the body of a woman and asked the National Institute of Scientific Investigation for an autopsy. We are also investigating the possibility of Jun-hee being murdered, police said. - [a pole = gimjeongyeop] [shortcut to the dotcom] copyrights © 5 Kits combine the Chosun Ilbo, and Ulsan reserved.The - a garden phlox of apartment complexes and com chosun.(= Ulsan, Korea, Yonhap News Agency) colonies isanghyeon (the right) oleander colony built next to the Journalist : a children's playground in an apartment complex in Ulsan. risk a board with property management office.Managed by demanding, residents were removed but extremely toxic. 2017.12.30 (= Ulsan, Korea, Yonhap News Agency) isanghyeon reporters are a garden apartment complex in place, Ulsan, planting it is extremely toxic oleander, dozens of trees where residents are nervous.

"The labor newspaper added to the photo of the first photo of Kim Jong-il, but after being knighted, "" Don't be so careful, "" "" Don't be so suspicious, "" and "" so don't worry about damaging the best of the three-leading North Korean leader, Kim Il-sung's office, "" About 50 photos of Kim Jong-un are published in the newspaper. Yonhap news agency, "" Photo No. 1. "" North Koreans call photographs with the faces of top leaders like this. Photographs of the first were rare when Kim took power. Kim, a film buff, was reportedly interested in creating images but did not show much confidence on the screen. Hiding helps him gain charisma. Maybe it is because the generation has changed. The son is different from the chairman of the ruling Workers ` Party. Photographs No. 1 have become common. And it is growing. The largest number of photos of Kim Jong-un's first year in 2012 were published in the Labor Bronch-borne Journal on July 26, when his wife, Li Sol-ju, first took the title. Twenty-eight photographs of the first number were posted on six pages. This year, the Rodong Sinmun had 50 pictures of Kim Jong-un. It was the day after Kim Jong-un's climb to the mountain. He used to climb Mt. Baekdu every year around this time. The Rodong Sinmun, the labor newspaper, photographed 10 sides with four sides more than usual in order to process the pictures. If Kim is the director, Kim Jong-un is an actor. Not long ago North Korea's Daily NK reported that "" the word "" enemy Kim Jong-un's favorite style "" has become prevalent in North Korean metropolitan areas centered in Pyongyang. "" You can easily hear the word ' I really have a lot of photos in the Rodong Sinmun when I go to the place where the people gathered, ' and because I love taking pictures of my foes in Pyongyang, "" one source said. According to the media, the nuances were mostly negative. Most of all, it is also pointed out as evidence of the fact that Kim Jong-un's `` picturalism '' is not meant to antagonize residents. Image politics was the way Kim Jong-un, who hurriedly inherited power in a short period of time with little political success, chose to become the top leader. She was dressed up as her grandfather, Kim Il-sung, and went to contact residents, visited the economic scene, and smiled broadly as if she were a military leader. And in the picture, I put the scene. The Rodong Sinmun, the head of the North Korean Workers ' Party, said yesterday that he climbed the mountain with Choi Ryong-hae, vice chairman of the ruling Workers ' Party. The paper said Kim Jong-un climbed through the snow, but the clothes and shoes in the photo were neat. The picture of Yonhap news agency is also wonderful. It is because experienced image planners and film experts are each in charge of directing and filming. A touching supporting actor and cheering extra make the main actor's self-absorbed performance stand out. However, the reaction of the people these days has been cold. Sources quoted by Daily NK said most residents believe the enemy is ' camera conscious. ' Some even say that after the purge of his uncle (Jang), he is working especially hard on photography to shed the image of a cold-blooded leader who has been recognized by residents. It could be a side effect of a factitious performance. Residents know that if they see pictures of the mountain climbing on July 9, Kim Jong-un's clothes and shoes are too neat for those who climbed the snow, but vehicles can run to the top of the mountain. It is not just emotional inconvenience. The exaggerated picture of number one bothers people in many ways. You must be careful first. It's similar to when the burdensome supreme dignity appears frequently around me. If the photo is damaged, they will have to prepare for the execution of political prisoners. Some in the field complain that it is hard to find papers to smoke because there are more photos of No. 1 on the front pages of newspapers.

Three of the four ships that received 3,500 tons of each oil refining item from Winmore were also confirmed to have been rented by the same company. South Korean authorities acknowledged in late October that the other 600 tons of South Korean cargo, which was delivered via the video of the Korea-U.S. cooperation, was in violation of North Korea's Samjung-2 ship, and thus violated the South Korean Council. South Korean authorities confirmed that the ship had delivered refinery products to the North Korean vessels by investigating the captain and others when it entered Yeosu port on Nov. 24. However, a customs official said, We could not confirm who was in charge of the transactions because we don`t have the right to investigate the Taban-based charter company.

"The reason why the survivor Choi Seung-woo visited the National Assembly again is already lying down in front of the National Assembly on the night of minus 10 degrees Celsius. The two are brothers who survived the attack : Choi Seung-woo and Han Jong-sun. People were already asked whether the case, which had caused quite a stir years ago, had been solved, but they said it was hurtful to hear it. They are again coming to the National Assembly. - The reporter said, "" Choi Seung-woo has been in front of the National Assembly for more than 50 days. "" On July 27 at 9 p.m. and at the end of the year, a middle-aged plastic tent made a man move into the main gate of Yeouido. Touch and touch with the crack. "" There you go, of course. It hasn't changed. Ho. "" On the yellow coat he wore, it says, "" The Brothers Bokjiwon Victimentage Group. "" By the tent, the faded mandarine began, in a crooked hand, with the words, "" Siblings of Brothers and Brothers has never been solved ... "" to replace his locked voice. Pedestrians rolling past him disappear, saying, "" Hey, it's 10 below zero tonight. "" Standing idly by, Choi Seung-woo (49), a survivor of the Busan Brothers Bokjiwon, is dead.She has to eat cup noodles or instant noodles once a day and stay in the middle of an intermediate sleep, but Choi and Han Jong-seon (42), another victim of the movie, began a protest in front of the National Assembly on November 7. The revision to the National Assembly's law on the truth and reconciliation is still pending.It was the 51st night of a protest by the National Assembly.Choi Seung-woo, who has been on strike for about 50 days in front of the National Assembly, said, "" If Kim Seong-wook isn't here to say hello, I'll come in and have a cup of tea. As the two of them turned on the bursta in a space that was almost full of people, the water boiled in the kettle, and it seemed to cool down the chill a little. He started out in a warm mixed-mill car, saying, "" I was going home a little late from school when I was 14, and I was suddenly taken by the police and took it with me. I didn't steal the real bread. Excuse me? But he's just taking me with him, and he's constantly hitting me and torturing me for stealing bread. When I heard about it later, I'd give her a rating. "" It was April 1982. He was then sent to the brothers ' home. It was only a few minutes before he went home from the garden to his house in Gaegeum-dong, but Choi never went home for more than four years.The office was a ' welfare facility ' operated from 1975 to 1987 in Jurye-dong, Buk-gu, Busan, but in reality, it imprisoned street vagabonds for beating, abusing, raping and forcing them to work. In 12 years, as many as 4,000 people were forced into the siblings ' home, and only formally, 513 were killed. Park In-keun, then chief of the Brothers ' Welfare Service, used inmates to embezzle more than 1 billion won in state aid, including innocent police and district officials who were labeled as "" vagabonds. "" Choi was one of them. ▲ ~ If you hit your brother in front of the National Assembly for 50 days and you were talking about the violence, you would get hurt in the camp. Rape. I still remember. The first day I walked in, I hung my anus at a powerful platoon leader or an adult there. There wasn't a little pretty looking baby who hadn't been gang-raped. Because I had a girl friend. I lived as a woman in the platoon for about a year and a half. They're called by the platoon leader at night. "" I couldn't run away, I couldn't commit suicide. "" And in the course of my life, my anus burst, and I was in pain to death completely. I wanted to run away rather than die like this, but I got caught and was beaten to death again. You can just bury them when they die. After that, I couldn't think of running away anymore. I tried to die a few times, but I was repeatedly taken and beaten, and I was beaten ... "" And his daily life at Bokjiwon was hell. He said he had taken many raw teeth from his older brothers and used dentures from 30s. Unquenchable brainwashing, violence, discipline, class discipline, construction work in the compound, iron work, sewing, shoes, and lacquer work. "" And that was going to be a very difficult thing to do. I'd like to live now in comfort. "" His breathing became sluggish.Choi Seung-woo, the survivor of the brother Bokjiwon who has been on strike in front of the National Assembly for more than 50 days, was able to return to Korea by his father and paternal grandmother in October 1986. After he entered the hospital, he was caught on the same street as his brother and sent to a brother and sister. But his more than four years at the siblings ' home had already eaten into him deeply. He was afraid of society. "" He became a monster. I have become too violent. When I first came out, I was confused about my gender ... You'd tell me you'd never beat or rape or anything like that. I mean, I've got a bully to do since I was 20. I went abroad because I hated the world, but I didn't know the society so I was used and exploited. I couldn't help but be a gangster. "" He said, "" He's crazy, especially when it comes to the police. "" He was enraged at the fact that he had taken him to be a brother and sister. When I used my fist, I ran to the police and beat them like crazy. "" He said, "" I think it would be a good 20 times before I let myself in on my official duty. "" It was hard to imagine him as he served us junk, kimchi, and even glutinous rice, all packed up with tents.- They're still right next to you. You ok? "" Ah, now it's okay. I don't know that he is a bad guy anymore. Ho. "" It was a lot of grief to hear of his brother's suicide when he was in and out of jail. "" And he said to himself, "" My sister came out and mourned a lot. It was after all these brothers and sisters had been there. Traumatic. He finally committed suicide in 2009. After that, I tried to die a few times, but I never did. I just wanted to wake up suddenly. "" He was treated at a trauma treatment center that he had learned with the help of his neighbors. Although they are currently basic beneficiaries, they do not receive any money under the name of "" Brother and Family Welfare Service victim. "" As victims of the war, I feel confident and healthy, so I have become absorbed in studying English and theater. "" He kept a good smile while talking about his hard life.Incompetency, but Choi Seung-woo, who has been on strike in front of the National Assembly for more than 50 days, says, "" It's easy. I want you to get to the bottom of it. Are we interested in our problems and gradually cooling down? I mean, the protests, press conference, fasting, shaving, and long journey around the country ... Not long ago, I went to the Blue House, but I went to the National Assembly to make laws. So stay here again. It's a national violence. The state ruined our lives, and why should she stay here in the cold? Is it really the nation you were told to use? If you see the National Assembly here, you can see that the story of the brothers and sisters is already running wild. The brother and sister welfare incident, which was fully publicized around 2014, received much public attention as many people gathered on the shocking truth. However, nothing has changed as Choi said. Due to public interest, the law, which was adopted in the 19th National Assembly, was finally repealed when it was repeatedly made, and the related laws are still slow to proceed in the National Assembly. There are even a number of follow-up reports that the scandal over the brother's brother, the Welfare Service, was not changed a year after it was opened to public opinion. Still, this sense of helplessness that I still, really, must write that nothing has changed. A little frustration that Choi felt when he announced that he was lying down in front of the National Assembly again. Choi's last cry was, "" You're the reporter?Gee? Let's move on to society. "" I was speechless. * The following is continued :Copyright Copywriter (c) Omai News (Citizen Reporters), Unauthorized Child and Redistribution geumji ☞ ne majimak se [ gingeup ] wol ho seutori kaempein gajok mit nyuseu ... ...

"New Students Refuse to Be Closed The first day before the vacation The Seoul School closes for the Public School Review Board "" No closing decision … Provide full access to students ' education "" Kang Se-hun, a reporter at New York University in Seoul According to the education office on July 30, Eunhye Elementary School (Eunhye Elementary School) applied for a permit to close its doors to its parents in the afternoon of July 28 and notified the same day.In a letter to parents, the school said, "" The financial deficits among students due to years of accounting at private schools have been offset by rising financial deficits, "" adding, "" This year, the number of new applicants has decreased by 60.We decided to close school in late February 2018 after consulting law firms as we judged that it would be impossible to operate properly in 2018, the official said. The surprise news from the school sent parents into confusion. One parent said, "" I received notice of closing from the school on the 28th before the vacation ceremony. "" "" I was busy searching other schools, and in the case of public schools, I didn't receive applications in advance. ""Some parents are even reportedly considering taking legal action. The other parent said, "" If the school board chairman avoids the responsibility of principals and teachers and does not present any countermeasures on what the children will do, the parents are already closing their doors to freshmen. "" We are also thinking of taking action, such as asking parents to pay for damages.As resistance from parents spread, the education office started to take care of it.We have received an application to close our schools on July 28, but it has not been decided yet, said an official at the Seoul Western District Office of Education, guaranteeing the students ` right to study and guaranteeing our first priority. "" We can look for other ways to do it without closing, and if we close it, we can wait until the children finish their school, "" the official said.The school also explained that it was not true what it said was recommended by the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education to close schools.The advice is the first time we have heard of a closure, he said. We have checked with the school to see who made the recommendation, he said. However, it is also possible that the closing of schools will become reality after taking measures to deploy students. When a request is made, we will judge and review the plan to distribute the students, he said, saying, If it meets the rules, we will have to approve the plan.Back in 2015, Aloishio Elementary School in Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul was closed. However, this school was founded to teach children without parents, and this school was closed for the reason of changing social perceptions. It is the first time that an elementary school in Seoul has reviewed closing because of financial difficulties stemming from a decline in the number of students who take over school.We understand that although religious or disabled schools have sometimes closed down due to a decline in the number of students, no regular private elementary schools have closed down in Seoul, said an official at the private education office. kangse@newsis.com> North Korea's Oil Supply and Oil Ministry (PG) [Production, Choi Ja-yoon] [Trade and Security Council's Resolution Evacuation] fail.

'' chinakim@yna.co.kr As the aging process progresses and other investment destinations can not be guaranteed, households are reportedly preferring safe assets with little to no loss. According to the Bank of Korea (BOK) on July 30, households and non-profits owned 377.52 trillion won at the end of September. Among them, the amount of cash was recorded at 78.22559 trillion won. The cash held by households increased by 9.93 trillion won to 949.5 billion won compared with 68.22 trillion won at the end of last year. Household cash holdings are on the rise. It was the second quarter of this year when the increase in household cash holdings (as a substitute for electricity) was below the increase in financial assets from the first quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of this year. In the third quarter, the cash growth rate stood at 9.1 percent, seven times higher than that of financial assets (1.3 percent). In addition, the amount of cash in the household during the third fiscal quarter increased by 6.55 trillion won to 536.6 billion won, the biggest increase in the previous quarter. Therefore, the proportion of cash in household financial assets was only 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 when statistics were first compiled, but increased to 2.2 percent in the third quarter of this year. Analysts say that the accumulation of cash in households is related to preference for safe assets. Some households are still shirking in fear of blowing bubbles despite the fierce investment of virtual money. In the BOK`s currency use behavior survey of 2015, 38.7 percent of households answered that they would hold more cash if economic uncertainties widened. It appears to have an effect on the preference of cash, a safer asset than other assets, said Kim Chun-koo, an economist at Hyundai Economic Research Institute. Some analyze that the increase in the household's cash holdings is due to the deepening of the aging society. Cash holdings in the over-60s were highest among the total age group at 16.4 percent, according to the central bank`s report. The tendency among the elderly is higher than other age groups, explained the central bank, It is possible that future progress in aging could lead to an increase in demand for the Korean currency. porque@yna.co.kr"

Winmore arrived in Yeosu on Oct. 11 to load up its Japan-made oil refining products and set sail for Taiwan, according to the Foreign Ministry and customs authorities. However, the East China Sea after four days without going to Taiwan shifted an oil product in four ships in international waters. One of them was the North Korean vessel, Samjung-2. It is not clear whether Samjung-2 has returned to North Korea with its refinery products in stock. The government confirmed this on Oct. 19 through cooperation on information assets between the two countries. When the Winmore vessel entered Yeosu Harbor again on July 24, it was detained. The government has been closely exchanging satellite images and other satellite images with U.S. diplomatic and intelligence officials since September to monitor the movements of North Korean vessels, according to diplomatic sources. The report secured evidence of contact with North Korean vessels from more than 10 foreign ships. Winmore is known to be one of the ships. We have discussed the Winmore issue dozens of times since it was first recognized by the Korean and U.S. authorities on Oct. 19, the source said.

"▽ Moneytoday Geoje = Park Jun-sik, a reporter and Park ChI-hyeon. The picture is showing the population of Geoje City, which enjoyed its biggest boom three years ago, following the construction of high-rise apartments and commercial facilities in Geoje, as well as Busan and Ulsan. As the shipbuilding industry, which led the urban economy, declined sharply, jobs were lost, and businesses in the areas that enjoyed the benefits of the booming Joseon Dynasty collapsed, people left the cities. According to Geoje City and related businesses on November 28, the number of Koreans in the city has continued to grow until last year for the last 10 years, but this year, 2,825 people turned their backs on each other. Based on the registration population of Geoje, the number of Joseon plant makers was 258,288 in 2015 and 257,7183 in 2016, respectively, but has decreased to 253,588 this year. Geoje is estimated to have 20,000 daily workers who worked at a shipbuilding plant left the city after running out of work during the past two years. Geoje Mayor Kwon Min-ho said, After the official statistics, we were forced to leave the private sector to set foot on many people who worked as day laborers and the private sector based on their own economic fundamentals, and the town was forced to turn away from the city's population. The decline of the shipbuilding industry together with Geoje can be checked for business units and associated employees. The number of businesses decreased by 423 from 12,388 during the boom in 2015 to 10,495 last year. As a result, the number of employed workers decreased to 127,366 from 133,555 during the same period. Due to the sluggish shipbuilding industry, the number of foreigners staying in the city has decreased as a result. The dispatched workers of the ordering office, their families, and related service industries have returned home. The number of foreigners in Geoje decreased to 10,4178 last year from 15,551 in 2015, but decreased to 9469 this November, down 37 percent from two years ago. Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. and Samsung Heavy Industries Co., both of which have operations in Geoje, are preparing to restructure their workforce further as sluggish orders put them at a premium and worsening financial soundness. The number of regular and non-functional workers who stood at around 30,000 to 40,000 last year was cut by 10,000 this year, and it is expected that the staff will be cut by more than 5,000 next year. Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering received about 7 trillion won in government support over the course of two years, and Samsung Heavy Industries is also considering increasing its capital increase by the unit for the second year in a row. The company's labor union is demanding a raise in wages for the third day of a sit-in at the light tower in front of the Okpo shipyard. The recession in Geoje, coupled with the reporter Park Joon-sik's shipbuilding industry, is having a negative effect on the entire economy. The volume of real estate transactions was sharply raised from 15,9598 cases of land and 43,53 cases of apartments last year to 12,4262 cases (27 percent) and 3222 cases (26 percent U.S.C. The number of apartments where daily workers stayed was 6.6 percent last March, up from 27.4 percent last December. Apartment prices dropped from 100 in June 2015 to 87.3 at the end of last year, and fell to 79.9 late last month. Apartment rental price index also dropped to 80.4 from 100 during the same period. As the real estate market in Geoje has collapsed due to the collapse in business areas, merchants, rental businesses and amusement workers are leaking to other regions, it is expected that it will be difficult to turn around for a while.Geoje is planning to collect the bubbles of its boom and attract the third service industry, including the tourism industry, during the course of two to three years of construction of a shipyard. As shipbuilders are forecasting improvement in the 2020 business, they are not going to stop building new plants with a long-term vision. The collapse of the corporate sector has resulted in the opening of a joint town across the border in Gunsan, North Jeolla Province. As of the end of November, the population of this year in the region was 273,500, down 2,000 from last year. The population reached 280,000 between 2011 and 2012 when the local economy was in full swing, but the numbers have decreased significantly. This is the result of Hyundai Heavy Industries and Construction's temporary closure of its plant and GM Korea's reduction of production due to a lack of work. ▶ Looking back 2017 ' Ten Keywords ' … Enjoy Free Cartoons and Win! ▶ Cheerleader vs. Racing Girl Geoje (Gyeongnam) = journalist Park Jun-sik, press win0479@mt.co.kr, Real estate followed by declaring ' war on speculation ' on virtual currency. The Financial Services Commission will establish a virtual currency response team composed of five to six persons starting next month. It is not clear whether the fire will be put out. Bitcone, a popular virtual currency, was 1 million won per unit in January, but it exceeded 20 million won this month. We will use all possible means, a financial authorities official said on July 29. Is virtual money the future of finance? Maybe it is just a bubble. Questions were asked in round. - Who first made it? Bitcone was developed by an unidentified programmer named Nakamoto SatoshI. Whether it is an individual or not is a national nationality is shrouded in mystery. Nakamoto will publish a nine-page paper, entitled "" Bitcone : P2P e-cashed system, "" on the Internet at (bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) The program opens next year and is the first to be issued with a beat coin. "" - How to get it. To get the bit coins, we need to solve a complicated math problem that can be solved only with a computer. There were also companies that began to mine Bitcone. You can buy it directly from the individual through the virtual currency exchange. You can leave the obtained bit coins in the exchange or keep them in your own PC or an electronic purse. "" - I don't know if it's in real life and it's dangerous. Virtual money is based on block chain technologies. A technique of concepts for sharing the contents of all transactions and the digital books of a transaction to all parties. Existing money should be kept on a central server such as a bank. Virtual money does not need such a central server. In theory, the transaction details are lower in risk of forgery and alteration than the existing currency controlled by the Bank. Because it is virtually impossible to manipulate the digital records held by all parties at once. "" - The exchange is hacked. "" Having low operational risks does not change the value of gold itself as easily. "" Once again the transactions recorded on the block chain are virtually impossible to manipulate. However, if the security of an electronic purse connected to the Internet is weak, the coin can be extracted using malicious codes. And since virtual currency exchanges are not using block chain books and only hold the users ' virtual bills, they can not be completely free from the danger of hacking. It is safer to keep it in an individual block chain electronic purse, but it is possible to steal or lose a private key that serves as the key. "" - Can the actual payment of a coin be made with a bit of coin in Korea? "" Payment can be made directly on the basis of the market price. Assuming that the Bitchin rate is 20 million won per line, you will be using 0.0025 coins to buy 50,000-won objects. "" - Is it possible for the exchange to close down in Indonesia? However, virtual currency is always available to trade over the Internet. Unless the global exchange closes down at once, it could be virtually impossible to block individuals ` purchase of virtual currency on the overseas exchange by using the currency of the country, and thus make it virtually impossible to block the transaction's real name. It is difficult to know who is actually trading. They plan to stop the system and establish a real-name transaction system. New virtual accounts will be suspended until the system is established, making it difficult for new investors to enter the bank. Regulations, such as sanctions and a limit on the limit of transactions per capita on real name, may be introduced. "" - The future of virtual currency is. "" Those who see it negatively see no substance in virtual currency. At least it is the bubble that has gained in value, ' said Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett, ' You can trade on checks, but you can't give paper any great value for that. ' They say the price fluctuations are so high that it is difficult to make payment as a means. On the other hand, the affirmative sees future financial transactions will be made based on virtual money. They say that it will lead to financial reform since it enables swift transactions, eliminates the inconvenience of having to go through the central bank. Bill Huit Gates, founder of Microsoft, said in 2014, "" Bitcoin is better than the existing currency such as dollars in large-scale transactions.

Mobile phone service providers are believed to have increased publicly available support for the medium - and middle-sized phones to target holiday demand and to sell off their stocks at the last minute. Although the mid-price support system has significantly increased, it is desirable for consumers to carefully compare the 25 % rate discount and benefits before purchasing. According to the industry on July 30, KT raised the subsidy of LG Q48, which was sold at 616,000 won. As a result of this increase, the G8 receives additional support (15 percent of the public support) from the data plan, which enables the actual purchase price to be at 0 won. ▽ KT Phone Biway Phone 2, which costs 390,000 won per month, also saw its actual purchase price rise to 0 won on the system of charges of 60,000 won or more as support increased. KT also raised the subsidy of its older version of the G4 by 33,000-140,000 won. Starting with a 50,000-won fee, the amount of money will be equivalent to the cost of the purchase (699,600 won), so you can get it for free. SK Telecom raised the subsidy of X201, which costs around 280,000 won, to a free phone with a fee of more than 60,000 won. Some products are even available free of charge.Galaxy On o006, a smartphone priced at 340,000 won per conversation, was released by a free phone at KT's total fee the previous day. LG U-Plus also raised its Galaxy J1 (2017) support fee to 240,000 won on July 28, and is selling for 0 won in the entire system. Even if the phone is released for free, it is necessary to compare the discount and benefits of 25 percent when purchasing the product. The discount may outweigh the support. For example, if the total subsidy amount is less than the total amount of 330,000 won (46,000,000 U.S. dollars), it would be better to choose a discount. okko@yna.co.kr and inquiry, 1:1 chatting with reporters on July 29, Kim Joon-beom, a reporter at Hyundai Steel Mill factory in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, said yesterday, adding, It is believed that the explosion occurred yesterday.

"Starting from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Private Road Law, the Special Road Act on the Greenbelt [Combined News TV] will also pass the Road Executives Act. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said yesterday that it passed the parliamentary plenary session a day before the revision to the pay-for-paid road law. The revised law takes effect one year after the preparation procedures. A new clause has been set up to provide discounts on transportation fees on the Samil and Chuseok holidays. In addition, toll fees on toll roads, including private roads, will not be allowed to rise as they exceed consumer price hikes. In the event traffic or toll revenues fall short of 70 percent of the estimated amount of the enforcement agreement, or if the private equity operator issues high-yielding debt or changes in transportation conditions, the government has made a traffic pact. There is also a reason to collect unpaid transportation fees for the Sami-Korea Expressway. In addition, the National Assembly passed a revision to the Private Rental Housing Act, which seeks to establish publicly-supported private rental housing. Public supported private rental houses are rental apartments that are subject to public obligation such as maintaining a rental period of more than eight years and limiting the rent fee and the qualifications of tenants instead of receiving public support such as funding or land rent. If the exemption is granted, the government will have a duty to provide public rental or to the residents who are eligible for housing support, such as those of youths and newlyweds. Private rental housing for more than 100 households is reported to local governments by the end of the month of the scheduled change of lease contract, and local governments may recommend an excessive rent increase if it is judged to be necessary. The law is scheduled to take effect in July next year. The revision to the National Assembly's Special Law on the Appointment and Management of Development Zones, which was barely extended to the end of 2020 when mandatory levy is imposed on people who live in restricted areas until the end of the year.

(Photo : Potoria) In modern times without plastic products, a wide variety of plastic products is used around us. Its convenience and usefulness are beyond doubt, but environmental pollution is becoming a problem. While it is a challenge not to rot underground for long periods of time and to pollute the surrounding environment, the new environmental concern has recently focused on fine plastic products that are decomposed into the ocean and produced.The problem with micro-plastic is that many organisms are mistaken for food and taken in because they are difficult to distinguish from plankton. Eventually, micro-plastic enters the food chain and can harm all marine life and possibly even those who consume seafood. Fortunately, plastic is not serious enough to limit marine consumption until now, but the marine ecosystem is worried that the large amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean each year will not be able to recover.But the interesting thing is that sea creatures can make plastic waste into plastic by breaking it up smaller. A team led by Professor Richard Thompson of the University of Plymouth identified one common marine crustacean, the osestia gammarellus, which was also one of the most common plastic bags.Translucent plastic waste can be mistaken for a form of food for this tiny marine creature. The researchers examined them in the Occista lab and the actual environment to see how they cut plastic bags. The results showed that plastic bags were cut to a smaller size than 488.59 μ m. This can be understood as one medium plastic bag breaking down into 1.75 million pieces. Of course, these carved plastic bags do not provide nutrients to sea creatures, but they are more likely to be mistaken for food.In fact, it is hard to blame marine life for this problem. That is because it would not have occurred if someone had not thrown away trash in the first place. Like all waste products, the best way to solve marine waste pollution is not to throw it out. In particular, be aware that someday marine waste pollution can be brought back to your mouth. Trash thrown into the sea or on the beach in person, as well as waste thrown by the roadside, can be washed into the sea. The study appears to be a good example of how even a bag can become a serious pollutant.Gordon and columnist, ▶ jjy0501@naver.com interesting world, ▶ [Now news] [free of cartoon] [Facebook] ⓒ unauthorized war damage and (www.seoul.co.kr), the newspaper Seoul.Redistribution of the ban [anchor] Lee Myung-bak administration in the National Intelligence Service of the United Arab Emirates to build atomic power plants the government's Park Geun-hye 'dual contract' with regard to make secret investigation of allegations that circumstances.I said (28) yesterday.

Hubo traveled about 150 meters and a big wall blocked the road. Hubo broke through the wall with a drill on her right hand and handed over the torch she had held on her left hand to the next runner. Yumi conducted the orchestra with detailed hands.In September, a human-like robot named Yumi took the helm in front of an orchestra at Teatro VerdI Theater in Pisa, Italy. His right hand signals beats and he drew his breath, while his left hand gave him gorgeous hands. Music director Andrea ColombinI evaluates, "" I have completely recreated the conductor's smooth moves and expressive capability. "" Man-like humanoid products are evolving rapidly. Major companies in the world, which were judged to be highly utilized, are competing for development. A humanoid robot is a humanoid robot that can perform similar motions as a human. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) is installed in sensors that feel visual, auditory, tactile, positioning, and inclination, and is becoming more and more similar to humans. In fact, the humanoid maker failed to make commercial use of its defective two-haired walking although it received great attention in 2000 when it unveiled Asimo. However, as the technology of walking with two legs has recently developed, major companies are speeding up the commercialization of robots for home and industry. With 32 joints and 10 fingers, ' T-RS3 ' implements human-smoothy smooth actions. The T - HR 3, published by Toyota, Japan, has 32 joints and 10 fingers. It implements smooth actions such as moving like an avatar, standing on one foot, and moving a balloon without blowing. Toyota explained, The goal is to make the robot become a practical partner of people. Atlas Shrugged has been upgraded to back-rotation levels. Created by Boston Dynamics in the United States, Atlas Shook the world by walking and lifting boxes itself up, and now it has been forced to step over obstacles and turn backwards. Boston Dynamics was acquired by SoftBank, chairman of Samsung Group, from Google in June. "" The robot is the best at keeping human movement alive, "" explained Boston Dynamics, adding, "" The ability to avoid and balance obstacles is so great that an annual average of $ 243.4 billion for each dangerous field of human beings is expected to go to market. "" The reason why I am interested in humanoid products is that they have a wider range of uses than ordinary machines. According to LG Economic Research Institute, while the wheel system is 30 percent and the unlimited track method is 50 percent, the walking approach boasts nearly 100 percent. In other words, they can move even when the wheels are out of orbit. A wheeled robot cleaner can not move because it is hooked on the threshold of a house, but a two-footed humanoid can clean as he crosses the threshold. Cost-effectively, it is more efficient to have a humanoid robot than to have several specialized robots. For example, a humanoid, complete implementation of human movement, can operate without the need to purchase an autonomous car. By allowing human tools to be grasped and used, it becomes an industrial machine. It means that many robots, machines, and artificial intelligence can be replaced with one humanoid robot. Because of the low technology barrier, rehabilitation, education, and disaster response are among the areas that can be applied in the near future. As the low birth rate and aging population grow, it is not easy for major countries to find workers to care for the elderly and disabled. Replacing human beings with humanoid humans can reduce labor costs, collect patient data, and make appropriate prescriptions. Jin Seok-yong, director of the LG Economic Research Institute, said, "" French humanoid workers are already being taught mathematics, science, and other fields are not being explored in mathematics, nor are they being used in such a way as to answer the questions of human beings? "" Robot experts predict that humanoid robots will eventually evolve into emotional robots that can interact with humans with the development of artificial intelligence. They say that not only the appearances, but also the actions and the way they behave and speak also develop to the point that they interact with humans.

"As the iPhone's poor performance is causing a wave of lawsuits against Apple not only abroad but also here. ▽ 1 news on December 28, 1717.12.28 / 1 news = I wonder why Yoon-seong News, the journalist of Yoon-seong, officially apologized for the damages of 1,000 trillion won in the U.S. and the performance of Apple on July 8. Apple's "" Back Book Apple""is a move designed to win the upper hand in an astronomical amount of 1,000 trillion won.Apple said on its official Web site on Tuesday (local time) that it "" believes (via battery gate) its customers are disappointed "" and "" We apologize. "" It has been eight days since the government admitted that it reduced battery performance through software updates on July 20.Apple apologized today and said it "" intentionally did not attempt to shorten the life of any product, "" adding, "" It was not the software update that lowered battery performance to increase sales. ""Then, iPhone users began doubting Apple's motives. Above all, he noted the point of apology. Consumers are getting worse, angry that the much-long iPhone's ' battery photolith ' was not a suspect, as Apple kept its mouth shut and then filed a collective suit.Unlike South Korea, the United States has a punitive damages package. If the accused's actions in the civil court are malicious or antisocial, they are seeking far greater damages than they really are. Apple has claimed 999.9 billion dollars in damages (approximately 1072 trillion won) in damages from the case. The claim is way over the $ 900 billion aggregate value of Apple's all-time record.U.S. consumers claim Apple's failure to warn them of intentional degradation is a "" scam "" or "" scam. "" By intentionally reducing the performance of the iPhone without telling consumers, it is a loss of property by deception.This will be a key issue in the future court battle. Lawyers for the plaintiffs indicate Apple has no intention of deliberately alerting them to a "" degradation "" as a "" catch-up "" to increase sales.If fraud is proven, Apple must throw up its astronomical compensation. Apple, therefore, intends to make an apology for itself before going to court. America, unlike Korea, is subject to punitive damages, so an apology can affect the trial, said a Korean lawyer who is qualified to practice law.Apple was sued in 2013 for collective action after it deliberately denied customers ' demands to repair failed iPhones 3 and iPod Touch under warranty. Apple then closed the case with an agreement of $ 53 million. Even in a lawsuit by the so-called Antennagate Group that says holding a certain part of the product prevents reception, Apple has compensated $ 15.00 per iPhone 4 user.Apple's announcement to replace the battery in question with free of charge in issuing the apology letter has also received criticism from consumers. Apple announced it would replace the iPhone battery in question for $ 29 by the end of next year. As if to encourage others to pay more than $ 79 off, the price was $ 50 off. "" Apple CEO Tim Cook has received more than 100 billion won in compensation, which has drawn criticism for him again. In FY2007 (Oct-September 2016), Cook received a salary of $ 3.06 million, a bonus of $ 9.93 million and a stock of approximately $ 102.92 million (i.e., a bonus). That's more than 50 percent higher than last year : "" We want our customers to use the iPhone for as long as possible and contrary to Apple's desire, lawsuits worldwide provide Apple with damages.

According to a report by CBS on July 29 (local time), the annual New Year's Eve event is being canceled one after another with the eastern part of the country facing a cold below - 30 degrees. This year's events were highly planned by the authorities to celebrate the 150th anniversary of their founding, but they are changing their plans in the cold weather.

Ottawa is expected to have a severe cold snap with its temperature falling to minus 30 degrees before and after the event is scheduled for July 31. However, the city government plans to go ahead with fireworks on New Year's Eve. Toronto, Canada's largest city, announced that it planned to reduce its 150th anniversary celebration and the New Year festival that was to be held at Nathan Phillips Square. The city government originally planned various events, such as musical performances, fireworks and outdoor skating, but explained that it would shorten the time and scale. Toronto will experience freezing temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius during the weekend, the Environment Ministry said. In addition, Charlottown called off the game and replaced it with an indoor event, according to the broadcasting.

Reuters quoted two high-ranking European security officials on July 29 (local time) and reported that Russian ships shipped and shipped crude oil from Russia in October to November were shipped with oil. Russian vessels are smuggling Russian fuel out of Russian ports in the Russian Far East this year, officials said, as Russian vessels transferred petrochemicals to North Korean vessels. Russia, however, has violated the sanctions of the U.N. Security Council. Another official confirmed that Russian ships are providing life lines to North Korea, confirming the deal between Russia and North Korea. However, he added that there is no evidence that the Russian government was involved in the process. The two officials quoted naval intelligence and satellite images of ships operating in the Russian Far East Harbor area to make such a breakthrough.

"Ahn Hee-jung, to see leadership away from the weight want to be in effect Seoul, Gyeonggi Province Governor Lee Jaemyeong aiming for Park Won-soon, a third-term winner in the Hong Joon-pyo, the challenges of life and death to integration, Ahn Cheol-soo.A decisive move will by Yoo Seung-min, Korea and tk the struggle for existence, rival presidential candidate, 19 runners who drank a bitter cup and called on in the presidential election six New Year's fortune fate again.And take on. The stage is June 13, 2018 local elections. Some of those who were forced to leave the election for the second term have returned to central politics early, and others are set to focus on consolidating their position as the next runner on stepping stone on the ground of the regional election. Whether he runs for the team or he tries to support them from behind, or tries to win the local election for Jagang, the candidate's political break point will be his success. Ahn Hee-jung, South Chungcheong Province Governor, told reporters recently, "" I want to finish my term as governor by June 30 next year. "" This implies that he will not challenge for a third term in the South Chungcheong Province and seek re-election for the National Assembly in the first half of next year. After finishing his post, I would like to study diplomatic issues surrounding the Korean Peninsula, which is surrounded by the four powers, Ahn said. Politicians are now predicting that Ahn will run directly for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in August next year. Democratic Party chinmun (a Moon Jae-in) a key system “Moon Jae-in by 2017, 2018 is a leap of innovation in government machine”, and said, a party and the reliably guide the relationship between the ruling party.Ahn is the right man, "" he said. If Ahn leads the general elections to victory in the 21st general elections in 2020 by becoming the leader of the party, the road to the next presidential election could become solid. Many view it as part of the lecture on foreign affairs, national security, and the presidency. However, some worry that if the ruling party's chairman is outside the National Assembly, his role could be limited. Because of this, many of Ahn's aides advise, "" Let's start with the distribution of gold. "" Lee Jae-myung, the mayor of Seongnam City, decided on a political path early on after the presidential election. It is a challenge to the governor in the local elections next year. It is a strategy to increase the weight class from the head of a basic organization to the head of a regional organization. Mayor Lee has shown his ideas from time to time through social networking services and has engaged in a six-month debate with incumbent Governor Nam Kyung-pil over the formation of a quasI-public system on buses in Gyeonggi Province. Lee's strong point is that he is popular with the public, including his regular appearance on a terrestrial entertainment program this year. However, some analyze that the weak support base within the party may make it difficult to predict the outcome of an organized fight in the nomination race. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, who withdrew his bid to run for the presidency as a presidential candidate of the Democratic Party during the presidential election, virtually confirmed his intent to run for the third term. Are the rival groups of the same party saying, Do they change phones because their phones are out of order these days? We can change the latest model, he said. There were calls for a downward (challenge by the governor of South Gyeongsang) or a reservicement of the National Assembly, but Park refused. Park's scenario is to challenge for the next presidential election with the power after his third term is successful. Still, the question remains of how to overcome the shaky base of the party that has been tackled in the last presidential election and the lack of charisma as a public politician. Mayor Kim Joo-myung said, After the 2011 election, the influence of traction in Seoul, which led to victory in the 2014 local elections, the 2016 general elections and the 2017 presidential election, will definitely be evaluated. Hong Joon-pyo, Whose son six regional objective, Hong Joon-pyo = the last presidential election, "" Korea representative, 7, 3 at a convention free Hong Joon-pyo said, "" collapse of a (24.0 percent of the vote), a conservative again.We will up and made a comeback. The biggest task before Hong, who claims to be the center of conservative re-building, is next year's local elections. Among the nation`s 17 largest organizations, six are currently in charge of the Korea Freedom Party, including Incheon, Busan, Daegu, Ulsan, North and South Gyeongsang provinces. Hong vowed to resign if he fails to defend the six sites. But the situation is not easy, as it is suffering from a "" shortage of people. "" Busan and South Gyeongsang Province, the areas that must be guarded, are no exceptions. Hong Jung-wook, a former lawmaker of the National Assembly, expressed his intention to step down as a candidate for the post of Seoul mayor. Some analyze that if Hong bears significant results despite such a situation, he will become a firm foothold for the conservative camp. Hong, who is chairman of the committee Kim Yong-tae and the Presidential Committee on Local Elections, has launched an early start to the local elections. Ahn Cheol-soo ◆ Achieving integration, Ahn Cheol-soo = 5, 8 and 9 presidential election, you're going to spend it all in the 27 national convention from running for the three months, Uidang-myeon Ahn Cheol-soo people to return to the representative of the ‘a clear-cut opposition party’ gichiro the party.Been attempting to improve health. Nevertheless, with no sign of a rebound in the one-digit approval rating, Ahn's card has consolidated with the right party. Ahn has been struggling to win the battle under the slogan of "" resignation of the leadership if the nation fails to unify. "" Ahn also did not rule out the possibility of running directly in the local elections. In a radio interview on July 27, he said, I will do anything if the party asks me to do to win the local elections after unification. But the fire is now on how to get over the turbulence that has even led to the Civil War. As anti-unification groups and the ruling party have been engaged in a battle, Ahn's political leadership has been shaken a lot. The ruling “If the new leadership is get good grades in local elections, Ahn Cheol-soo will receive a new understanding” is a party source said. Yoo Seung-min Whose son ‘the tk’ Yoo Seung-min of its members the party in negotiation group, status, Yoo Seung-min of losing to break through the crisis with the integration of the party of the people is a political party leaders.Trying. Rhyu plans to integrate with the people to form a third party base and establish himself as the new conservative center in the mid-to-distance, moving beyond the GNP. The first major election for Rhyu is in the midst of this crisis. Rhyu, in particular, must face the GNP for the Daegu and North Gyeongsang provinces (TK) deficit, the conservative camp`s stronghold. Despite rumors that Yoo himself will resign as Seoul mayor, the only reason why Yoo is making a fuss is because of the "" TK deficit. "" Rhyu recently appeared on a show and stressed that TK is a very important place to play, adding, We will have a showdown with the Korea Party. However, if he fails to make rapid progress in the TK election, contrary to his wishes, the party's foundation will inevitably shake again. If the party and the party of the people succeed in consolidating, the presence and status of the party can become the challenge, too, hidden by Ahn. Politicians are expected to make a notable appearance in the local elections next year before the elections of Chummiae, Min-byung-Doo, Kim Seong-tae and Shim Jae-chul. First of all, the ruling party head Choo Mi-ae, the fisherman's chief executive officer at the head of the campaign, and floor leader Kim Seong-tae of the main opposition Grand National Party, who leads the party`s floor leaders, were born in 1958. Min Byung-doo (DP), who announced his intention to run for Seoul mayor, Shim Jae-cheol (Korea Party), vice chairman of the National Assembly, and Park Nam-choon (Democratic Party), who is considered as the candidate of the Incheon mayor's office, are both of Seoul. In the sense that the ups and downs of modern history, such as industrialization and democratization, ' tti 58 nyeon . ' ' is used as a unique noun in Korean society. They were born in the aftermath of the Korean War, when the baby boom was at its peak. Because of the high numbers, he had to study in the same classroom as bean sprouts when he was young, and the price of real estate soared (late 1980s) when he married. When he turned 30, he experienced a democratic uprising in June of 1987, the IMF financial crisis in 1997, and many ups and downs in life. Politicians found the ' tight generation ' between the 4th and 19th generations and the 86 generations (class of 1980s + 60 years). However, when the elder generation retired, the Year 58 dogs showed their true colors and they are naturally emerging as major figures in the local elections next year.

"Justice Minister Bahk Sang-kee announces Thursday a special amnesty for the 2018 New Year at the government office of Seoul's Seoulcheong. Two model women who were brought into China with two new-size children also took advantage of a bag of Chinese children and put it in a supermarket bag in Geumcheon, Seoul, on November 22 last year. It was 8,900 won altogether. Mr. Lee was soon captured by the police and sent to trial. He was charged with special theft. The problem was that he broke into the supermarket's shutter door with a hammer in the middle of the night. The sentence of recommendation on penalty criteria was eight months to one year and six months in jail. The court sentenced to eight months in jail. We failed to reach an agreement with the victim, but we took into consideration the small amount of the stolen goods, the lack of a history of punishment and punishment immediately after the crime. Lee did not appeal, and his sentence of eight months in jail was confirmed. He was included in the list of those who received special amnesty as announced by the government on July 29. He was classified as a livelihood thief. Lee, who is in jail for esophageal cancer, is entitled to a reduction of half of her remaining term (4 months and 7 days). The incumbent government explained that it decided to impose a livelihood tax on the working class and tried to find a case like Lee. Cheong Wa Dae described it as "" an amnesty for Jean Valjean. "" The three offenders who received less than one million won in damages, 10 elderly and severely ill patients, and foreigners who were first offenders received special amnesty or reduction in damages. Among those convicted of stealing from the life sentence, Lee (21) was sentenced to one year in jail after stealing two king crab from a seafood restaurant aquarium, and Kwang-mo (39, female) was sentenced to 50,000 won in jail. Lee said, "" The amnesty allowed one half of the remaining jail terms to be reduced, and Kwak received an exemption from jail on July 27. The ministry explained that it wanted to provide people with a chance to recover their lives by focusing on property crimes, which are relatively minor in nature. Among those who carry children to jail, the amnesty list includes two women who have good manners and who have little risk of repeat offenders. Han, 28, gave birth to a baby in jail after being sentenced to one year and two months in jail for embezzling 100 million won. The Justice Ministry has excused the remaining four months and 18 days of execution, taking into consideration Han`s willingness to live with his parents after being released from prison and raise his current seven-month-old daughter. Two inmates who accidentally committed crimes after suffering constant domestic violence were also listed. Lee (53) is sentenced to four years in jail for causing her husband, who was attacked by violence for 30 years, to die by using a cushion against her drunk husband. In consideration for the petition by the bereaved family, they will be released on July 30 after nine months and eight days of probation. Meanwhile, some Cheong Wa Dae officials reacted angrily to what they described as "" especially those who were convicted unfairly, "" referring to the offenders who committed the crime. The court could have falsely accused them of being unjust jail terms, judging comprehensively on the legal provisions applied to the accused at the time, their attitude toward the trial and past criminal record.Ji Ho-il, reporter of Kakao Friends blue51@kmib.co.kr[ [Facebook] [Newsroom whirring!)]"
"[Donga Ilbo Cover Story] [Toyopan Guide-Leave Studies] I lost a friend during the East Japan earthquake. I could not tell what to do with the sorrow, so I had to spend every day in agony. And when my place was rocked by an earthquake, I thought, ' If I were him, I wouldn't have survived. ' When the emergency hit, he realized that he had no idea how to survive.It is a preface to the book "" How to Survive Our Family Accident "" published last month. Didn't people who were deeply saddened by the fire at the sports center in Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province, which killed 29 people? As the owners of the building were arrested and the managers charged, attention was raised to the fact that the owners and their managers who had regarded the disaster as someone else's business. "" Security is all about concern after all, "" experts agree. Even though the government has set up a new disaster prevention facility and adjusted the system, citizens should pay more attention at the scene. The Dong-A Ilbo obtained advice from six professors who attended the fire department to learn how to prepare for and evacuate.　　○ Panic when a fire breaks out … No harm can come after a warning. So many people are in panic. Forget what they used to know. When disaster strikes, people are simplified. It is difficult to read the complexity. That is why as short and intuitive an evacuation information as possible is needed. Guidance or sign on fire escape methods should be delivered in a simpler form of words than sentences. Broadcast is better than the sentence "" Never use elevators and use stairs. "" The location of the fire and the information about escape are also better. The fire at the shopping center attached to Dongtan Metapolis in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province, in February of this year is a bad example. At that time, the management company stopped the fire alarms and the inducements, but turned them on again right after the fire broke out. People inside the building also testified, We had to evacuate before an announcement and a siren came. Four people were killed and 100 others were taken to hospital after drinking toxic gas. The best thing to do is to have people in the building see for themselves where the fire is. Only then can they figure out the proper route to escape. However, it is difficult for people in the public buildings or the basement floor to grasp the fire. Korean national university professor Kim Yoo-sik said, The first role in evacuation is played by building officials. Managers should never do anything wrong, such as turn off sprinklers, paying attention to safety. 　　○ We should start with the evacuation facilities of our home or company in February last year, when an apartment in Haeundae-gu, Busan caught fire. People who could not escape from the fire gate, which started around 5 a.m., evacuated to the veranda. They were able to break through the wall of the veranda and take refuge in the neighborhood. The fire was put out in about 20 minutes by the inside of the apartment and no lives were lost. The "" lightweight partition "" (emergency exit of apartments) saved the family's lives. The installation began according to the regulations on housing construction that were revised in 1992. Starting in 2005, it was mandatory to install fire escape areas or lightweight partitions. It is most likely that apartments built in 1992-2005 have lightweight partitions. It is made of thin plaster, which makes a sound of "" chomping "" when touched. Some buildings have signs of emergency exits built by local governments or distributed by themselves. Even though it has been mandatory for its installation for more than 10 years, many people still do not know how to use it. It must be installed in a building with three to ten floors, such as an apartment or a villa in 2006. The stronger consists of rings and belts that can be hung on the supports. Last resort when stairs are not available. It also has a single stage. You should check in advance what kind of strangler is installed in your office or home. Since it may be difficult to use the facilities of the elderly or children, it is best to experience the area through the fire safety experience center, if possible. It is also important to check whether automatic closures are properly installed in the fire doors connected to the emergency stairs of the building. In some cases, the door stoppers are installed or the door stoppers are intended to be inoperative due to ventilation or frustration. If a fire door is opened, it can cause a fire to set off much faster, which is dangerous.　　○ The first thing that matters is the speed, which is recommended by the fire department professors, that the damage be minimized when the fire is carried out at the initial stage of the fire. According to the National Action Guide at the Fire Administration, first people who see a fire should shout "" Fire "" and inform others. You should also press the alarm bell installed on nearby fire hydrant. It is also important to know the fire. Listen to the broadcast, etc. coming out of the building and check the location of the exit and the guidance lights quickly. If it is impossible to escape to the emergency exit, do not panic. "" The building is designed with a principle of safe failure that enables bi-directional evacuations, "" said Jeong Ki-shin, a professor at Semyung University in Seoul. We should not give up on the fact that there is another emergency exit. In a fire situation, smoke is as deadly as fire. According to the National Fire Information Center of the Small and Medium Fire Administration, 306 people died in fires last year, of whom 187 percent died from smoke and inhalation of toxic gas. Generally, the higher the gas concentration, the more black smoke is produced. If you are full of black smoke, don't try too hard. Professor Kim said, Even though the passages are full of toxic fumes, we can reduce the ` extremely time ` to survive when we open the door to live. If it is difficult to escape from the toxic fumes, it is right to wait for rescue without opening the door. It is better to wet clothes to block the doors and wait for rescue so that smoke can not enter the room. Some U.S. manuals even tell people to close the doors of doors, turn on the water, and wait for rescue in the bathroom, said Kong Ha-seong, a fire department professor. 　　○ Lower body Evacuation…White the glass is sheltering from the corner in smoke, it should be carried out with a wet towel, etc. placed on its nose and moved to a lower position. This is also to avoid the risk of suffocation. Normally the smoke is from the ceiling, and the cleanest air is about 30-60 cm above the floor. If you need to pass the fire, cover your body and face with a blanket or a few towels and wet them. If you need to open the door without knowing what is going on outside, touch the door handle slightly, such as bringing the back of your hand. If the handle is hot, it is advisable to look for another way out. Because the fire could have spread to the front of the door. If you want to evacuate from the fire area, you must close the door again. Do not let the fire run or smoke run out. When you need to break through the glass, you should hit the lower corner rather than the center. It is hard to break in the middle of all the strength of the glass. It is better to break glass and make sure that corners are well organized so that no additional injuries are reported.Kwon Ki-beom, reporter of kaki@donga.com, Choi Ji-seon and Kim Eun-ji : "" The Dong-A Ilbo's exclusive / Dong-A Ilbo's official Facebook and Facebook's decision on how to re-distribute elementary news (click!) has suddenly been banned by ⓒ Dong A & Donga.I picked up a freshman one month ago and sent it to you by post.Reports from reporter Seo Yoo Jung.◀ Report An admission process was held last month at a private elementary school in Seoul that is over 50 years old.Although the recruitment process went smoothly, the school suddenly announced that it would close after one month.I will close the school at the end of February next year.[Parents] : "" Most people wonder what happened.

Some say SK Group is related to the project in the Middle East because it was the meeting that took place right before Lim's recent visit to the United Arab Emirates, a controversial project outside and outside of politics. First of all, Cheong Wa Dae and SK Group have denied it with one voice. In other words, it has nothing to do with Lim's visit to the UAE. SK Group officials told Yonhap News Agency on July 30 that Chairman Choi asked Cheong Wa Dae to cooperate on the company`s project in the UAE, when some media outlets reported that it was possible to disrupt the project, but there was no denial about it. We understand many businesses are operating in the Middle East, but we don`t see any larger ones being carried out in the UAE, the official reiterated.

According to the International Postal Service and the International Postal Logistics Center on July 30, 162 containers for air freight (ULD) have been unloaded from the cargo plane at Incheon International Airport. When cargo planes from abroad arrive at the airport, the International Postal Service, the customs office of Incheon headquarters, will proceed with the customs clearance process before X-rays. The Korea Post, the Korea Post, and the Seoul Regional Communications Office will then receive and deliver the products to customers. Customs clearance is a rule on the day, and parcels must be checked in for delivery at the latest. However, customs clearance has been delayed due to a lack of coordination with the nation's rapidly growing shipments at the end of the year. Some of the items ordered by Korean fastballs (direct purchase) are still likely to be on the reservation site during the Chinese mining holiday (November 11) and Black Friday (November 24). If you look at the status of container storage at Incheon International Airport's moorings, 216 containers were piled up between July 13 and 27. Customs officials worked hard until late at night for the last two days, but only cleared 56 stores. ▽ Incheon Airport = International postal parcel arrived in Korea by freight plane, but due to delayed customs clearance, it is piled up at the Incheon International Airport cargo terminal's moorings.

At the end of this year, items shipped from the United States, China, Europe, and Oceania have increased by 10-15 percent. As the daily traffic volume is estimated to range from 55,000 to 60,000, it is unlikely that it will be easy for the nation to solve the congestion of overseas goods. mania@newsis.com> (Yonhap news agency) reporter Kim Jae-hong : On August 29, on the 11th floor of an apartment building in Busan, A (55), who was shaking a blanket, crashed into a flower bed.
