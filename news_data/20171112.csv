"Ukrainian combat robot [U.S. EPA = picture of combined news material] prohibited? How far is your ship?"" No Robot Murder Decision, "" said Jang Jae-jae, a reporter at Yonhap news agency, "" The international community is engaged in a serious debate over the issue of artificial intelligence killing tools, or killer robots. AFP reported on July 12 (local time) that the subject of killer robots will be discussed at the CCW (Convention on the Prohibition of Certain Conventional Weapons) meeting in Geneva on July 13. It is the first time that the United Nations has discussed the effectiveness and side effects of weapons that can be operated by themselves with artificial intelligence. Because of the concept of effective killing on machines, killer robots have raised a variety of controversies, ranging from fear of exploitation to the terminal fear that robots will dominate the world. Civic activists worry that killer robots will cause huge damage to innocent civilians. They warn that if the killer robots fall into the hands of dictators or terrorists, or are hacked, large-scale disasters can occur. High-tech experts in artificial intelligence research are also showing clear opposition. Around 100 businessmen including Tesla's Illon Musk and Mustafa Sulaiman of Google Deepmind sent a letter to the United Nations last August requesting the ban of killer robots. Despite growing concerns, banning killer robots is not likely to be discussed immediately at the U.N. conference. It is also unlikely that a contract will be drawn up to regulate devices similar to those of killer robots, let alone discussion on banning them. We are only at the start, said Aman Dipgil, India's disarmament ambassador who heads the meeting. It is easy to ban with one stroke of the knife, but it`s unwise to jump to the conclusion of a very complicated problem, added Jin. Civic groups and high-tech companies will also attend the conference to discuss ways to better understand the types of killer robots. The key argument against killer robots is an uncompromising proposition that the decision to kill or destroy should ultimately be made human. Civic group Campaign to Stop Killer Robots argues that killer robots are illegal in their concept. Because a computer can not be a war criminal suspect, any machine that is entered to determine individual attacks on the computer logic system is illegal. As for this, Ambassador Gill stated, "" We share the consensus that life-and-death decisions are human responsibility. "" He said, "" but the artificial intelligence of the human bank that prevents deadly weapons crimes from being claimed is a problem. "" The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), authorized to protect the International humanitarian law, has agreed to impose limitations without calling for a ban on killer robots. `` It is our basic policy that machines can not apply the law and leave their legal decisions to the machine, '' said Neal Davidson of the ICRC's military division. Davison pointed out the nature of the killer robots, depending on the time and location of attack. For example, if the machines were programmed to attack enemy targets that were detected in the same place for hours, it would have to be controversial. `` If you operate such a machine with a certain level of predictability and uncertainty, then you start to experience problems in compliance, '' Davidson explained. Since extensive discussion on artificial intelligence was made when talking about killer robots, the CCW could not be able to set the subject of urgent issues before the U.N. conference, and could be subject to discussion. jangje@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting latest trends (click!), even raising suspicions of paying overtime for an online practice program … After reporting to the Seoul National University Medical Center, investigate the movements of residents and prepare measures to deal with the issue during the night of the ` Hallim Hospital `. The Ministry of Health and Welfare, the responsible ministry, called on the hospital industry to make a midnight effort. According to the civic group Professional Baseball Organization on July 12, the first group has been complaining about the talent show Seongsim Hospital since opening of its Kakao Talk Open chat room on July 1. Park Jeom-kyu, 119, chief of staff at the office, said, "" Kakao Talk alone causes hundreds of complaints a day, and official e-mails received 44 inquiries per day. "" The article that the hospital had the nurses practice until 10 p.m. until 11 p.m. after their day shift began three weeks before the athletic event, was also posted in Kakao Talk's Open chat room the next morning. They even complain to new nurses about having to do with their work, such as "" Can You Dance Well "" or "" Who's the thinnest "" on their site when they're trying to recruit someone to cast themselves for an organ contest. Seongsim Hospital claims it forces nurses to appear in its October Foundation Day, where they dress up in long-again-agent hours, and a sexy dance is being staged. Now, former and present nurses at Sung Shim Hospital are also having issues with "" paying off overtime. "" They say that they could not leave the office on time while preparing to show off their organs, but the hospital failed to provide them with any overtime payment. Kwon Doo-seop, an adviser at the office, said, We also have a precedent of looking at overtime as a work day, adding, We have to invest our money in formal events. Lawyer Yoon Ji-young also said, "" Because you're not obligated to attend Seongsim Hospital because you're not voluntary, you should give an overtime payment. "" "" The company made it clear that the staff would plan and order. "" It is not the only suspicions that Seongsim Hospital has paid overtime. Some say participants at video conferencing, which is to be held every Tuesday at 7:00 a.m., were also not given overtime. As 30 to 40 teams including medical team, administrative team, and hospital ward management team go through this meeting, the meeting is held to present recommendations for the advancement of the hospital to key guardians. Some staff members at Seongsim Hospital claimed that they tended to have representatives from each team who attended video conferences based on their "" appearances. "" There are even rumors that pregnant nurses were forced to work at night. Regarding the allegation, Seongsim Hospital explained, "" We will seek measures to prevent any further occurrence of controversial issues and internal investigation. "" We have yet to answer any questions as we are still investigating the relationship, said a Sung Shim Hospital official, saying, We have yet to answer any overtime payment due to the talent show. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the responsible ministry, requested that the hospital industry make a "" self-cleaning effort. "" Lee Ki-il, director of the Health and Welfare Ministry's health policy, sent an official letter to the Korean Hospital Association on July 12, saying, "" Let's call the nurses a hospital event and make sure that the hospitals don't show off their past wrongdoings. "" The ministry will also recommend that nurses be treated personally as a recommendation in a comprehensive package of measures to supply and receive nurses at the end of this month. This explains that it is not the government's own responsibility to investigate the incident from within the hospital foundations, but as some say, "" The government is too passive, "" the government has emerged as an overly passive problem and needs to be investigated actively.Nurse's talent show during her own athletic event.

"【 Seoul = New Sist 】 Chinese Liberation Day, "" Black Army Day "" began at midnight on July 11, while China's biggest e-commerce event is starting at Albava. Alivaba Shopping Galasho is being held at the Sanghaifudong Mercedes Benz Arena the night before. (Source : Baidu) Seoul = Newsis and Lee Ji-ye : Alibaba Guangdae Record (People's Day), or Black Friday, was posted at a record high of 2.8 billion won during the day. Alizila, an al-Babar news site, reported sales of 168.69 billion yuan in the last 24 hours with the mining system starting at midnight. The New York Times reported that sales were over 40 percent higher than they were last year. China's mining system has already had more sales than America's Thanksgiving shopping scene, Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. Sales records are also being broken faster. Gwang-gun`s deal broke the one-billion yuan (approximately 168.2 billion won) mark in only 28 seconds after the event began. Last year, it took 52 seconds to reach the 1 billion yuan. November 11 is Single Day in China. On this day, especially, youths who are not paired up with each other enjoy blind dates, parties, and gift exchanges. China's largest e-commerce company, Ali Baba launched a massive discount event for single people through its subsidiary T Mall in 2009 to mark the mining system. It is a story of how the mining system was transformed into the biggest shopping day in China. Optical service is used as a window to sell their products by companies from each country. Forty percent of the products sold in the mining system are foreign, not Chinese. ez@newsis.comWhile the attention of the market is focused on popular areas such as Seoul, unpopular areas in the Seoul Metropolitan area and provinces are getting worse as ‘ blue medicine ’ complexes grow.As the volume of apartments has been announced since the end of the year, management is needed in advance.According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport and related industries, the number of unsold houses nationwide stood at 54,420 as of the end of September, a 2.4 percent increase from the previous month (53,130).Unsold sales figures nationwide decreased from March to August of this year, but after five months, the numbers of unsold goods have dropped and have increased. By region, unsold apartments in the Seoul metropolitan area rose 6.1 percent to 11,113 units last month, while unsold homes in the provinces increased by 1.6 percent to 41,109 units, up 0.4 percent from the previous month. Housing Demand is being frustrated as various regulations on real estate and finance were poured on real estate, such as the August 2 Real Estate Measures and the October 24 Household Loan Measures. However, the polarization is becoming more popular in Seoul, where the location is good and the future value is high, and the non-processing areas are being ignored. Last month, all four apartments in Seoul subscribed for shares, closing the books within the first place. In some complexes, the competition rate for the first round of applications was higher than two digits, which led to a fierce competition among applicants.However, the temperature difference was clear due to a series of sub-contractions in the Seoul Metropolitan area and outside the provinces.Ansung Gyeongdong Merbil, which was sold in Ansung-do, was deficient because it recruited 317 households but none applied. Sunchang Mirchae, a candidate for Sunchang County, North Jeolla Province, had not applied for first place in its list of 75 households and had to be satisfied with receiving one person from second place.A boom in sales in certain areas, including Seoul, and a focus on them, could create an illusion that all markets are in good shape, industry watchers say, a comprehensive understanding of the market as a whole is needed.Meanwhile, construction companies are pumping out their final sales volume before enforcing stricter regulations next year. According to the real estate information company, the total number of apartments this month was 60,47, 50.4 percent higher than the same period last year (39,922). In addition, as the volume of apartments to be sold and sold in the run-up to and after 2015, which was booming in the housing market, is set to enter the market, the volume of apartments will be transferred to the market.About 379,000 apartments nationwide moved in this year, up 30 percent from 293,000 last year. Next year, the nation's largest ever residential area of 443,000 households will start moving in. It is the first time that the volume of apartments has exceeded 400,000. It is about twice the annual occupancy rate of 240,000 households during the last five years (2012-2016).Industry watchers say the turnaround in the selling spree could signal a huge unsold bomb, adding, We need to be over-provided, regulated, and rate hikes to take up the slack in advance."

What Kim said was false. Around 3:00 a.m. on July 5, Tsutima was found by a police search team, stone-death in a remote hill in Yeongyang-gun, North Gyeongsang Province. The suspect, identified as Kim, had belatedly turned himself in to the Ansung Police Station. He testified that he killed her because he was unable to commit sexual assault. Samrit (56), the father of Tsutima, could not believe the sad news that flew from Korea. It was a bolt from the blue Thai media reported the murder of Tsutima as the main news. Samrit arrived in Korea in a hurry on July 9. "" I was a good daughter who helped out at home with farming after finishing middle school. Eleven years ago, when I said I would go to work in Korea to support my family, I always felt sorry and grateful. I used to make video calls every day. "" But she told me she hadn't called in a few days since she called on October 31 and that she had been disconnected from work. "" I was very concerned about my anxiety. But a friend of my daughter in Korea told me the news.… I'm so sorry. Why did this happen to my daughter .... "" He couldn't relate to it properly. Tsutima has a daughter with her boyfriend, who she broke up with years ago. The 13-year-old daughter has come to Korea only twice to see her mother. On July 11, Samrit the father went to Gyeongbuk antelope, where his daughter was found and buried. In order to establish the exact cause of death, the poor farmer's father only shed tears in front of the body of his daughter, who had completed an autopsy at the National Institute of Scientific Investigation. His closed face was the same as he was 11 years ago when he left home, but his body was cold. The Thai daily Thairas The title was given : "" A Thai woman is horribly murdered in the country of Kimchi. "" Officials of migrant workers ’ groups said that the policy of illegal immigrants based on crackdown or deportation that ignored the plight of unregistered foreigners and the reality of the labor market's workforce demand was not related to the tragedy of Chutima. The detection of illegal residency is considered deportation, which means that we have to make an extravagant choice to avoid cracking down on. According to monthly reports by the Immigration and Foreign Policy Bureau, the number of "" illegal aliens "" in Korea reached 235,955 as of the end of September. The majority of them are unregistered migrant workers whose visas expired because they had expired. "" Many Koreans still look down on migrant workers, and especially in the workplace, "" said Han Sang-hoon, an activist at the Hwaseong migrant worker's shelter in Gyeonggi Province who helped with the tire interpretation by Samrit. Reflecting the fact that there are already many unregistered migrant workers in the country, it is urgent to change the policy to ease and accept their stay conditions, he stressed. "" Our immigration law has rules and orders to induce people to leave the country voluntarily, but they are not in good working order, "" said Cho Young-kwan, a lawyer at the Immigration and Nationality Center. As they were deported immediately after being cracked down, unregistered foreigners who did not have permission to stay in the country were forced to submit a police crackdown and they could not resist the threat of reporting despite unreasonable requests from nearby. In other words, the government needs to provide a policy that provides a way to expel people if they stay beyond the expiration date despite a recommendation or order to leave the country. U.S. President Barack Obama for example, former president, in 2014, at least five years of illegal immigrants living in the United States citizenship or legal residents, a mandated.Delay the deportation if their parents with children and a clean record and paying taxes and legally, jobs and get conditional permanent residency to the immigration reform.Previously conducted by executive order. Cho said, "" Even if we do not deal with unregistered and illegal immigrants, we can provide them with a visa by providing them with a schedule to leave the country as faithfully as possible, not directly expelling them, or by providing them with a visa. "" He added that "" Immigration is not a way to keep a lid on and kick a person out, but a way to bring foreigners in vulnerable positions into the law, "" preventing foreign workers from violating human rights.

A more meaningful achievement to assess at the summit is to increase communication and cooperation to resolve the North Korea`s nuclear weapons program, the two countries ` largest trade agreement. The two leaders agreed at the meeting that it is necessary to keep the current security situation on the Korean Peninsula in a stable manner and agreed to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue peacefully through dialogue.

The two countries agreed to step up strategic dialogue on the North Korean nuclear issue and the Korean Peninsula on various levels.

"【 Seoul-News-Newsey & Lee Jong-Hee : The price of mobile phones is skyrocketing, with the price of more than one million won. As the high handset price is weighing on household communication costs, the self-sufficient system, in which consumers purchase mobile phones and telecom products separately, is becoming an alternative. According to the industry on July 12, the price of mobile phones, which was recently released, exceeded one million won and is becoming a burden on consumers. Apple's latest iPhone is especially controversial, with its high price tag. The iPhone 8 will be priced at 990,000 won for 64GB (GB) models and 1.2 million won for 256GB models. With the release date around, iPhone X will be released at a higher price. The price of the iPhone X in Korea is 140,000 won for 64GB model and 1,630,000 won for 256GB model. Korean mobile phones are also priced at 1 million won for flagship models. Samsung Electronics ' Galaxy Note 8 was the most expensive smartphone of all time. It is set at 109,500 won for 64GB models and 125,400 won for 256GB models. LG Electronics ' Flagship model (64GB) is priced at 940,930 won. The 30-plus ES30, with 128 GB capacity, costs 998,880 won. Analysts say the domestic mobile handset market has become more expensive, surpassing one million won. Mobile research company Atlars Research & Consulting reported that last year, the domestic handset market saw a 7.3 percent share of the handset sales reached between 400,000 and 800,000 won. The sale of expensive handsets, which costs more than 800,000 won, exceeded 60 percent. Ultimately, expensive handsets that consumers purchase operate as the main causes of household communication costs. Last year, the analysis of service specific rates by Green Consumer Federation (CSU) showed that 21.2 % of installment payments for handsets were made by mobile service providers. Communication service charges were 54.6 percent. The phone and data rates were only half. Rather, the percentage of terminals other than those related to pure communication fees was higher. As a result, it is rapidly becoming an alternative to the full self supporting system of the terminal. The self-sufficient system allows consumers to buy a cellular phone at an average electronics store and then subscribe to the mobile phone service provider as if they were purchasing TVs or computers. Currently, the market is selling and providing the customers with the terminal and communication service together through the market of the mobile service provider, but when the terminal's fully self-contained system is adopted, the mobile operators sell the communication service only. The handsets will be sold only by manufacturers ` cars and handset retailers such as Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics. That is, the market for handsets and the products for mobile phones are completely separate. Through this, it is predicted that the price of the terminal can be decreased naturally due to competition of products between handset companies and mobile phone companies. There is also keen public interest in introducing the system. Dubull Rep. Park Hong-keun of the U.S. Permit-General of Fisheries last month commissioned an opinion poll group Mango R&D ; and found that ' five out of ten thousand people who answered their cell phones in favor using the ' opinion polls ' on July 21 through September 9. The government has launched an open disclosure process to solve the problem, boosted by public opinion seeking to lower the communication costs. The government launched the Household Communications Cost Policy Council as part of its measures to reduce communication costs on July 10 and began its activities for 100. It intends to establish mid - to long-term communication policies by collecting the voices of various stakeholders. The first agenda to be discussed by the council is the terminal's complete self-sufficiency system. After the first meeting on July 10, Chairman Kang Byung-min of the committee told reporters, I think we will discuss how to operate the consultative body in the future, and which agenda to discuss entirely on the self-supplying agenda. However, there are still many tasks left. The devices are fully self-contained and have a clear stake in the company as a positive, neutral and negative interests of the handset makers. It would be nice to meet various stakeholders and listen to them, but on the contrary, it would be difficult to reach an agreement, said an official of the industry who said, "" Regardless of the relationship, it is necessary to reduce the burden on consumers. "" 2papers@newsis.comChina, Saade, > problem does not mention [anchor] as Moon Jae-in president in Manila, Philippines, where he arrived, the ASEAN Summit. The Korea-China summit talks, which was held yesterday, reportedly had some pain. The two leaders reportedly stressed the principle of principle before sealing the THAAD missiles. I'm a reporter at Isung University in Manila.The biggest issue in the summit was the THAAD system. Contrary to expectations, the two leaders chose to take the bull by the horns by placing the THAAD issue on the table. President Xi Jinping says he opposes the deployment of the THAAD system first, and says he hopes the nation will act responsibly on the issue.Then, Moon Jae-in existing position in a ""Sade is not aimed at China."" president, stressed once again. Although the THAAD issue was remarked, the two leaders ' remarks were agreed upon on on on on July 31.Before the two countries finally wrapped up the THAAD issue, the two sides again made their respective positions clear. [Senior Presidential Secretary for National Communication] Yoon Young-chan : (Oct. 31) evaluates the statement on how to improve our relationship with the THAAD system, and the two countries have urged the restoration of exchanges and cooperation to normal orbit in all areas.] China is not likely to return to the THAAD system during the summit between China and China in December, or even after that. The Sade conflict has virtually ended with the recent Korea-China conference. Accordingly, the ASEAN Summit held during the Moon Jae-in Sade on normalization of retaliatory measures in meeting Prime Minister Li Keqiang's president and China will appear with concrete results.I'm looking forward to it.

Korean Tobacco and Tobacco Market The market is forecast to grow more rapidly as the nation's smoking rate is very high and consumer reaction rate is high for e-smoking. According to industry sources on July 12, the market share of e-smoking in the Korean tobacco market is estimated to be around 2-3 percent as of the third quarter. When it comes to November sales figures, the ice caps account for about 6 percent of the domestic cigarette market. If the rapid growth continues, the share of e-smoking will grow to 7 to 8 percent next year. Electronic cigarette makers are pulling out some smokers at the beginning of the year, but overall, the tobacco market is growing. The market will grow by an estimated 0.7 percent next year, said Hong Se-jong, an economist at Shinhan Financial Investment Institute. Considering the initial reaction of electronic cigarettes and the example of Japan, the domestic market share of electronic cigarettes is likely to grow further. In Japan, the company currently has a 12 % market share. In Japan, the company`s shares in the first quarter of last year stood at 0.8 percent, but in the first quarter of this year, they soared to 7.1 percent. This year, the company has continued to grow to 10.0 percent in the second quarter and 11.9 percent in the third. Recently, the Japanese cigarette market has been forecast to recover in terms of growth in heated electronic cigarettes such as Icos, and the total demand for electronic cigarettes has been reduced to an increasing trend, said Park Sang-jun, an economist at Kiwoom Securities Co.Whether the rise of cigarette electronic cigarettes such as Icos will continue depends on the increase in prices. At the National Assembly plenary session, a revision bill was passed to the individual excise tax law, which would raise the tax on e-smoking to 90 percent of that of ordinary cigarettes. As a result, individual excise taxes on cigarette-type electronic cigarettes will rise 403 to 529 won from 126. If the excise on cigarettes, the local education tax and the national health promotion levy are also raised to the level of 90 percent of those on general cigarettes, the tax on cigarettes will rise by more than 1,200 won. As a result, the price of electronic cigarettes, which account for 4,300 won per pack, could rise to around 5,000 won. Higher prices may put a stop to the popularity of electronic cigarettes. However, many analysts say that despite the price hikes, the growth of electronic cigarettes will continue. Local retailer KT&G ; its products can be sold at a relatively low price, outsourcing its rivals in terms of cost, such as duties and transportation. Ultimately, it is predicted that the market will grow for the time being, although the share of the market in the e-smoking market can change. Lee Kyung-shin, senior researcher at High-Investment Investment & Securities, said, "" The growth rate after the introduction of Icos is faster than in Japan. double@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"As IT, travel and start-up businesses focus on expanding their shares and Internet surfing, 8 % of leading companies said they wouldn't be able to afford to have their main 4 days ' work days off due to the introduction of the ' Four Days work week ' vitamin.

She took her 11 and 7 year old children and went all over the country this year alone. When I don't go on a trip, I meet a child who comes back from school.

In 2010, one female employee complained, "" It's hard to raise a family and take care of a child together, so give me one more day off. "" Now all employees work Monday through Thursday, and on Friday, only the manager goes to work. Although working hours decreased, management performance did not. Sales surpassed 10 billion won last year, up from 8.5 billion won in 2013. The number of employees who were 32 last year has increased to 50. Other companies have even moved on to Enesti, willing to take a pay cut.The elegant brothers who run the nation of delivery, the delivery app, delayed their arrival at work until 1:00 p.m. on Monday, 2015. She moved her time to 6 p.m. from 6:30 p.m. from March this year. The working hours of the office have been reduced from 40 hours in 2014 to 35 hours a week. The working hours are closer to 4.5 days per week than five. `` Because of the nature of the startup, I don`t have any creative idea of sitting at my desk for long, '' said an official of the elegant brothers. `` It provided time for 500 employees to get to work as a welfare. The guest app, "" Here, Doorlaya, "" also introduced the same system in April as the elegant brothers.Since its establishment in 2014, advertising agency Creative Mars has insisted on a four-day workweek. Only Mondays and Thursdays work for the company, and employees are free to work wherever they work on Fridays. "" A stronger advertising company needs to rest easy enough to come up with a good idea, "" says Creative Mars.North Gyeongsang Province took out its four-day state credit card. The new employees of the public recruitment agencies will be hired as the four-day workweek. Technopark in North Gyeongsang Province has already hired three employees who work only 32 hours a week, Monday through Thursday. Though the wage is 20 percent less than other employees, welfare and treatment are the same. Gyeongbuk Province also has or will hire employees of the Korean Studies Promotion Agency, the Korea Bio Industry Institute of North Gyeongsang Province and the Culture and Content Agency of North Kyongsang Province on July 4. We can recruit more people if we hire them on the next four days, the province said.◇ In foreign countries, settlements … Even in Korea, the four-day workweek system has been established in Europe such as Disneyland, Denmark and Sweden. In Japan, the four-day workweek has been spreading to other countries. According to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, 8 percent of Japanese companies have a four-day workweek.Companies accept the four-day workweek system because they believe it reduces working hours but does not impair productivity. The increase in work intensity on a four-day basis means that workers can eliminate so-called ' empty labor ' from wasting time chatting and surfing the Internet that has nothing to do with their work.However, experts say it is more desirable to wait and see whether or not one can settle down in Korea. It is questionable whether they can overcome the unique culture of Korean companies with long working hours. In fact, travel agencies have adopted a four-day biweekly demonstration system since August, but they recently decided to reduce the number of trips to one per month. It was difficult to respond in real time to customer requests and employees commented that they were ' tired from too much work on another day '.

If the U.S. reaffirmed its solid alliance at the third Korea-U.S. summit in Seoul on July 7, the two countries ' summit talks on the APEC agenda would collapse due to the "" THAAD : Trust in America "" issue. The biggest challenge in the past six months since the new administration was also diplomacy. North Korea was the biggest variable. Four days after the government's inauguration, the company launched a new medium and long range ballistic missile (IRMB) test and launched a "" severe advanced diet "" that was designed to test the planet Mars 12. It was literally a ' singo ' diet. Since then, North Korea has conducted an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM-level) and even conducted its sixth nuclear test in September. They hit the provocation every week.The Berlin Initiative, ambitious to announce at the beginning of its term by the new government, was simply a concept. He was ignored by North Korea for every suggestion he made, such as the military talks, reunions of separated families, and attending the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. The theory of the Korean Peninsula drivers grew into a rumor that North Korea is also going to ignore South Korea. America was also a tough nut to crack. U.S. The president is Donald Trump ‘Strong Man’ traits that would give full play. It has raised tension on the Korean Peninsula as much as North Korea, issuing statements such as "" Fire and fury, "" "" Destroy the North completely, "" and "" The suicide rocket man. "" The relationship between Korea and China was worse. After the deployment of the THAAD missiles, the storm immediately led to massive economic losses. This provided a turning-point for the door of the movie is the president through diplomacy. North Korea has suspended provocation for more than 50 days, and China has completed its political variables by reorganizing its leadership of President Xi. Trump, the president took office again after her trip to Asia for the first time in the street. In other words, the countries are pursuing exit strategies simultaneously. Now is the time for a change in the situation. Trump who is president, and 3:00 p.m., to refrain from harsh words as much as possible in the Beijing period. At the summit, the two countries reaffirmed and confirmed their commitment to normalize relations. The door quickly restored relations could lead to a December visit of the president and the two countries have the signs.

Trump the president's visit, a shortness of breath begin diplomacy. If the U.S. reaffirmed its solid alliance at the third Korea-U.S. summit in Seoul on July 7, the two countries ' summit talks on the APEC agenda would collapse due to the "" THAAD : Trust in America "" issue. The biggest challenge in the past six months since the new administration was also diplomacy. North Korea was the biggest variable. Four days after the government's inauguration, the company launched a new medium and long range ballistic missile (IRMB) test and launched a "" severe advanced diet "" that was designed to test the planet Mars 12. It was literally a ' singo ' diet. Since then, North Korea has conducted an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM-level) and even conducted its sixth nuclear test in September. They hit the provocation every week.The Berlin Initiative, ambitious to announce at the beginning of its term by the new government, was simply a concept. He was ignored by North Korea for every suggestion he made, such as the military talks, reunions of separated families, and attending the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. The theory of the Korean Peninsula drivers grew into a rumor that North Korea is also going to ignore South Korea. America was also a tough nut to crack. U.S. The president is Donald Trump ‘Strong Man’ traits that would give full play. It has raised tension on the Korean Peninsula as much as North Korea, issuing statements such as "" Fire and fury, "" "" Destroy the North completely, "" and "" The suicide rocket man. "" The relationship between Korea and China was worse. After the deployment of the THAAD missiles, the storm immediately led to massive economic losses. This provided a turning-point for the door of the movie is the president through diplomacy. North Korea has suspended provocation for more than 50 days, and China has completed its political variables by reorganizing its leadership of President Xi. Trump, the president took office again after her trip to Asia for the first time in the street. In other words, the countries are pursuing exit strategies simultaneously. Now is the time for a change in the situation. Trump who is president, and 3:00 p.m., to refrain from harsh words as much as possible in the Beijing period. At the summit, the two countries reaffirmed and confirmed their commitment to normalize relations. The door quickly restored relations could lead to a December visit of the president and the two countries have the signs. Improving relations with China could lead to a new solution to North Korea's policy toward the North. dlcw@heraldcorp.com"
"[Hankyoreh] [Toyopanel]Why? In May, the shadow of the tone show ' The Streaming Age ', popular singer G-Dragon released an album made with USB / mobile storage device without making a sound. Some say that the choice of the leading hallyu star was due to the structure of the Korean music market in which the creators were unable to make a profit. Around the same time, Shin Dae-cheol (50), a member of the rock group Cinat, told the correct Sound Source Cooperative Federation that "" proposal for revising the rules to collect and distribute sound sources. "" We went into the domestic music scene, which even worried G-Dragon, who is categorized as the top 1 % profit group, and rock star, the most popular artist during the boom.Singer G-Dragon's solo album < Kwon Ji-yong > A jacket photo. He released an album made with USB last May. Lee Hyo-ri, the singer of last July on the Korean television show Happy Togeder, said, We didn`t advertise or hold an event, but there was no way to make any money from the music. It is hard to make a living (only with music), "" drew attention. Lee also mentioned singer Psy's ' Gangnam Style. ' Even the globally popular hit "" Gangnam Style, "" has earned close to 30 million won in profit from the songs here. It is necessary to change the profit structure of the music industry : "" According to the Income Structure Change of the Culture, Sports and Tourism Broadcasting Commission 2012, the ' Digital Music Market Research & Improvement Plan ' of the Gangnam branch was filed with the Culture, Sports and Tourism Broadcasting Commission in Seoul in 2012 with the Ministry's ' Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. ' Psy took half of the profits. He wrote the song jointly with composer Yoo Geon-hyeong. At that time, ‘ Gangnam Style ’ captured the top 9 ranking in the ‘ Gaon Chart ’, the online sales data for music services provided by the nation's six major music service providers (Melon, Ginney, Emnett, Bugs, Soribada, and Olleh Music). The number of downloads reached 28.6 million and 27.32 million. Unlike the huge paychecks that Psy would receive when he starred in an ad, his earnings from his hit song ' Gangnam Style ' were humble. There are also situations in which the Korean sound industry has a lower royalty rate than other countries, but there is a separate reason for this. In the early 2000s, when the music market crashed into the "" owned "" era, record wholesale merchants closed their doors one after another. Since then, the online illegal download market has grown rapidly based on P2P sharing services such as Soribada. At that time, the music service provider significantly reduced the price of its music rights (unlimited streaming products) as an alternative to bringing music consumers into the paid and legal market. Naturally, consumers have also seen a decline in ' legal download. ' Consumption patterns have passed into the era of "" streaming "", in which a sound source provider accesses an online platform to pay monthly fee and listen to sound sources freely. The shift from the era of ownership to the age of streaming combined with the profit sharing structure of the local sound market has resulted in higher sacrifices for sound creators and producers. Streaming products have a limitation where they can not but be held to a basic low-price policy to keep consumers from illegally downloading and encouraging legitimate use, said Park Byung-woon, head of the selection committee at the Korea Music Awards. As the music giant exploits, the small price goes out of the question for the copyright holders and the performers. It has become a reality that most musicians can not live on with music. In May, singer G-Dragon released an album made with USB (mobile storage device) without making a sound. The music industry was at odds over whether it was a recording or a sound. The Korean Music Content Industry Association has set it as the sound source, while the Korean Copyright Association has recognized it as an album, with mixed reviews from the industry. Why did G-Dragon, who is categorized as Hallyu star and the nation's top star, go on this adventure? Seo Jeong-kyo, a music commentator, said, We find it hard to expect even the top star to make big profits in the local music market. It is a challenge that G-Dragon will reject the one-way sound supply structure centering on the traditional music service provider and go with the aim of becoming a consumer and creative license, he said. Currently, about 7 won in revenue is generated when a song is played on most Korean sound service sites. About 49 percent of this is due to service operators and distributors (brokers of producing companies ' songs) who build sites and "" display "" sound sources. Producers take 35 percent. The creators, who wrote, composed, and arranged the song, had to share about 10 percent of it with each other. Only 6 percent of singers and performers who "" break off "" their music are. When consumers listen to music through a streaming service, the songwriter, composer and alterer receive 0.7 won per song (or 0.7 won per piece, if the songwriter differs), and the singer or performer gets 0.42 won. Even when played through a ' discount service offering, ' revenue drops nearly half. As a result, most indie bands earn less than about one million won per year. Koo Young-hwan (alias · 23) is the vocals of a rock band. It is also difficult for her to make a living by just making sound. All his earnings from the program are "" 10,000-20,000 won "" that is deposited into his account every two to three months. He is holding out for music lessons or working in restaurants. Shin Dae-chul (50), a member of the rock group Sinawi and the chairman of the Right-Sound Sounds Cooperative Federation, is also strongly criticizing the current sound market structure. "" I'm glad that the song is so called a ' hit ', but I don't think it's possible for every creator to be at the top of the music charts. The "" rich and poor "" phenomenon of the music industry is serious. This is bound to get worse if the price of sound is normalized and the distribution structure is not improved. "" It has been pointed out consistently that the distribution structure of the music industry must improve. In 2015, the share of creators who downloaded songs was adjusted from 60 percent to 70 percent, but the actual gains were small as usage was limited to download products that saw their consumption decline significantly. Streaming service currently account for about 80 percent of Korea`s music industry, overwhelming downloading services. The only sound collection and distribution regulation in the world that exists only in Korea violates the right of creators to decide what to make or what to do, the KAPP points out. Although music is a human art, service operators who distribute or sell music based on market and capital preference have become powerful and the rights and interests of creators have been violated.Singer Psy's hit song "" Gangnam Style "" domestic charts was valued at just 36 million won per share, forcing distributors to take more profits from the top 30 million won. If the distributors fall behind, bad men, artists or melons, and producers will be forced to display the top 100 songs on display. It is like a mart with its function of displaying and selling products does not take more than half of its income. As small producers and creators who maintained cultural diversity and hit niche markets in the standardized music market failed to make fair profits, it is hard to create any more creative activity, Shin said. It is a clear unfair case that the songs are sold at up to 75 percent off the market as soon as they are released. He stressed that the rules on the reduction of Korean sound collection should be repealed, allowing the owners to return part of their price decisions to their owners as they do abroad. * Click on the image to expand it. Some point out that even if the proportion of copyright holders increases to a certain extent in the sound's profit structure, it is hard to solve the "" rich and poor "" phenomenon in the music industry. The normalization of sound emission regulations is not the main alternative to eventually creating a healthy virtuous circle in the music industry. In addition, the problem that copyright holders with one percent of high income certificates and 99 percent of low income certificates suffer is that they have other real problems. "" Even if the rules on the distribution of proceeds from the sound changes in favor of the creators, the change to the skin for low-income copyright holders should not have been made, "" said Hong Jae-mok, 32, a musician at the Display Service Company. If they fail to make it into the ranking, their accessibility with consumers will fall dramatically and they can not expect profits. Now, most popular songs, including Melon, are shown on major music sites with a focus on ranking. Naturally, the access to consumers of different genres of non-mainstream music has been reduced. Kim Min-jae, head of the music industry's music industry, who manages large musicians, also wrote, "" Several of the top 100 songs by the nation's largest consumers were not available to receive ' Melon, ' saying they were not used by several hundred thousand won. "" Even if the rules on sharing profits with the sound industry change in favor of the creators, they will only receive 10,000 to 20,000 won more in their existing profits, he predicted. The current sound source market depends on profits from the top 100 charts operated by melons or other. According to Kim, if one stays within the top 100 in Melon, one can expect profits as he did in the album boom of the 1990s. On the other hand, it is difficult to collect production costs if they do not make it to the top 100. If you don't hire a famous singer without a music video, the cost of producing one sound is usually less than five million won. Just as the items on the shelves in the mart are selling well, Melon and other sites display their songs with popular music that has become one of the top 100. That is why producers are concerned about strategies to be ranked in the top 100 on popular music sites. There is an easy way to reach the top 100 Melon. A company official said, "" Songs can be uploaded into the three new accounts at the top of the melon site. "" "" If you go into this account, you can actually get the top 100."
"100 percent guaranteed, he says. "" Because most consumers click on the three seats, "" says the quiet war between retailers and producers to get the golden account. How do I get this account? `` The most effective method is to leave it to Loen Entertainment, the main distributor of Melon, to distribute, '' he said. Of course, Loen won`t be able to put all the songs in circulation on our Golden Account. It should be from an agency that has some influence, it added. Through distributors, an additional 9 % of their profits will have to be deducted. Most music consumers play mostly the top 100 songs. Therefore, famous creators who have recently tested various genres, as well as idol groups, seem to make their own songs based on popular codes rather than their personal songs. This is to stay within the top 100 for as long as possible. The vocals on the indie band "" Chung-sik Band "" (32) spoke out about the sad reality of musicians. For musicians who have not yet given up on creating experimental music, it is hard to expect sound source earnings on platforms like now. So, they think of sound sources as just promotional "" business cards. "" We can not but gradually resign ourselves to a scheme of sound display that excludes diversity. "" Any alternatives? "" If you're a creator, you don't use an alternative sound source service, like Bainil, to ensure a stable return on your creative, "" he said. Vinyl is a sound site that was launched last July and provides a price preference to its creator, unlike other existing sound source sites. The site's distribution share of the creators's songs is up to 74 percent. Of course, it is not easy to sell or distribute the album without a strong fan base like G-Dragon. Every year, new musicians appear at the Korean Music Awards or at the closing ceremonies by media. Rep. Park Byung-woon said, "" The musical achievement shown by the new musicians was absolutely amazing in view of the existing bad music climate. "" "" It is a pity that they are all about to be forced to live in poverty. "" Using services from a mega-sounding site that is currently limited is not the only way to support musicians, he said. I hope you will be interested in their performances.

Moon Jae-in, president and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping in Da Nang, Vietnam last November summit in exchanges and cooperation in the field of track to recover as soon as possible.I did The president visited China next month her Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping and decided to hold a summit talk again. Also, it is expected to meet Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang at the ASEAN Plus Three summit in Manila, the Philippines, from July 13 to 14. The plan is expected to discuss ways to normalize the exchange between the two countries, which was stopped by the THAAD conflict. As the THAAD agreement confirmed last month that the restoration of bilateral ties, the industry expects changes in China`s deregulation, the number of tourists to be restored, and the sale of Korean products in China could occur anytime soon. In addition, they are speeding up preparations for the reception of Chinese group tourists. Travel agencies are reviving with some of their employees returning to work after taking time off. A Chinese subsidiary is known to have recently offered an incentive tour package worth 3,000 to local governments, signaling its return to Yukah.(Seoul = Yonhap news) Ryoo Hyo-rim : South Korea and China have begun to bridge the dispute over the deployment of the THAAD (high-altitude missile defense system) of U.S. troops in Korea and normalize relations with the Chinese tourism industry. The photo shows Myeong-dong street, Jung-gu, Seoul. Duty Free Shop and department stores prepare to greet visitors with their eyes attentive to the return of Chinese tourists. If actual deregulation such as allowing group tourists to be recruited and resuming flight services is implemented, Chinese tourists can increase sharply. The distribution industry is actively expanding marketing to Chinese customers starting with the "" Chinese Black Friday "" (November 11). At the same time, preparations are underway to prepare for the influx of the Yukar into the country, such as restarting local networks. In addition, the Korea Federation of Travel Agents and Financial Companies are actively pursuing such partnerships. A breakthrough is also expected in China's crippled operations. The Chengdu Commercial Park project of Lotte Asset Development Corporation was suspended for more than six months, but local authorities approved it on July 31 when Korea and China announced the restoration of relations. The construction of Shenyang Lotte Town, which has been suspended for a year, is also expected to resume its construction in the near future. Korean Ambassador to Japan Roh Young-min sent a letter to Liaoning Province in his own name on July 6, asking for support to help revive the construction of Shenyang Lotte Town. Food and cosmetics industries, which have been hit hard by the THAAD controversy, also resumed Chinese marketing in earnest, including launching new products and localization strategies. These industries had difficulties in local businesses due to the Chinese boycott of Korean products, but their performance has recently shown a rebound. Industry watchers say Korea is expected to ease its crush in China due to the elimination of the Sead conflict, prompting more sales of Korean products, especially due to the formulation of the summit talks between the two countries, that would help us get back to normal travel.(Seoul = Yonhap news) Kim Hyun-tae : As Korea and China have increased their conflict over the deployment of the THAAD (High-level missile defense system) system of U.S. soldiers in Korea and began to normalize relations, Korean tourists to Korea (formerly known as a tourist group) Chinese yuan is exchanged on Myeong-dong street, Jung-gu, Seoul on July 3. 2017.11.3 double@yna.co.kr report an article and of the door, ▶ (Click!) the latest fashion trend area, all (Click!)

"Industry rival Yeon-no-ja, here are two companies that are not similar to each other by a different standard with the ` First ` argument with the ` Japan-point Contest and Malicious Comment `. One firm hit the market top by selling off more than one well of its accommodation business for more than 10 short years, while another firm saw its growth potential through its web-harded business. Fierce competition between those who are chasing and chasing is leading to criminal cases. It is a difficult story between Noulja, the company's innovation company, and the company that divides the accommodation app market. According to the related industries on July 12, a woman was prosecuted for attempting to approach her rival Nonoza's lodging database via API for five months since June 2016. There are three main charges that apply to the ` what's going on here ` : the ` Piranoulja ` homepage, the ` DDD attack `, and the interference of the ` Extra-Computery `. As we acknowledged the crawling attempt last year and requested the police to investigate it, the rival was found to be involved, we decided to disclose the case even in terms of establishing the correct ecosystem in the industry, said an official at Yanoza. There have been many disputes between the two companies before. The key to the accommodation app market is to attract affiliate motels They visit motels across the country and persuade their owners. The structure involves frequent collisions among field sales personnel. Early last year, when she visited the QR code installed in the affiliate motels room, the salesperson damaged her. Early last year, when Nola found out that malicious comments were frequently posted in her articles, she asked for police investigation and, through a cognitive investigation, she found out that the source of malicious comments was busy. In July of the same year, he also requested the police to investigate when he found a stock market information sheet containing malicious content being distributed here and in the process of attracting secondary investment. What do you think? I have one thing in common : I suspect the other party as being behind the scenes with no clear evidence, and the police investigation is underway. Industry watchers point to the "" excessive first degree anxiety "" as the background of the fight between the two companies. As the market was dominated by 50 different types of accommodation applications, ` What's the Trouble Tones ` here, which is growing rapidly after the launch of the service. Latecomer Ondana also had to go for a strong drive, including noise marketing, to close the gap. That's why it's not uncommon for people to emphasize the ' best in the industry ' in their favor. The accommodation app market has a somewhat unique environment among the O2 (Off Link) businesses. The accommodation app market is a market that is overflowing with cash flow and highly scalable in the business sector. However, dominant platform providers such as Naver and Kakao have not yet entered the market. Under these circumstances, the competition between the two companies to win the first rank in the industry is becoming a "" muddy battle. "" The windowman is overwhelmed here by the power of the business or the size of the sales, the number of apps downloaded, and the cumulative investment earned. Last year's sales of yanoza were 68.4 billion won, more than twice as much as any here (24.6 billion won). Since its inception in 2005, the company has attracted more than 91 billion won in investment, while the total investment here is 33 billion won. Here, Doga is ahead of Williaja with the partnership score and the monthly user count. How about here? The monthly traffic is about 2.2 million, twice as many as that of the ` Let's Play ` (1 Million). In the process, Younulja insists, "" If you are a company, you are ranking by sales. "" And here, any O.O.O business owner emphasizes, "" It is important to have an index that fits its environment. "" Both companies ' claims are, in fact, correct. The two companies are the same lodging app operator, but they have different profit structures. Yanoulja is actively engaged in offline business, such as the operation of a motel directly or the franchise business. In the process, large-scale investment was also attracted. Sales can not help but outplay here. Whereas here is one that has some offline business, it still focuses on the online lodging app business. In other words, it is rather difficult to assess the two companies on the same standard. According to the related businesses, Chairman Lee Soo-jin and CEO Shim Myung-seop met two to three times last year. It is not known what the two companies talked about, but the dispute between the two companies has become more heated since their last meeting. / New Seoul Economic Research Center ; All Series of Seoul's top scientists since 1997 with the Ministry of Government Administration and Home Affairs ; and Seoul Economic Research Union's exclusive distributor for the Seoul Metropolitan Government, 700 provinces, and Seoul Metropolitan Government Inspection facilities were 3,708 nationwide, including large discount stores, public sports facilities, town, land, and dong offices, and natural parks that were likely to be used by the physically handicapped.

As the ministry's research office previously released its report on the results of its investigation into alleged comments by the Armed Forces Cyber Command in August 2014, among which about 7,000 comments were posted, all of which were posted on the Internet by cyber warfare agents were confirmed as about 2,700,000 cases or by October 2013. Lee`s remarks were believed to have highlighted the charges and what was later recognized in the court trial. Political comments by the National Intelligence Service or the military Cyber Command could be questioned, but major intelligence agencies ' attempts to obstruct any form of criminal activity by ignoring the whole intent of conducting psychological warfare against North Korea were made to disrupt major intelligence agencies ' activities.

"Financial Times in Britain reported on July 11 that Indians envy Beijing citizens who are breathing relatively cleaner air.As smog covered New Delhi, the capital of India, to the full extent that it resembles gas chambers, people in New Delhi are complaining of failing to prevent it in advance.New Yorkers are looking enviously at Beijing's people, who are seeing improvements in the air these days. In recent years, Beijing's fine dust has declined slightly due to government efforts. New Delhi citizens even believe China`s one-party Communist Party poison is more effective in fighting smog, the FT said. India's democratic practice makes effective anti-Mug policies difficult to achieve, but China added that it believes its communist party is in a more dictatorial position, and therefore stronger measures can be taken in the war against smog. The fine dust in New Delhi scored 833 late Wednesday. On the same day, Beijing was 76. More than 50 is not healthy, and more than 300 is fatal. It is true that Beijing's air pollution has improved slightly with efforts to relocate its carbon-emission plant to neighboring Hubei Province from 2013 to 2016. This is in stark contrast to New Delhi, where the same period of air pollution is worse. Furthermore, sulfur dioxide is also rising in New Delhi. China's sulfur dioxide has decreased by 75 percent since 2007, according to a report by the journal Science. India, by contrast, increased by 50 percent. This is frustrating New Delhi citizens. New Delhi citizens even blame India's political system. This week, Prime Minister Aravind Kariwal of New Delhi compared the city to a ' gas chamber. ' Kariwal attacked Prime Minister Marin the Singh on his Twitter, saying, "" Burning straw in neighboring Punjab province is the main culprit of the Delhi smog. "" `` The Prime Minister of New Delhi blames someone else, '' Singh responded.As such, India is the district heating system for solving problems. But China, which adopts a communist dictatorship, maintains a single file in its fight against pollution. China has made slight improvements in Beijing's air by shutting down its air pollution dump site or relocating to neighboring Hubei Province. Environmental activists criticize the Chinese government's policy, saying that the air in neighboring Hubei Province has become worse instead of cleaner in Beijing. However, Indians are envious even of this. Because the Indian government is almost a stage book in smog. "" It is true that one-party toxins like the Chinese Communist Party are more effective in fighting smog, "" said TK ChoushI, director of the Center for Occupational and Environmental Studies in New Delhi. `` This is especially true in a democracy where 50 percent of the population is poorly educated, '' he added.Sinopark @ Chinese fishing boats to bring them out in. the East Sea squid catch was greatly reduced.Kwak Sang-eun covered the story.Fishing for squids in the fishing boats whose lights are brightly lit.

""" It's a policy that encourages overdue loans. "" "" Only the interest paid by the rich are at stake. "" These comments are not reflected in the government's upcoming articles on debt relief or support measures for the poor. It is often said that the idea of helping the needy is too much to forgive a debt that has to be paid or that the delinquent payment is not charged at all. Anyone who has paid off the debt regularly has a relative sense of deprivation, and most importantly, the principle of "" debt payment "" is contradictory. Disapprobation with the new government's policies is not always grounded. But when you look at the other side of the policy, it's hard to say it is absolutely provocative. Most of all, the government is not designed to pay off long-term debt owed by taxpayers. The Government announces its debt write-off policy this month. Next month, we are going to present a plan to support the delinquent. Though it is beyond criticism for its policy objectives, it is also criticized as a populist policy, which reduces debt and interest payments that must be made. The target debt write-off package, which stipulates that the amount of tax payment has not been credited to the debt relief policy, is 40 people who have failed to repay debts worth 10 million won or less out of 2.8 million outstanding debt held by the National Happiness fund. If the statute of limitations is still in place and you don't pay your debts in more than 10 years, you're actually going to be in the poorest, and you're going to get out of debt in two. If so, the Happiness fund may question whether it suffers a substantial loss, or whether taxpayers ' money is spent on this process. The answer is no. National Fund funds created to Park Geun-hye, former president of the presidential election pledge of happiness. The candidate pledged to reduce debt owed by 3.22 million delinquent borrowers by setting up an 18-trillion-won national happiness fund to help the debt-laden poor. But in reality, the fund's business has shrunk to 1.5 trillion won. The government has not spent a penny on that. Lee Myung-bak, the former president of the jeosinyongja as state-initiated credit recovery fund was created by promising to the debt funds move on to national happiness. Simply put, I just replaced the nameplate. The credit recovery fund was also funded by the contributions of banks, so the government's finances were free of any charges. That is why many say the government has not spent a penny on the ' debt-loss debt write-off ' project but has only prided itself with money donated by banks. Happiness fund hardly loses collection agencies? return of 50 %. The Fund made debt adjustments by purchasing overdue bonds at a cheap price from banks, lenders and other financial institutions. For the debtor, the debt to the financial institution went to the happiness fund. When a debtor asked the Happiness fund to make a debt adjustment, they would give me about 50 percent off the original amount, and then I would split the rest in 10 years to repay it. The Fund will allocate future collection gains to encourage financial institutions to sell overdue bonds at a cheap price. It's not a losing proposition even for financial institutions. We can pass on overdue bills that are hard to collect to the fund, and we can expect more in the future. According to the National Happiness Fund, the amount of overdue loans that the Happy Fund collected from more than 2.5 million people who were delinquent was estimated at 1.3.197 trillion won from May 2013 to July of this year. The purchase of 16.45 trillion won worth of overdue bonds at 5.2 percent of its principal, resulted in an additional 409.4 billion won withdrawn from the purchase price. When you look at the return, it's 50 percent. So, it has been pointed out that the Happiness fund is more dependent on collecting bonds. In fact, only 582,000, or 20 percent, of the 2.8 million people who have been repackaged by the happiness fund have ever received debt. Eventually, the government said it would completely forgive the debt of a debtor whose principal amount is less than 10 million won, but the actual debt is much less than 10 million won, and the fund loses face value. And the government has decided not to make 400,000 people eligible for benefits, but to actually sort out the poorest based on strict evaluations. In the context of this, it is hard to think of as a reckless debt relief policy. Still, it is quite incontrovertible that all the previous Government's drastic policies of "" anticlimax "" have not been met before. In particular, the government's latest measure is intended to be a one-time measure, such as the special amnesty for the Aug. 15 Independence Day. In this case, the criteria for cancellation can be highly contentious for fairness. It is not convenient, but the default period is less than 10 years, which makes it unlikely that they will be exempt from payment. Lee Myung-bak, the former president and Park Geun-hye, former president a candidate, funky jeosinyong rescue pledge was unveiled. The former president is 3.2 million people's pledge, the origin and a large scale, before the president is 7.2 million credit defaulters of the rhetoric that he would reduce the debt burden. But it was all just a compliment. They all pushed forward with a strong will, but the moral hazard debate caused them to lose their promise. The success of the new government's policies depends in fact on how it copes with these controversies.

"KEB Hana and the additional interest rates were cut by up to 0. 0.4p ... [Yonhap news agency] [Yonhap news photo] [Kim EuI-rae, a reporter of Yonhap news agency,] said, "" The mortgage rate has soared by more than 4 %. The government's warning prompted banks to lower their additional rates. According to the bank on July 12, mortgage rates of the five major commercial banks (KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Woori, KEB, NHCF) combined (fixed and floating rates) were 0.423 percent lower than those of Jeonju. As of July 13, the KEB Hana Bank Mortgage Guide rate will be 3.719 to 4.719 percent per annum. A week ago, the bank recorded 3.922 to 5.142 percent annual, making it the only bank among the top five banks to have five percent. The rate of the loans fell to 4 percent again, including a five-year decline in the debt-setting rate of the bonds and a further cut in interest rates. The basic rate of interest was cut by 0.023 % from 2.622 % to 2.599 %, and the additional rate of interest was lowered by 0.18 to 0.40 %. As the government put a stop to the recent increase in lending rates, KEB Hana Bank lowered its additional rate. The government announced a package of household debt measures last month and said it would step up monitoring to ensure that the financial sector does not raise the rate excessively. Kim Yong-beom, vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission, and Park Se-choon, vice chairman of the Financial Supervisory Service, also warned that they would step up their loan rates by saying, "" If you raise the interest rates without good reason, you could face criticism. "" KB Kookmin Bank also lowered its mortgage rate on its home equity network from 1.59 percent to 1.49 percent last week. Other bank lending rates declined 0.01 % or remained unchanged. Shinhan Bank's mortgage guide rate dropped by 0.01 percentage point to 3.65 to 4.76 percent from a week earlier, while Woori Bank also fell by 0.01 percentage point to 3.60 to 4.60 percent. NHCF also went down by 0.01 percentage point to 3.73 to 4.87 percent. KB Kookmin Bank will apply 3.67 to 4.87 percent of its mortgage guide rates, the same as a week ago. Financial institutions did not expect the mortgage rate to fluctuate much for the time being. Banks can hardly raise additional rates and market rates remain stable. However, it is expected that raising the key interest rate will have an effect if the U.S. and Korea raise it as expected. Since the Bank of Korea is expected to raise the key interest rate and the United States is also forecast to raise the key interest rate within this year, mortgage rates will move according to the monetary policy, a financial regulator said. However, the Copyx rate, to be announced this week, is expected to rise slightly as interest rates have risen over the past month. This would raise the rates of copy-based lending products simultaneously.Five-year-fixed mortgage rates at laecorp@yna.co.kr It is A illegal webtoon site. A site captures and copies contents of all Webtoons in the country and writes them on its site. According to the traffic aggregation site similarweb, site A had a visitor volume of 4.28 million last September. That is three times more resin comics and is higher than the G-Market. The traffic ranking on the Internet is 15th, but it is actually close to 10th place, except for the same site pages such as Naver news and Naver sports.Estimates of the Webtoons are 145.6 billion won in damages for the webcomic industry ▲ Local Internet traffic ranking A illegal Webtoons are ranked 15th as of September, so the Webtoons are protected from webcom-network traffic (as of this year) by a scale of 1,456. As a result, the webtoon industry, which had predicted the market price of 1 trillion won in 2020, is on alert. The site A, which has driven the webcomic industry to the brink of ruin, is known to make profit from illegal ads. However, it has recently been discovered that not only advertisements are forming, but also the areas in which websites are created to handle crime, such as database management, public relations agencies, illegal gambling and prostitution. Even calculating traffic raised by site A simply, an estimated 8 billion won per year in profit is based on Google AdSense. Considering their links to illegal gambling, the profits they are earning will be astronomical. ▲ A illegal Webtoons enable monthly visitors to 46 million. That is five times more than Resin-coming Comics. In reality, the webtoon industry is in danger of collapsing the entire Webtoons ecosystem with the advent of A site. Naver Webtoons CEO Kim Joon-koo, who participated in a discussion forum on the past three days, said, "" If we fail to block illegal Webtoons, the current Webtoons are currently in a "" preview service "" collapse in the market. Jung Beom-sik, head of the overseas business team at Toomics, complained that the middle-sized Webtoons should be shut down in less than a year, not just two years, and that the industry needs to realize the seriousness of the situation. ' Advertisements on illegal Webtoons are mostly ' illegal gambling ', ' prostitution finding ' and ' illegal lending ', making it a bigger social issue as teenagers are exposed to these crimes without protection. According to a survey by the Korea Center for Gambling Problems, 1.1 percent of juveniles in schools and 9.2 percent outside schools are currently in question. In terms of the number of consultations, the number of counseling sessions has nearly tripled from 2015 to 2016. Lee Seul-haeng, director of the Center for Gambling Problems in Seoul, said, More and more illegal gambling for teens. The game's rules are so easy that it makes for extremely short and fast rotating games, such as odd and even 123 out of three snails. The problem is getting worse because it's so often and strong and has the ability to take small bets. "" And "" Teenagers are more likely to be addicted to gambling and games. "" As an alternative, it seeks to strengthen youth education to prevent gambling addiction, but can not dare to block gambling sites based abroad or illegal Webtoons to solicit with ads. ▲ Illegal gambling on teenagers = Illegal gambling on teenagers has increased dramatically every year. In 2017, the easiest way for teens to access illegal gambling is through illegal Webtoons. ⓒ SBS writers and government responsible illegal websites have been around for the past three decades, but this is the first time the A Webtoons has grown to an astronomical figure of 50 million visitors per month. Social problems such as youth gambling and prostitution are expected to worsen as a result.The Webtoons industry started to respond fastest. Since March, Resin Comics has requested Comeso to protect German copyrighted materials and has deleted all illegal websites exposed to Google and social media. However, it was not enough by the sheer power of businesses. Last year, approximately 1.8 million illegal contents were deleted by resin. However, this method could not stop the flooding of illegal sites. On the contrary, it has been growing by simply transferring the addresses of its sites since its response, said Resin Comics. Tumix, another webcomic platform, found an illegal webcomic response team and reported it to the police, but the police did not even consider it to be an object of investigation by treating the offenders as criminals. Naver Webtoons have also been hard to catch illegal distributors and give them to police, but were only fined two million won. It is a depressing reality, compared with the estimated loss of more than 100 billion won in the webtoon sector in 2017. Authors also share a sense of problem, opening a forum to share the dangers of illegal sites. It takes two months for the organization to pass a review to block illegal websites, an official at the webcomic Authors ` Association said. But it only takes 10 minutes to clone an illegal site, he said. "" Since this problem is not just a problem in the Webtoons industry, it is a mix that is causing various social problems such as juvenile delinquency (gambling, prostitution), various officials need to put their heads together and ask for alternatives. We need to have social attention for this. Real harm to webcomic artists is also getting worse. Webcomics writer B said, "" Since the advent of site A, the profit on paid coins has decreased by less than one-third. "" As a result, the possibility of a series of consent was leaked by mistake. Normally, three or four platforms or agencies have offered a series of articles at the same time, but now they are not offered a genre that is opaque in their next book, or a genre that is less likely to be leaked illegally by a webtoon author. Contract for works has also decreased, and the variety of works has decreased significantly, said Park Jeong-sik, who led the study.It is not a common sense now for private companies to fight criminals, said Park Seong-cheol, author of Webcommun Creations. `` The nation is obliged to support the free economic activities of all businesses and to protect the criminal acts that violate them. The people have entrusted it with their own rights. To protect the merchant fleet from pirates, it is like the merchants are hiring a private patrol boat, '' the ministry said in a call for a responsible response.Copyright : (c) Oh MyNews, no piracy and no redistribution ; cheer for this article!

We will wait and see what is going on, although our business partners are still in the process of presenting it to us, said one bread and butter maker. ◇ 3-party joint venture & salary increase of bakers by 13 percent…the joint venture offers improvement in treatment and holidays to employees, according to bread companies.Currently, Paris Bagette partners are holding a conference for bakery companies to explain the joint venture between the companies. While avoiding the official use of bread companies that are under heavy pressure, it is a way to reduce the damages of business partners. ""The registration was also completed on July 27, based on initial capital of 90 million won. It even has detailed plans for organizations and benefits programs.The briefing introduced a detailed plan for a joint venture by a three-way investment. If the bakery is converted to a win-win venture, the salary will be raised by an average of 13.1 percent, as it was previously known.Bonus payment plans are to be paid up to 200 percent per year by adjusting what used to be 50 percent of the basic salary paid per year on New Year's Day and Chuseok. Welfare points paid as benefits will be raised from the current 900,000 won to 1.2 million won, the same as those of affiliated companies.The improvement plan includes subscription to collective injury insurance, health examination and an opportunity to enter SPC Food Science University. "" Benefits are equivalent to those of the affiliated employees of the Paris Baguette, "" explained an insider.The holiday, which has been the biggest complaint of bakery companies until now, is also being promoted as a guarantee on October 8. As all 11 partner companies and organizations are consolidated, it is easy to recruit substitute employees for temporary work.In addition, the period of service and severance pay will be continued when they are transferred to the new company. However, it was confirmed that the length of service is not continued when the branch directly hires the employees.A baker is cleaning his bakery's machines in Paris Bagette, downtown Seoul. / News 1 p.Newspaper Yoonseong.2.6 Setting up a grievance handling commission…Commissioner says bread companies should work together to convince bakers to work together.The existing bread companies have drawn the line on the argument that they will receive work orders from all three parties, including the owners of the affiliated headquarters, the provisional management office, and suppliers.Internal organizations will comprise the operational and management support divisions and will establish special bodies such as the Labor Relations Council and the grievance settlement committee. The management team is responsible for recruitment and placement of bread companies, and quality control of the work areas. The management support team will be in charge of overall planning, education, quality improvement and support services.The committee will form a hot line of bread companies that have received unfair treatment from certain store owners and business partners. If problems arise, the issue will be resolved through a labor-management conference.A Paris Bagette partner said, We don`t have a consensus on how to deal with the issue, but we will try to get various opinions from the bakery companies through the presentation and gradually move on.The key is persuading the bread machine company. The Ministry of Employment and Labor said it would approve the purchase of bread companies on the premise of a three-way partnership. It is known that bakery companies are now considering hiring.One bread company that requested anonymity said, I hope the presentations will solve the problem of shared companies, saying, We have a lot of improvements to make, and hiring directly is one of the most probable problems that will lead to a day of mutual cooperation.Meanwhile, Paris Bagette Zerbant's union is demanding direct employment. The temporary use of jobs should be made according to the ministry's decision, the agency said, adding, Do not delay through lawsuits but hire the employees directly.Regarding this, a Paris Baguette official replied, "" I will try to solve the problem as smoothly as possible.

"· PSA : Opel, an import fund of GM A, decided to produce 100 % directly from 140,000 European factories in Korea. GM Offel succeeded in reducing GM's export volume by 33 %. In this case, GM Korea's production volume will be significantly decreased, leading to a drastic restructuring of its workforce.According to GM Korea on July 12, the PSA group announced Monday that it planned to revive Opel, which contains the same information. According to the plan, PSA will move the volume of imported factories from Korea to Europe by 2020 to increase the capacity of factories in Europe. However, the PSA did not disclose the specific volumes and previous years.GM Korea currently produces Carl at its Changwon plant and Mocha at its Bupyeong plant, and exports it to Europe via Opel. Last year, the export volume amounted to 140,000 units, or 33 percent of GM Korea`s total export volume of 420,000 units. If such quantity disappears, it is likely that Changwon and Bupyeong factories will have to restructure their production volumes and structures.GM Korea is still suffering from a shortage of operating hours on its production lines. Currently, the Bupyung plant is operating three factories, one that produces engines and tracks, and two that makes malligos and captiva. Although the plant was open during the week and night, it should reduce its working hours from two shifts per day to one shift. The Changwon factory is also in trouble. As the volume of exports has decreased, factories have been operating at around 70 percent of capacity.If the Bupyong plant and other factories in Korea switch to the first shift, we can not help but restructure the workforce by reducing staff, said a GM Korea. In fact, around 1000 temporary workers at the Gunsan plant, which produced cruise services after GM was withdrawn from Europe, left the factory. There are 800 temporary workers at the Bupyung factory, and when the export volume of Opel is gone, it is highly likely that such temporary workers will lose their jobs, as Gunsan plant. Changwon factory is known to have around 700 temporary workers out of 1,700 workers.There is a possibility that Changwon factories will completely lose their overtime work or work, another GM official said.The auto industry predicts that GM Korea will have difficulty surviving unless 140,000 cars are shipped to Opel. GM Korea has been in bad shape for the past three years, with total net losses exceeding 2 trillion won. Domestic sales fell 16.2 percent in the first half of this year from a year earlier. Exports have also decreased every year since GM withdrew its Chevrolet brand from Europe in late 2013. Exports amounted to 480,000 in 2014, 460,000 in 2015, and 420,000 last year, down from 630,000 in 2013.As there is no official position or policy on the part of GM headquarters, it is hard to jump to any conclusions about restructuring, adding that if Opel takes as many small or medium cars as possible, it would be possible to secure new cars in Korea.< jun@kyunghyang.com> ▶ [beads to shortcut] and actor Kim Jun, a senior reporter to beads sns, ▶ [Facebook] [See a cartoon] [ ©, Kyunghyang News, (www.khan.co.kr), unauthorized war damage and redistribution.Banned from Da Nang, Vietnam on November 11 -- ] apec the summit meeting summit - 文 president in December visit of the agreement … “Pyeongchang as to strive” - Xi Jinping Sade problem full stop.설왕설래하다 argue back and forth over whether the shooting is still stable - situation on the Korean peninsula, North Korean nuclear issue management … a peaceful resolution through dialogue - constant arrival, the ASEAN Summit, the Philippines on January 12.Digestion, Moon Jae-in, president and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in the afternoon of October 11 (local time) of Da Nang, Vietnam and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (apec) summit is held.Laughing and I'm glad to shake hands ahead of the summit at the Crowne Plaza Hotel.(Photo : Yonhap News Agency) [Da Nang (Vietnam) = edaily Kim Sung-gon news] Moon Jae-in president and Xi Jinping was a big smile.

"We should investigate only the interim reporting by the chief prosecutor to investigate the law enforcement authorities / the interim report / the head of the business unit. It is interpreted as a move to quell the controversy over the neglect of big businesses, which has not been resolved. Some concerns that no effective measures will be taken to reform the chaebol are considered, according to analysts. In particular, it is also noteworthy that the prosecution will file a lawsuit against the executives of the corporations or the registered directors and file a complaint against the person who conducts the illegal acts.The right to seek exclusive leave also took the first step toward an end. First, the Distribution 3 Act, such as the Member, Distribution and Distributor Act, was enacted to abolish the exclusive rights of high - rent. However, most of the interim reports released by the Fair Trade Act Enforcement Task Force on July 10 were revisions to the law, so it is expected that a test bill will pass the National Assembly. Fair Trade Commission Chairman Kim Sang-jo announces an interim report yesterday from the Fair Trade Commission (TF) at the government's Sejong Office. The Fair Trade Commission will strengthen the standard for reporting violations by prosecutors as early as the end of this year. In particular, it is planning to apply the standard of rigor to the cases of conglomerates.The biggest feature of the revision is that it also indicts the individuals who violate the law with corporations. Until now, the FTC has been criticized for reporting only the corporation and the natural person to a negative state even if they are suspected of serious violations of law. Although the commission has been criticized for not accusing it much so far, it is especially the cases that are problematic, not the cases involving the private sector but the private sector, Kim said, referring to the corporate penalty. In reality, large corporations consider it the most severe punishment to file a lawsuit against their owners ' families regardless of the amount of fines.The target of the charges will also be extended from executives to working-level officials. If the accusations by working-level officials are made like the ones in the United States, they can be considered dangerous to arrest and not violate the law, a commission official said. To that end, the FTC plans to draw up a basic table to question the significance of violations of the law.The procedure to abolish the exclusive right to request the completion of the contract ... The issue of the exclusive right to request to be abolished gradually after 36 years of birth in 1981, which was the most important matter of discussion on the TFP. TF first decided to scrap the three laws related to distribution among the six laws under the FTC. As the three laws provide relatively few punishment clauses and do not need complicated economic analysis, many say that the commission should not have to monopolize the right to launch. If the right to exclusive purchase is repealed under the Act on Distribution 3, individuals or civic groups can directly report distributors or franchises to the prosecution.However, it is controversial that one of the core laws on the abolition of exclusive rights for advertising, or the advertising law, is excluded from the field of abolition. To be frank, I don`t know whether it would fly like this. The results of the TF discussion were different, said the commission officials.The TF also suggested that the fines should be raised. The TF urged the Korea Fair Trade Act to double the maximum limit of the standard fine and the maximum limit of fixed fines.The government will also expand and promote punitive damages, which will require people to compensate more for alleged property damage than the cases of antisocial acts of collusion or retaliation. Although some laws on sub-contractor, franchise, and agency laws require companies to expand their laws on fair trade and distribution, and the amount of compensation should be increased up to 10 times.The FTC plans to submit a final report, including the six agendas, to the National Assembly in January next year for review of the bill. However, passage of the National Assembly is hard to say for sure. Most of the talk by the TF is very different between the ruling and opposition parties. In addition, some say that the commission violates the legislative power of the National Assembly.The TF interim report is highly meant as a reference when reviewing the bill at the National Assembly, Kim said, adding, The FTC has explained to its best and has many possible legislative achievements in the regular session.Sejong : Ahn Yong-seong, a reporter at ysahn@segye.com"
"The Ministry of Environment has again drawn its sword into German cars for the first time in more than a year since Volkswagen Diesel Gate. The ministry imposed fines totaling 70.3 billion won on BMW Korea, Benz Korea and Porsche Korea on July 8. BMW will face the largest ever surcharge of 60.8 billion won ($ 60.8 million) for a single company.The companies sold their vehicles without pre-certification, despite changes to emission gas and noise components. In addition, BMW has adjusted the emission test report for 81,1483 28 models certified by 2012 to 2015 in Korea. The test results were recorded differently from the models and test facilities tested in order to meet the certified conditions in Korea, or the test results were randomly reduced.The case of the document forgery and fabrication of the BMW Korea was similar to last year when Audi Volkswagen was disqualified for manipulating the document, the Ministry of Environment said. As a result, the direction of the development of the incident is likely to vary depending on whether it was an administrative error or whether it was a result of the fabrication of the exhaust gas. If it is suspicious, the problem is magnified by recalling it and rewarding the consumers, but if it is an administrative mistake, the fine will end at the point of paying a fine.The German car industry has announced three cases of forgery and alteration.As the Environment Ministry announced, "" Very relevant "" vs BMW "" administrative error, "" BMW Korea has recorded 10 car models certified by local authorities and 18 other gasoline powered cars to meet the actual conditions of their testing facility. However, BMW Korea said, "" The document we submitted in accordance with the import procedures shows that the cost of the goods was not found, and that it has nothing to do with running the car itself and safety. ""The environmental ministry claims that the tests were an administrative problem caused by tests conducted at multiple laboratories in Germany to export their cars manufactured in Germany. The same test applies for all of the German multiple laboratories, which was submitted to the Environment Ministry by a document that was tested outside of the dual environment ministry's accredited lab.When it was pointed out that the BMW started the R&D Center Certification Team in 2015, a small number of people claimed to have tampered with the above or others as ways to mark the measured value of the vehicle other than the one concerned.BMW faked the certification document it received from Germany on its chajong '0 D vehicle in 2011 and submitted it when it was certified here in 2012, according to the Environment Ministry. After receiving the certification for the product in Korea, he passed the certification by submitting the document of S5. A BMW official said, We have made a mistake in handling certification services for a car with less than 1000 A4 pages to get emission certification."" For example, there is an A1 vehicle and an A2 car, which sold here and was certified as A1 documents, "" an official at the Environment Ministry said.As it is difficult to understand the certification of parts changes and details, the Ministry of Environment will be able to receive the certification of parts and components without approval of KRW 1.7 billion, and the models of BMW 5 billion and Mercedes-Benz will be charged with the approval of the change. The Seoul Customs Service also indicted 14 people, including the head of the export and gas certification authorities and representatives of the companies who sell the products, on corruption charges under the customs law, and forgery and handling documents.We understand that when imported cars use different parts from the existing ones, they can be notified to Korean subsidiaries from headquarters, or were deliberately omitted by importers, said an official at the ministry.Parts related to the DB exhaust gas of Chosun Ilbo may have different performance depending on their size, location, and catalytic components, and excessive emission of other components may cause excessive emission. Therefore, it is necessary to check and authenticate changes.The company insists it did not intentionally miss certification of component change. If the parts are changed, the head office will notify us of the change, but the details of the change of the part numbers, such as small rubber pipes, are not known. In addition, some parts and specifications may be upgraded when the vehicle model year is changed, so it is not easy for importers to identify first.We can easily check visible specifications, but it is hard to keep track of thousands of parts when it comes to internal parts, said an official of the import car industry. In the case of the Ministry of Environment, Porsche Panamera 4 and Kaien S only changed part numbers of PCV valves, while Mercedes E100 and the E163 AMG changed the coolant on sensor.It is not recall problem ' dominant ...The Environment Ministry has recently announced that it will designate as many as 100,000 vehicles for emission test reports, overexhalation, and missing component certification. If all vehicles detected are determined to be recalled, the number would be equivalent to the recall of Audi's Volkswagen AG, which took place in 2015 and 2016.The forgery and non-authorization of certification documents are not directly related to car defects, but the Environment Ministry checks whether the parts are defective through annual inspections of the cars already sold and operated. Any defect in the process will result in a recall.If parts are fitted with not certified, they can affect emissions, etc., said an official at the Environment Ministry.However, the companies claim that they accidentally failed to certify the upgraded product or the defective document, and that it was not a case of being recalled. He also stressed, "" The car meets all technical standards and emission related regulations of Korea, Europe or the United States, so the existing car owners can operate with confidence. ""Experts also do not think it will go into recall. Automatic-department Kim Pil-soo at Daerim University said, It is not possible to recall the car unless it is intended to conceal the problem of defects, only expanding the authority-related investigation into German cars.[Kim Cham-jae, reporter] pumpkins@chosunbiz.com]chosunbiz.com"
"WSJ, "" Stephen J. Wipperstein, US Enterprise Sexual Harassment Prevention and Winesting "" A collection of photos of big shots in gender equality, New York City's New York Times fashion director, James E. McHerzy, and Hollywood wine studio, left (AP PhotosFile) (copyright holder (c) Yonhap news, no put-reading - redistribution) Local business reported on the 10th as having experienced rapid changes in workplace culture (WSJ) in the aftermath of the sex scandal by Hollywood tycoon Harvey Weinstein. According to a joint telephone poll conducted by WSJ and NBC News, 67 percent of U.S. employers reported that most companies experienced sexual harassment at work. This is higher than the 63 percent rate from the same survey in 1991. 48 percent of the women said they experienced sexual harassment or unwanted contact at work, and 41 percent of the men said they saw it. When asked what influence the recent high-profile sexual harassment story had on their opinions, eight out of 10 women answered, "" If I am treated unfairly as a gender issue in the future, I think I will be more likely to voice. "" Five out of ten people answered that it gave them a chance to think about their actions and how they interact with women. It shows that a string of high-profile figures, including Weinstein's sex scandals, and high-ranking officials ' scandals have affected the perception and behavior of working people. Companies are also beginning to aggressively prevent sexual harassment. The advertising giant Interpublick Group announced that 20,000 U.S. employees should receive training to prevent sexual harassment by the end of the year. `` Women are important in our business and in the workplace. We need to create a safe environment for everyone. WSJ said, "" Even companies that have not had any sexual harassment issues, such as Dell, Rockwell Automation, and Facebook, have begun preventive training and have looked closely at how employees interact, and this is a watershed incident that has changed in the workplace. "" When something goes wrong, people don`t look away. We should make this a watershed event. Earlier, it was Anita Hill of the early 1990s that served as a watershed for American gender equality. At a hearing by Clarence Thomas, the black candidate for the second Supreme Court justice in the United States, Anita Hill, also accused him of past sexual harassment. Clarence Thomas denies the charges and claims he was attacked because he is black, and passes the hearing 52 to 48. The WSJ analyzed that the number of female lawmakers who won the 1992 election was limited due to the opposition of voters. In fact, according to the Lynn Foundation and McKinsey ' "" 2017 Women at work "" report, 37 percent of working women in the United States lost their promotion or other opportunities because of their gender. Only 8 percent of the men were male. Women were less likely to receive feedback face-to-face with their bosses than men, the report said. However, the situation turned out very rapidly, which is different from the Anita Hill incident, the WSJ analyzed. Famous actresses encouraged by joining their revelations, and other women shared their stories with the # MeToo (Mitu) hashtag, creating a deluge of stories. Actor Angelina Jolie (left) and Agnes Paltrow, who was involved in Harvey Weinstein's sex scandal, said, "" As I wrote to Tom, I don't think our former CEO would be impressed with our culture. The change of generations also seems to have affected. Maggie Wildertor, former Frontier Communications chairman, said, In the past, women had to struggle alone, but with an increase in the number of working women and greater authority, they can make sexual harassment public. The Alibaba Group announced on July 12 that it sold 168.2 billion yuan (28 trillion won) in products for 24 hours from midnight on the day of the Liberation Day. The figure is a 39.3 percent increase from last year's 120.7 billion yuan, which is even higher than the original 150 billion yuan estimate. Compared to the first year of the mining system in 2009, it is 3,000 times larger. Concerns over slowing growth in the Chinese economy have once again confirmed the strong purchasing power and online shopping growth of Chinese consumers. The Alibaba T Mall saw its main event start at midnight on the same day, with its main event total amount exceeding 100 million yuan (approximately 168 million won), and the main event total amount exceeding 100 million yuan (10 million won) in 28 seconds. The explosive increase in the sales of mining products is attributed to mobile payment, which was simplified to increase the supply of smartphones. Nine out of 10 orders from this year's event were placed via mobile. The percentage of mobile transactions rose to 42.6 percent in 2014, 68.7 percent in 2015 and 82.0 percent in 2016, up from 148 percent in 2013, but exceeded 90 percent this time. According to Chinese government figures, China has 511.16 million Internet users as of the end of June, and 96.3 percent, or 724 million people, are mobile Internet users connected by smartphones. Alibaba's mobile payment application (app) "" Alipay "" was paid 1.4 billion won on October 11, making it an average payment by all Chinese.As Ali Baba announced the globalization of Gwang-gun, more than 60,000 foreign brands participated in the event and about 100 Chinese brands went on to sell globally. As many as 200 countries participated in the optical service through "" Haebeok Strap, "" or "" Kunminjeong, "" a fast ball game player. Korean retailers and cosmetics companies have also enjoyed special experience in mining, as they have recently been engaged in a thaw of the THAAD conflict. It is thanks to the success of the promotion of the mining industry by Korean businesses at Chinese shopping malls. E-Land China, the Chinese arm of E-Land Group, announced on July 12 that it recorded 466 million yuan (767 billion won) in sales at Alibaba T Mall during the day. It is a 39 percent jump from last year. E-Land operated 19 Brand pipes, including E-Land, Prich, Scofield and Poinpo, at the T Mall. Global H Mall, a website specializing in reverse shopping, also reported on July 1-10 that sales increased 96 percent from the same period last year.Shinsegae Department Store announced that its sales rose 37.7 percent in China over the two days from October 10-11, and Lotte Duty Free Store announced a 11 percent rise in Chinese sales from May 5-11 due to 15 percent increase in online sales and offline sales. In Shilla Internet Duty Free, sales increased by about 30 percent from last year to November. Galleria Duty Free Store 63 aired its first live broadcast between the duty-free store logistics center and China on July 11 for the first time since the THAAD conflict between state-run broadcaster CCTV and China. The news covered the busy field news of the logistics center due to the "" Kwang-gun Zero, "" and covered the promotion of the store's optical group system. Sales at Galleria Chinese-language online duty-free shops also increased by 10 percent from the previous year. LG Household & Health Care Service also announced on July 11 at T Mall, a year-on-year increase of 68 percent and a 104 percent rise in cosmetics sales. Sales of cosmetics brand Hu, popular among Chinese, rose 54 percent from last year. In Taobao, ' Who's Who ' topped luxury skin care. Sulhwasu Yoonjo Esseum, the leading brand of Amore Pacific, sold 10,000 bottles every second on the day of the festival, becoming the first luxury line skin set to be sold. The discount event started in November of 2009 when Alibaba decided November 11 to coincide with the number one hit, marking its biggest sales day in the world, and starting the event as a result of a shopping spree that began as a result. It is already 2.5 times more than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined based on last year's amount of business."
