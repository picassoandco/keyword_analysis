Prosecutors requested 25 years in jail, a penalty of 185 billion won, and a surcharge of 77.19735 billion won to Choi Soon-sil. Lee Bo-bae, a reporter at Yonhap News Agency, told prosecutors that Choi Soon-sil, a secret heavyweight who started a crackdown on state affairs, was in jail 25 years ago. Choi was also shocked by the prosecution`s old-fashioned opinions and asked for a break from the trial. Choi was excited, but moved to take a rest in a wheelchair. Lee Kyung-jae, lawyer for Choi, said in a trial on July 14 at a criminal settlement hearing held at the Seoul Central District Court, "" It was a miracle for the accused to bear the case in good faith.

The lawyer denied any other charges that were applied to Choi. Choi asked the court to suspend the court's ruling while Lee was in the middle of his final argument. Choi, who was leaving the court, was restrained by the guards from saying anything with a glaring eye on the prosecution. Then when Choi screamed "" Aaaagh!

"The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced yesterday that it would send a message to multiple home owners to facilitate rental housing registrations. Can be summarized in one line "" Do you want to rent the house for 8 years or sell it now? "" There were three things that were expected to be included in the measures to boost rental housing registrations. ① Measures to revive rental housing ② Measures to protect tenants ③ Measures to put a cap on the monthly rent and to apply for renewal of a contract The cap on monthly rates and the introduction of a claim for renewal of contracts were delayed. There was nothing much new about the measures to protect tenants. The main idea was to protect tenants by increasing the number of regulated rental houses.To that end, the government said it would actively encourage multiple home owners to register their rental apartments. Multiple home owners will be given tax and health insurance premiums to become "" government-registered rental businesses. "" The key requirement was to "" lend long, "" and the proposed timeframe is eight years. If rental for more than eight years is allowed, the transfer income tax is not reflected in the current nor the comprehensive real estate tax is added up. The long-term special deduction rate will rise from 50 percent to 70 percent. The 40 to 80 % reduction in health insurance premiums for businesses subject to separately taxed less than 20 million won per year was carried out according to the rental period.◇ Do you want to rent for 8 years?The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport has changed the criteria to exclude the comprehensive real estate tax and comprehensive real estate tax from the current five-year or more rental period to encourage the registration of long-term rental housing. The special deduction rate for long-term holding of transfer taxes was 50 percent to 20 percent, compared to that of rental apartments with 85 ㎡ or less. Taxes and health insurance premiums on rental income less than 20 million won per year, which has been set to begin in 2019, will also be reduced. Property taxes will be cut for eight-year-loan rentals, an 80 percent increase in premiums, and a 40 percent reduction for four-year rentals. Local taxes are exempt from acquisition and property taxes until 2021. The income tax on rental housing was also increased by giving a reduction on rental housing. The government will consider setting a cap on the monthly transfer tax and enforcing the claim for contract renewal if the registration of rental service is sluggish until 2020, and gradually enforcing the right of tenants to register on the lease. Renters are expected to be able to stay stable for up to eight years without worries about steep rental increases and moving. Private transportation market, which used to be a blind spot, needs to ensure residential stability for tenants, said Kim Hyun-mi, Land, Transport Minister.The government's goal is to increase the current size of 800,000 households, or the number of registered private rental apartments, to 2 million by 2022. State-registered rental housing has a limited rate of rent increase. In fact, it would reduce various tax rates and burden on the owners of rental apartments while gaining a cap on the rates of pre-monthly hikes. Experts doubt the effectiveness of the measures. In contrast to the increased limit of 10 million won in tax breaks, the tax benefits were not significant, if the rent was not raised significantly during the next eight years and the period was not observed. Although it can be an exit for multiple home owners, we need to supplement it after implementation to attract tenant registration, said Goh Joon-seok, director of Shinhan Financial Consultation`s real estate advisory center. In order to increase the number of rental registrations, the currently announced reform measures, such as tax reduction benefits and insurance premiums incentives, need to be expanded further. Since the benefits of registering rental contractors have been concentrated on long-term rental businesses for more than eight years, there is a possibility that short-term rental businesses will be excluded from the registration process.The government has restricted the rent increase rate to five percent during the period of the lease obligation, but it is said to be meaningless as the price of monthly rent has already risen on the market. As it has already increased a lot and the owners can not afford to raise it as well, Professor Go Seong-soo of Konkuk University said, market changes will come more in the time frame as each multiple home owners have different characteristics.◇ Or are you selling now?Some experts predict that future sales will pour as multiple owners, who were reluctant to sign up for the rental register, chose to sell. That is what the government intended. The message of the August 2 Real Estate Policy was to sell the house by April next year if you have multiple homes. Since April next year, people with multiple homes will have to pay a substantial amount of tax. There is no benefit from long-term retention. It gave them time to dispose of multiple homes before the measures were implemented.The measures to boost rental housing have been drawing keen attention to the contents and level of the apartments, as they provide a single exit for multiple home owners in such situations. The real estate market has been closely watching whether it can avoid the burden of capital gains taxes while maintaining multiple homes. The report says that some tax breaks do not meet the market's expectations if you rent more than eight years. The government's choice of such a level is another message. "" If you don't like this condition, sell your house now. "" has left many worries for multiple home owners over the next four months. Are you going to stay as a rental operator for an 8 year limited rental rate or dispose of your home before capital gains taxes are enforced or not? After the measures were taken on Aug 2, "" Let's stay on the pitch "" was the prevailing in the market. Many regions say that the sale of rice is rather dry, although both capital gains taxes and implementation approaches. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport is also aware of the situation. Another possible move could occur next year when "" Let's stay on the go "" becomes mainstream. As we announced the plan, Minister of Land Minister Kim Hyun-mi said, We will either impose taxes on multiple homeowners security deposits through a special committee on tax and financial reform next year or impose a comprehensive tax plan on property taxes.

"A huge "" expensive rock fall "" shaped wall has been installed on the road, crossing the top of Geumgok-ri, Beobwon-eup, Paju, Gyeonggi-do, Korea In case of emergency, it is a military facility to destroy it by blasting and prevent the loading of enemy tanks. Since most of the wall in the subway is built on roads that are old and close to civilian life, systematic management and inspection are needed.A ' High Roll-Rolling ' tram barrier installed at the border point of Seoul and Goyang City, Gyeonggi Province, near Freedom Bridge in Gayang, can be seen. Dozens of concrete blocks installed on the ceiling are visible in case of emergency. It is estimated that the concrete weight is one meter by one meter and 1.5 m, and that it weighs 3-4 tons.Traffic is carelessly passing under the wall of a tram guard at liberty. As most of the wall guards are set up on roads close to civilian life, they need systematic and reasonable inspection and management.On a leisurely country road in Wollong-ri, Wollong-myeon, Paju, a ‘ road rock fall ’ shaped wall stands like a relic. As road systems develop, the locations of previously installed anti tank barriers have often lost their military effectiveness.When driving along the roads in Gangwon Province or northern Gyeonggi Province, one of the most common things you will encounter is the wall of anti-tank protection. As a military operation facility to delay the arrival of enemy tanks by destroying the tram barrier, concrete blocks were erected on either side of the road as barriers, and high price drops in the shape of tunnels. It is known that more than 100 stores are currently in the north of the replay.Questions have been mounting about the tactical effectiveness of these "" outdated "" barriers during the pre-grounding era, in which high-tech weaponry from the Army, Navy and Air Force is being used.Another reason for the high effectiveness is the growing number of by-pass roads to Seoul since the 1970s and 80s when the wall against tanks was intensively installed. Even though it accepts the military's logic of "" still better than nothing, "" the question of large-scale concrete on roads that are close to civil safety will bite. # Structural structures over 30 years old, are they safe?The anti tank barrier was installed mainly on the road leading from the front area to Seoul from the 1970s to the 1980s when the Seoul Fortress Plan was established.Some of them were demolished and rebuilt, but most of them are old and have been installed for over 30 years.Paju, Gyeonggi Province, has 41 or 77 percent of 53 anti tank barriers installed before the 1980s.Concrete structures become less robust over time.Considering that apartments are 30 years old, the structural weakness of the wall installed before the 1980s could have already reached a serious level.The potential for ground subsidence is also raised as the vibrations and loads generated during the traffic have been accumulated for a long time.Park Jong-kook, head of the Citizen's Safety and Inspection Center, stressed, "" Concrete strength can withstand partial ground subsidence, but when it is weakened, non-destructive testing and when it reaches the limit, it can collapse immediately. ""北 The military operating system, most of which is under the control of the southern part of tanks, is managed as an excuse for concrete structures security facilities over 30 years old and the management of "" square "" local government units, "" arm of military units, "" but the main battle tank barrier is closed to the blind due to "" security facilities. "" Local governments that manage road construction are keeping their hands open, saying, "" It belongs to the military and the military units do not seem interested in safety inspections. "" The Hankook Ilbo View & Team looked directly into 20 anti - tank barriers around Paju, Uijeongbu, and Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, where concrete blocks and the edges of the pillars supporting them were corroded and damaged and a retaining wall was split.In some cases, high prices caused leakage on the ceiling of rock rocks and damaged structures. It was questionable whether the security system was right because there wasn't any common warning statements, such as No Access or No Photography. Officials at the Defense Ministry said, Every time the unit operates, it checks the safety of the structure visually, but they don`t have the same experience as experienced soldiers who have worked in the front. I don`t remember doing any safety checks except for shooting drills in case of emergency, said Chun (45), an Army officer.A tank barrier left damaged by the ceilingRoad Rollrock with corroded concrete blocks and support parts. Myeongseong-myeon, Pocheon-siIn some cases, reinforcing steel was exposed from the divided retaining wall. Paju, Seoul. The stone-rocking operation steel structures of a road rock fall called ' Security Facility ' are being left damaged. Yeongsong-ri, Yeongjung-myeon, Pocheon-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea# How can you resist an earthquake?After the Gyeongju and Pohang earthquakes, some experts warned of possible strong earthquakes in the metropolitan area, but no anti-seismic designs were applied to the wall. Most of them are old and designed to be destroyed in case of an emergency, so we can`t have any concept of an earthquake, a ministry official said.A concrete block 1 m long by 1 m high and 2 m high can only weigh 4.6 tons, making it vulnerable to an earthquake in the case of a rockslide on a post 20 cm thick and without reinforcing steel. High price falling rocks with heavy traffic may cause more serious damage in the event of a strong earthquake. In the case of a rock fall with high price on Freedom, 250,000 vehicles pass by, the nation's largest number of vehicles, on Monday. It is estimated that the high price of litholith at Freedoah is loaded with more than 120 tons each.# Isn't this a car accident trigger?Accidents often occur in front of barriers, either because lanes are suddenly closed or because of columns built on dedicated road surfaces. In some cases, people who pass through a pedestrian barrier feel at risk of their lives because walking paths are not secured only when they sharply release the handle. There is also the possibility of the structure becoming weak due to the collision of a large, high-speed vehicle.Scratches left on the ceiling of the high rock rock face support this concern.Traffic is carelessly passing under the wall of a tram guard at liberty. As most of the wall guards are set up on roads close to civilian life, they need systematic and reasonable inspection and management.A car is going the opposite direction on Line No. 9 in Yeongsong-ri, Yeongjung-myeon, Pocheon-si. When expanding roads, the road is frequently blocked by cracks, as falling rocks on new roads are installed without removing existing ones (left).Military trucks and excavators cross the road in Dupo-ri, Papyeong-myeon, Paju. The existing wall of tram protection has caused the road to expand abnormally.A resident walks past an expensive rock fall in Naeyu-dong, Deogyang-gu, Goyang-si. There is always a danger of accidents because walking trails are not properly secured.On the ceiling of the trolley barrier against the freedom, there are still marks of scratching and hitting by large vehicles.# Removal, not a chance?The military barrier, such as car accidents, congestion, and images in front of the train, has caused a flurry of complaints, but only local governments face it.Even if the government wants to remove or relocate them, they can not be carried out easily due to the military's incompatibility and budget issues.It takes a long time to dismantle and renovate the entire budget since it is a security-related facility and we can not do anything without cooperation from the military, an official at the Gyeonggi Provincial Office said.The anti tank barrier, which has kept it at risk between security and reality, could pose a threat to the safety of citizens at any time unless systematic and reasonable management is carried out. A change in the military attitude to meet the needs of the times, such as the inspection, demolition, and relocation of structures, is urgently needed.Kim Joo-young, reporter of the Korea Train Protection will@hankookilbo.com Park Seo-ja pindropper@hankookilbo.com Roads, Juwon-ri, Changsu-myeon, Pocheon-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea There is a sign board for military units near a wall.Korea Daily Facebook."

However, Cheong Wa Dae says there is no need to give a special meaning to this.A senior presidential official told reporters at the local press center on July 13, "" It has no special meaning. It depends on how we allocate the time.Other presidential aides also explained that although the summit was usually carried out in the order of ` expanding alone `, it could be changed if the two countries consulted on a schedule and agenda, not on any set rules.The official said, "" In view of past summit cases, I was very careful about the fairness of the summit, so I would like to ask that the attendants who were present at the meeting be given a formal welcome ceremony (which was then a small summit meeting in order) were to discuss and send them to the summit. ""The first is the president and the small summit after summit talks of a broad agenda between the two countries in the discussion moved to more frank.Appears to have to talk.A presidential official said, "" We often explain to the general public that the summit talks with the prime minister is short, and in the case of an expanded summit (with multiple members), more agenda items are on the table, and if the power of the communist bloc is focused on a single summit meeting, it is usually the case of summit meeting. ""High-ranking officials such as when I saw in ""a small meeting, the (president will be talking) want to do a little more the door"" he said, "" as a matter of form than talking in front of a lot of people.Reduced the number is to talk more freely in front of people, said.Small summits usually have less than five people from each side. It is known that the Korean government will introduce its national security chief Jeong EuI-yong, Chang Ha-sung, and Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa to the conference room.This summit between the two countries in the president and the political, economic, social and cultural and people-to-people exchange for normalization of relations as soon as possible in all areas, such as is expected to discuss.

Gwangju City and the May 18 Memorial Foundation are investigating excavation near the Naerijae Tunnel on July 14. The excavation area is located about 30-40 meters from the exit of the tunnel in the direction of Hwasun and Gwangju. A similar reflection from the human skull was detected 60cm below ground level (boundary line of bedrock and road induced layer) in an analysis of the GPC-Ground Penetrating Radar (GPUs). When Gwangju removes asphalt covering the streets, memorial foundations will dig up the land about 4m by 4m deep and explore the ground to find traces of the rocky market. The results of the excavation research are expected to come out as early as this afternoon. Police and food teams are waiting to be found at the scene to protect themselves from harm. Shortly after the attack, soldiers buried gunnysack bags using excavators and other heavy equipment in broad daylight, and saw the head of the body sticking out of the bags, according to reports. In May 1980, the tunnel was shot down by seven offense pilots and the two men who were taken disappeared. According to the report by the Unification Ministry in 2007 and the Boansa, the seven-man man killed one 2.5-ton man and shot a truck from Hwasun to Gwang-ju on May 22, 1980 at the entrance of the Naerijae tunnel. However, the identity and whereabouts of the person who was killed during the incident have not been confirmed. The foundation will also explore the parking areas near Narijae with the cooperation of the Dong-gu Office. guggy@newsis.com>"
"▽ Loan Report by the Bank of Korea : A 1-percent increase in mortgage rates resulted in a 1.5 percent increase in household loans, meaning that the U.S. interest rate would go up and Korean housing prices would not increase significantly. Some say that the same report on financial stability, which was released two weeks after the first rate increase in six years and five months, was intended to raise the interest rate next year. As the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to raise the interest rate three times next year, the stance of global austerity is gaining momentum. However, the necessity of risk management was emphasized as the ratio of total debt payment to total debt (DSR) increases as interest rates were increased among the low-income bracket, people over 50, and self-employed people. It is also said that multiple homeowners who are blamed for the debt of households are not free from the effects of the rate hikes. According to the report on financial stability submitted by the Bank of Korea on July 14, the average increase in lending rates by one percentage point and the interest burden of banks is not high, however, would mean a rise of 1.5 percentage point for household borrowers. It was estimated that 60.9 percent of the DSRs rise to less than 1 percent. The report also showed that the points for those who score between 1 to 5 percent and 33.4 percent and those for those over 5 percent were 5.7 percent. The central bank used micro-data of one million people in its household debt database. Companies have also shown that the increase in interest rates does not add much to the burden of paying down their debts. If lending rates of companies (listed and listed companies) rise by one percentage point from 3.51 % (the first half of this year) to 4.51 % (the first half of this year), the interest coverage ratio falls from 9.0 to 7.9. However, the central bank believes that the level of interest coverage is still good, considering the average level of 4.8 from 2012 to 2016. Their annual interest burden will grow 14.2 %, with small - and medium-sized businesses estimated that the interest burden would rise 17.7 %, or 14.0 %, from their larger counterparts. The level of debt payment burden on both households and businesses due to a one-percent increase in interest rates is usually tolerable, given income, financial assets and the size of operating profit, the BOK said. It also predicted the Bank of Korea will be able to survive even if the U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates rapidly and the domestic housing price falls sharply. To test the resilience of the local banks, the central bank attributed the fact that the Fed's currency policy normalization was higher than the forecast, while domestic housing prices declined 10 percent. At that time, the ratio of the total capital of Korean banks to payments and banks was reduced by 2.1 percent from 15.4 percent to 13.3 percent at the end of the third quarter. Despite the shock at home and abroad, the Korean banks ` resilience is generally good, the BOK said.The weak link in interest rate hikes was also hit by low-income, elderly and self-employed … = The weak link in raising interest rates was still pointed out as the detonator for household debt. When looking at the DSR increase, the proportion of low-income people in the bottom 30 percent, people over the age of 50, and self-employed was significantly higher. When the interest rate on loans was raised by 1 percentage point, the percentage of those in the low-income bracket was 32.4 percent, up from the previous five percent level. For those in their 50s and older, 53.6 % answered that, which is 2.5 times more than the rate of those in their 30s (21.5 %). Private businesses saw their share of employees rise less than 1 percentage point to 21.4 percent, three times higher than that of the group whose percentage was 7.1 percent. In addition, high-risk lending groups, including credit loans with interest rates of more than 20 percent at savings banks and payments of more than 200 million won at a time, accounted for 32.3 percent of total lending at DSR points or higher. The low-return, low-income, and low-paid car account for 12.0 percent of the total. In total, DSR increases were less than one percent, far higher than the figure of 8.0 percent and 6.2 percent. Multiple home owners, who are blamed for the nation`s mounting household debt, were also expected to face a blow from the rate hikes. In many cases, the increase in the DSR was higher than 5 percent in the number of borrowers. In particular, multiple home mortgage loan holders whose mortgage loan balance increased by 69.4 percent since the third quarter of 2013, when the low interest rate was set at a higher rate, more than double the previous three percent. Multiple home owners were generally quoted as having a good repayment rate for their principal and interest compared to disposable income, which takes into consideration financial assets. The number of multiple home owners stood at 1.89 million, or 14.9 percent of the total home owners. Their home is 4.87 million, accounting for 31.5 percent of all homes. Although the increase in credit loans is being made, it has been revealed that financial institutions are increasing household credit loans but reducing loans to people with low credit rating. It is because it is concerned about the lack of credit information and damage to the credit reputation of the low-user. According to the report, Korea`s financial institutions borrowed 212.8 trillion won from household credit loans at the end of last quarter. Credit loans refer to the use of loans from financial institutions without collateral and with individual credit alone. Since they only borrow on credit, the interest rate is higher than that of mortgage loans. Household credit loans reached 210 trillion won ($ 199 billion) in the third quarter of this year, up from the previous year`s end. Household credit loans are on the rise, but financial institutions are reducing low-consumption loans and increasing the number of low-users. From early 2015 to September 2015, the proportion of credit loans to the banks for credit extended by 8.7 % (p). Meanwhile, the portion of loans to the CITIC decreased by 6 percent and the proportion of credit delinquents decreased by 2.7 percent during the same period. Non-bank financial institutions saw their lending to shareholders drop by 0. 0.3p and that of low-users decreased by 5. 5.4. Financial institutions cut down on lending to middle and low borrowers and raised rates because of the lack of credit information that could result in losing money. Among those using synthetic media, 62.1 percent of those who have never had access to a bank account in three years and lack credit information, which includes no credit card history. It is interpreted that the financial institutions reduced the number of credit loans they borrowed due to the lack of credit information to judge whether or not they borrowed the loans. To improve the deepening market division in the household credit market and the persistence of the interest rate gap between businesses, efforts need to continue to reduce the asymmetry in information, a BOK official said.

"" Prosecutors requested 25 years in jail, a penalty of 185 billion won, and a surcharge of 77.19735 billion won to Choi Soon-sil. Under the current law, the maximum jail term is 30 years. Prosecutors ordered the prosecution to pay 25.22 billion won in fines, or twice the amount of fines, in return for the seven years it has already demanded in the corruption case involving two universities, and in return for paying 25.28 billion won in fines. In fact, he apparently stressed that he wanted to estimate the maximum amount of time spent in jail for organic labor.

"Dong-A Ilbo : [Children's Center for the Living in Schools] = The Ministry of Education, which identified idle classrooms by hand, examined the number of elementary schools nationwide and opened with 17 municipal and provincial education offices this year. Considering the number of elementary school students and the number of schools that have continued to decrease, it is smaller than expected. "" In order to achieve 40 percent of the national and public kindergartens rates, we need to have 600 preschool rooms if there are empty, "" said Kim Sang-gon, the minister of social affairs and education at The Dong-A Ilbo on July 12. The logic is that there are no free classrooms to use as children's houses in schools. Is it really so? A bag bearer climbs the stairs at an elementary school in Jongno-gu, Seoul yesterday. The Seoul Old Dosim School is on the verge of consolidating its student pool due to the "" urbanization "" of its schools. Critics say the education authorities should prepare measures to utilize empty classrooms. Kim Jae-myung, a reporter at base@donga.com and the Ministry of Education, calculated by empty classroom statistics, are close to the "" elastic statistics "" that vary according to school responses. According to the Education Ministry's report to National Assembly Education, Culture, Sports and Tourism Committee member Roh Woong-rae, the class status of idle classrooms during the nation's trial period was 6162. The number of elementary schools is 6.6, or 934, empty classrooms announced by the Ministry of Education. According to the data, the number of empty classrooms in Seoul was 86, a far cry from the previous 27. The ministry has defined idle classrooms as those with no future plans, and the numbers are correct at 27, said an official at the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education. Gwangju Metropolitan Office of Education reported that the number of elementary schools was 55, with 186 empty classrooms, said an official at the ministry. Among them, many are used as after-school classrooms. Based on the poor statistics, the ministry has insisted that there are "" no empty classrooms. "" The definition of an empty classroom is not clear. Each study shows whether the classrooms that are only used after school or stacked with data or luggage are empty, and whether or not the classrooms to be used in a year are empty, and if the statistics differ from one to the other. Schools that are not happy to use empty classrooms are conservatively counted if possible. The Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education has been conducting a project to save small schools in 8 schools since this year, with the number of students less than 200, which are on the verge of consolidation. Among them, less than half of the nation's 23.4 students per class, and some schools have built a school historical view using empty classrooms. Of course, these small schools with empty classrooms did not appear on the empty classroom list either. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Education is passive in identifying the current situation of elementary, middle and high schools. Jeong Young-mo, a professor at Hanyang University's Education and Welfare Policy Center, said, "" If the government, which leads the policy on low fertility rates, fails to grasp the current situation of idle classrooms, it is hard to doubt whether it will solve the problem or not. "" ○ The education sector is facing a sharp shift in the demand for classrooms, while education circles insist that the demand for empty classrooms, such as after school classrooms and classrooms, has continued to decrease, leaving not many empty classrooms empty. Additional classroom demands due to the curriculum reform and policy changes were steady, said an official at the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education. If you look closely at the school situation, it will not be easy to explain. Only five (27) schools answered that they have empty classrooms out of the most expensive schools in Seoul that are for children to buy. Even these schools said, "" We don't have classrooms to accommodate children in schools. "" "" We are talking about regular classrooms for after-school classes, "" and "" We have 6 underground classrooms scheduled to be used by Seoul National University students. We had a few empty classrooms due to redevelopment, but when we moved in one or two years later, we ran out of classrooms, said D Elementary School, an elementary school building in Seoul, and also closed temporarily in March next year. As a result, many school presidents consider school as an asset that is not reserved for the public assets of their community but only for school members. "" When we investigated the demand for kindergarten in the district, no one said they needed kindergartens, "" an official of the ruling party said, adding, `` They were surprised to see that they needed more schools. '' Education authorities say the central government is pushing for a low birthrate after school, nursing classrooms and passed the budget on to the education office, while schools say it is a trauma that led to heavier administrative burden. "" Even though I agree that the schools are state-owned, "" one principal said, when the kindergarten came, the office was to administer two schools, and its nutrition and health teachers doubled. Still, many say that the government should seriously consider the possibility of using empty classrooms amid the decline in the number of students in school. The number of elementary school students nationwide dropped to 720,000 in 2010 from 4,000,000,000,000 in 2000 and 2,320,000,000 in 2011, and this year, decreased by tens of thousands every year since 2011. On the other hand, the number of schools and classrooms has increased steadily. Schools that have a good location with excellent accessibility are condemned to have more empty classrooms ahead.Ugyeongim woohaha@donga.com, and ▶ ▶ Facebook official solo Dong-A Ilbo and Dong-A Ilbo reporters gimhagyeong hot area, all how financial and economic issues (Click!) © 5 Kits combine the Dong-A Ilbo.& donga com, unauthorized war damage and redistribution of Korean photographer who were beaten by Chinese security officials (= Beijing, Yonhap News Agency) Wednesday morning, Moon Jae-in president the exercise of a state visit.A South Korean photographer who was covering Beijing center of the National Council for b China unilaterally how they were beaten to a security official in the hall.

"© news 120 years holed up most of the suspect about 46 billion damage of Education 'Fraud' (= 1 News, Seoul, Korea) bakttonghae reporters are to the Philippines and police commit a crime here.47 The Koreans fleeing and repatriation through the last century. The National Police Agency announced on July 14 that the 47 suspects who committed fraud, drugs, and violence and escaped to the Philippines, where they are relatively less secure than Korea, will be transferred to Incheon International Airport around 4:00 p.m. on that day. Among the 47 suspects, 39 are convicted of fraud, resulting in about 46 billion won in damages. It also includes one drug criminal, one violent offender and one thief, and Interpol's red wanted criminal. The oldest suspect in the Philippines, identified as "" A, "" fled to the Philippines in November 1997 and was extradited to Korea for legal punishment after 20 years. One of the virtual currency fraud rings worth 30 billion won was also listed on the repatriation list.Police decided to repatriate the offenders after they were found necessary to secure legal justice and stabilize ethnic Koreans living in the Philippines by establishing them in Korean courts amid the growing number of fugitive criminals in the country. After arriving at Incheon International Airport, each of the suspects will board a convoy through immigration procedures and be transferred to the police station responsible for the incident. Police will send about 120 people to Incheon International Airport for repatriation. Police officials said it was "" important to ensure that all of the various variables involved in the transport are prevented, as it is the repatriation of criminal groups using the nation's first charter plane. "" Meanwhile, the Philippines is geographically close to the Republic of Korea and has poor security, leading many Korean suspects to flee after their crimes or make themselves home to international crimes. In fact, the Philippines is the country where Korean criminals have fled the most (144 out of 485 people) in the world in 2017. Police then conducted a series of international cooperation investigations along with Philippine law enforcement authorities and the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in Phillippin, and as of November this year, 90 Koreans were imprisoned at the Phillippines Foreign Receptions Center. The number of those who were extradited to Korea has also increased from 33 in 2014 to 91 this year. However, 47 who will be sent back are expected to be included in next year`s repatriation statistics.Report to the Public Service Department : [Undisputable and redistributed surgery on (news1.kr),] Mobile hospital's "" Up to 100 beds … Inspiration into Emergency Medical Center "" is now available at the National Medical Center in Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province. Korea`s first mobile hospital is expected to play a central role in the devastated disaster scene, as it can be built with up to 100 beds of casualties. The Ministry of Health and Welfare and the National Medical Center announced on July 14 that they will hold the launch ceremony of a mobile hospital at a modular factory in Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province. Mobile hospitals are equipped with facilities in general hospitals, including emergency rooms, operating rooms, intensive care units, inpatients, outpatients, diagnostic laboratories, CT rooms, restaurants, and accommodation, and are manufactured with a basic capacity of 50 beds. By using attached tents, the size can be increased to 100 beds. Features are made by functional module. Customizable operation is possible from small form that enables rapid transport to maximum size with functions such as operation, critical care, and operation of the hospital. Health and Medical Policy Division Director Kang Do-tae of the ministry said in a congratulatory speech, "" Mobile hospitals are equipped with excellent facilities and equipment infrastructure that can compare with other developed countries. "" The ministry will send mobile hospitals to the scene in case of disaster and make them available to the Emergency Medical Support Team (DMAT).

As so-called ' diggers ' seeking to produce virtual money were mining virtual bills, wasting enormous amounts of resources in cloud services.The cloud is a virtual storage that can be used only when connected to the Internet, and businesses are operating a service to lend cloud servers. Virtual money mining involves a repeat of the operation to calculate specific numbers. To mine a lot, we need to have hundreds of computers and expensive hardware, such as high-performance graphics cards. The electricity consumed is also significant. That is why many are trying to ease the burden on virtual servers.According to the information technology industry on July 14, NHN Entertainment will introduce a prohibition on the extraction of virtual currency into the "" toast cloud "" use clause next month. Naver also revised its cloud service clauses late last October to prohibit the mining of virtual currency using free licenses or free servers. Most companies use computer resources for speculative purposes, so it can not be seen as normal service use. In many cases, they use the cloud service, which pays off late payment, to the point of paralysis for a short period of time, and then disappear without an settlement. The process of extracting virtual currency is easily understood to be the solution of high-degree math problems, but with the total amount of money set, it is designed to compute more and more money to get a unit of virtual currency.

The company also built a paper keyboard that prints case-sensitive to the intensity of the user's touch. Lee Jae-rim, a reporter at the Korea Research Foundation (Yonhap News Agency), wrote a keyboard with paper and pencils, which Korean researchers can easily access around them, in order to create a better keyboard. The Korea Research Foundation announced on July 14 that Professor Shim Woo-young and Professor Lee Tae-yoon of Yonsei University developed an advanced 3D touch sensor. In recent academic circles, pressure sensors are actively being researched to create artificial microstructure on the surface to increase sensitivity and flexibility to the age of the Internet of things. To create surface microstructure, it is usually via complicated processes such as photo lithography, deposition, and etching. Of course, the cost of manufacturing is also high. The research team began by using the rough nature of paper surfaces. It may seem a little odd, but the paper is cheap and can be made into a large size, so it is worth challenging, the researchers said. The result was success. The research team produced a pressure sensor for worry by utilizing the roughness of the paper itself without the need for a separate surface microstructure. There is a fine bend in the paper. When two sheets of paper overlap, the bumps make a thin layer of air between the paper without completely sticking to the side. The team made electrodes on the paper surfaces with pencils and applied a thin layer of solvent mix PDMS, which acted as a gene. A dielectric is an insulator that becomes polar in an electric field. Based on this, capacitive pressure sensors were implemented. Static electricity flow The two sheets of paper were easily crushed by the fine curvature of the surface to maximize pressure sensing, the team explained. It can distinguish the weight of a grain of rice. While being thrown away, the researchers even made paper keyboards. Each key was configured with individual pressure sensors to recognize the crushing strength. It even has the ability to print upper - and lower-case characters based on the number of user touches. Of course it is thin, light and flexible. As stability of bending was also present, the team did not suffer performance degradation even after bending more than 1,000 times. Professor Shim Woo-young is confident that he presented a new paradigm for pressure sensor research without the artificial microstructure construction process, saying, It could be widely applied to wearables and the Internet of things. Research was carried out with support from the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Korea Research Foundation (Research by individual and group). The research results were published as a cover paper on July 14 in the International Journal of Academic Arts. The research team is planning to distribute the piles of paper to the necessary acquaintances and dispose of the rest of the paper. ▶ walden@yna.co.kr article reports latest fashion trends and (Click!) contact area, all (Click!) choesunsil the final trial (pg) [made Cho Hye In] senior and Shin Dong-bin illustration, composite photos anjongbeomLotte Group, on trial with final sentence of January next year expected … 崔 chojungsun choesunsil, Park Geun-hye sights, the court granted bail to (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) Mr. yundongjin.Journalist : government 'nasal glands power' Park Geun-hye choesunsil a.m. on July 13, Seocho-gu, Seoul Central District Court in gukjjeong nongdan relevant head to attend the trial to court cases.to exist 2017.12.13 mon@yna.co.kr( : Seoul, Yonhap News Agency) songjinwon reporters are brought on by the constitutional president of the first impeachment gukjjeong nongdan, a key figure in the incident 'nasal glands power' choesunsil the trial.Sentiments are 14, will be completed.

Woo arrived at the courthouse at 10:18 a.m. before reviewing the warrant, answering, `` Do you still think the illegal surveillance operations are directly related to the affairs of the civil affairs chief? '' Prosecutors and Woo argued fiercely over the reasons for the arrest, its necessity and its validity.

Regarding Woo's assertion that the temple is the work of ordinary senior secretary for civil affairs, we can not avoid the responsibility of being an incompetent person who insists it was a legal site, said a prosecution official. We are not investigating the civil affairs affairs affairs affairs secretary post, but the illegal surveillance operations, he added. Meanwhile, former senior prosecutor Woo argued against the prosecution's claim, saying, "" We have never ordered the NIS to inspect illegally in the process of issuing a warrant and only carried out the ordinary duties of the Senior Civil Affairs Secretary. "" Wu insisted, "" We only had normal business communication with Choo Myung-ho, the former director of the NIS who is suspected of acting as a practioner of illegal inspections, and we never ordered any illegal inspections.

If the task force led by the former chief of the NIS, Woo, and the ministry sends a list of targets to the NIS, the NIS decided to investigate whether to establish a joint investigation. In addition, Woo is accused of ordering the National Intelligence Service to investigate groups belonging to the Korean Federation of Science and Technology Associations, and the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, Cho Hee-yeon, among others. Since last fall, Woo has been questioned five times by prosecutors and special prosecutors Park Young-soo over allegations of high land prices deals with Nexon in the vicinity of Gangnam Station and involvement in the government's agricultural affairs scandal. Two arrest warrants were sought during the process, but all were rejected by the court. In addition, most of the prosecutors were acquitted of corruption cases. However, the prosecution is currently in the first trial, charging him without physical detention in April with involvement in covering up the scandal at Choi Soon-sil Gate and obstructing Lee`s investigation. Former U.S. Chief of Staff Wu is considered the last remaining key figure in the NIS ' alleged involvement in various Korean politics during the past administration. Prosecutors, who have been investigating the NIS scandal for four months since August, are speeding up their investigation with a goal to complete their probe of key figures this year. Prosecutors are focusing on securing new recruits because they believe Woo's arrest is a key criterion for determining the results of the NIS investigation. cha@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"["" U.S. Secretary of State for the United States and North Korea Countermeasures Disarmamination…""The U.S. Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and China Present China when U.S. Secretary of State for East Asia and North Korea's Nuclear weapons program begins a massive U.S. joint meeting on July 12 ""He said, "" Even the weather is fine. Let's have a talk without preconditions. "" `` If it's not (fail), it would be (fail) that it would be a successful dialogue for Defense Minister James Matiz. '' The speech was aired live on the U.S. State Department's website. The North proposed to the North.As the host of the seminar asked, "" Aren't you already concerned about the collapse of the North Korean regime and the mass defection from China due to the pressure on North Korea? "" China's top diplomat, Tillardson said. I think China can manage the situation sufficiently."" We (U.S. and Chinese) have also discussed what would have happened inside North Korea, "" he said. "" Most importantly, we do not secure the security of securing North Korea's nuclear program. "" "" We (United States) told China that we would go below the 38th Parallel again if anything had to happen to cross the border, "" he said. "" That's what we promised China. ""A senior U.S. think tank official at the seminar said, "" Minister Tillerson's comment was meant to be a pledge to keep the secret from the Pentagon, "" adding, "" It is very clear that we have made the most of the pressures public. ""Tillerson did not disclose when he had such a conversation with China, but it is most likely it was during a high-level U.S. - and Chinese-Chinese diplomatic security meeting in Washington in June. At that time, Tillarson, Mattis and Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Yang Jiechi, chief of the People's Liberation Army's Army General, were present.After the meeting ended, the United States told China to "" intensify the pressure on North Korea, "" and China's report that "" the two sides (both sides of the Korean Army) had stopped fighting with North Korea and U.S. military drills at the same time. "" However, it appears that the two sides had a detailed discussion, going into each of the issues after the collapse of North Korea.Indeed, the U.S. and China have recently been preparing for the situation after the collapse of North Korea. Last week, Weibo showed that the Chinese government is planning to build five North Korean refugee camps in Jilin province, a border region. Changbai County is located between the Yalu River and facing Hyesan City in North Korea`s Yanggangdo and Samjiyeon counties.Washington Post columnist David Ignatius said at last month`s U.S.-China summit that Tillerson had kept his nuclear weapons in a safe and confidential manner in case the North Korean regime collapsed. It is possible that the issue was raised to the summit following high-level talks in June and has continued to fine-tune the details.Tillerson's comments to China, "" I promised to go back to North Korea, even if it happened, "" appear to be an attempt to gauge China's involvement in the military action. A senior South Korean official who had a series of contacts with U.S. intelligence officials in October said, "" The biggest concern for the United States was whether or not China would participate in the military action against North Korea, "" adding, "" It has prevented China from engaging in many combat activities. "" A senior U.S. State Department official at the time told the high-ranking official, "" There is a 40 percent chance of military action. ""Some Chinese are also insisting that they should prepare for the next collapse of the Kim Jong Un administration due to U.S. military action. In September, Jachinguo, director of the International Relations Department at Beijing University, wrote in an interview with Australia's East Asia Forum that, "" China could start a war on the Korean Peninsula by cooperating with the United States and Korea. In the article, he suggested handling North Korea`s nuclear weapons, responding to the influx of refugees, recovering North Korea`s social order and reorganizing its regime as key tasks of his emergency plan.

Footprints from Cheonjeon-ri and Daegok-ri are representative dinosaur footprints from the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic Era. Important natural history data confirmed as a group habitat and walking matrix for plant-eating dinosaurs, sauropod and sculptors. There were 71 dinosaur footprints and 9 fossils found in Daegok-ri, Cheonjeon-ri, each. The city government conducted a basic academic research to assess the weathering and damage of fossil rock from June to December last year before preserving dinosaur footprints.Dinosaurs ' Foot Fossil in Cheonjeon-ri, Ulsan = Yonhap News Agency (Ulsan = Yonhap News Agency), announced Monday that it has been preserved and placed near Cheonjeon-ri, National Treasure No.147 As a result, the opinions of neighboring trees, grass, and soil were removed and cracks made by weathering were necessary. Based on this, the city removed the traces of rock and the soil around the dinosaur footprints from August until recently and cleaned the fossil. The cracks in the fossil were filled with elasticity. The elastic resin acts to slow the progression of the fractures in the fossil by preventing water ingress within the fossil and by providing an elastic rebound in the rock's floating space during the thawing. The fossils were difficult to clean because they were so rich in moss, said Park Hae-woon, head of Culture and Art Division at Ulsan Metropolitan City, who said, dinosaur footprints are expected to be spotlighted as a tourist attraction and natural treasure No. 147 nearby. leeyoo@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"▽ Gidinet Korea = Cho Jae-hwan, reporter of the Korea Community Center, has raised awareness of the spread of electric cars.Owners ' complaints about electric car charging are divided broadly into _ parking in the charging space of an internal combustion engine vehicle _ and long-stopped electric vehicles ▲ charger failures and malfunctions after the charging time. It is a phenomenon arising from the failure to come up with a related bill to charge electric cars in a stable and convenient manner.A bill banning the parking of electric car charging areas for internal-combustion vehicles (some revisions to the law to promote the development and supply of environment-friendly cars) is not likely to be passed in the regular Congress this year, and is likely to remain uncomfortable next year.Seoul's first new concept electric car charging station filled with internal combustion vehicles. One month after completion, it is still called & apos ; paralysed charging stations & apos. (Photo : Jidinet Korea) ■ Because of the regular car ... The owner of an affected electric car, charged electric car owner B, recently experienced awkward business at the Namhae Express Highway Service Center in Gimhae, South Gyeongsang Province. That's because a police patrol car was stopped near an electric car fast charger. Right next to the police car, no parking spaces were available for charging.In case of electric car charging, it is necessary to open the charger by yourself without any staff at the rest area. To proceed with charging, the surrounding space must be secured to some extent. Eventually, the police car made it difficult for him to proceed with the quick charging process.Police vehicles stopped in front of the electric car charger at Jinyeong Rest Area. This is why many car owners are prevented from charging their cars. (Photo : Electric car owners ' association) A similar case was found often in hotels and shopping malls in Seoul.Gidinet Korea visited Novotel Ambassador Hotel in Nonhyeon-dong, southern Seoul in June to charge its Ionic plug-in hybrid. The hotel has an electric car slow charger and an environmental public quick charger installed in an underground parking lot.In the case of an Ionic plug-in hybrid, the electric car is the only available slow charger. A plug-in hybrid vehicle features that, over a distance, can only run on battery and motor vehicles without the involvement of gasoline engines, such as electric cars.Entering the hotel's ground parking lot, it was confirmed that an internal combustion engine vehicle was parked in front of the charger. When a nearby employee was asked to move the car to charge, the hotel staff said, "" Go underground and recharge. "" This means that hotel employees do not yet know the characteristics of plug-in hybrid cars.Novotel Ambassador Hotel's ground parking lot An electric car charging station is a place where vehicles with internal combustion engines are suffering from valet parking. (Photo : Jidinet Korea) Other owners of electric cars are also pointing out the operating problems of the hotel. Owners of pure electric cars or plug-in hybrid owners who visit the hotel should always leave them empty.The Korean electric car charging station, which was built on Feb. 9 at the I-Park mall in Yongsan, has equipped with 10 fast-charging devices and a slow-down charging station to help ease the charge space inconvenience. The government also held a large-scale event to celebrate the event. Here, & apos ; Molling&apos ; refers to the spending patterns of enjoying cultural experiences and shopping at shopping malls.The station, which began its service on March 2 due to power supply issues, had a serious problem with the internal combustion vehicles. The majority of fast charging stations were filled with regular internal combustion vehicles, with no staff to stop them. Although the plates were set up to recharge the owner of the electric car, they were used as safety first.View of the Molling Electric Vehicle Charging Station in Yongsan, March 5, with the third highest level of internal combustion engines and safety gap (photo).Electric car owner A, who wanted to use the quick charger installed at Hwaseong City Hall in Gyeonggi Province, had several complaints about Hyundai Motor's nose or EV with a stomach membrane attached.The Hwaseong City Hall is about 5km away from the Namyang Institute of Hyundai Kia Motors Corp., and is one of the most popular test runs of pre-release vehicles, including a concealed nose and EVs.Hyundai Motor Co. will release its nose or EVs in the first half of next year frequently appear in areas with many electric car chargers, including the Hwaseong City Hall in Gyeonggi Province and Uiwang Rest Area. It is for domestic charger compatibility tests.Electric car owners A said, "" The Environment Ministry's public quick charger at Hwaseong City Hall is designed to last up to 40 minutes. At the time, the remaining charge time for the nose or EV was 15 minutes, as identified by Mr. A.Hyundai Motor Cona EV.Long in front of the Hwaseong City Hall electric car fast charger.

As a result, many electric cars are left in the running for more than 20 minutes after charging.C, who was about to use the Novotel Amber Sadder Underpass charger in Nonhyeon-dong, had an uncomfortable time due to the Ionik Electric Company parked in the aisle. Parked in an aisle, Ionik Electric used the Ministry of Environment's fast charging machine, but did not move much after the charging was completed.The Ionic Electric Company is believed to have been forced to fast charge down the aisles as internal combustion vehicles were parked in the charging area. "" in the aisle in a parked car, and is “Perhaps seem to be inconvenienced many people. because of the internal combustion engine vehicle of bimaeneo” Mr. c : electric car charging is completed, too.Manners necessary to have to move quickly for the owners, said.Korean cars were also criticized for their fast charging and charging their cars.Electric car owner H photographed the operation of Hyundai Department Store in Cheonho, which is filled with commodity materials around the charger in October. H explained that he could not proceed with charging due to materials surrounding the charger.The parking lot on the fifth floor of the department store, where the charger is installed, is being finished with. Work seemed to be under way to improve the parking lot environment. According to the private electric vehicle charging information infrastructure system, ' EV Infra&apos ;, the charger is a new charger that was reflected last April. Charger prepared prior to environmental improvement work.When Jidinet Korea looks directly into the charger, it can be seen that no parking lines have yet been set up for charging, and carts and materials have been located near the charger. Among electric car owners, the consensus is that we should not install chargers for such operations.Hyundai Department Store Cheonho Store (Photo : Electric Car User's Association), one of the most problematic locations for the material placement around the electric car charger, is unable to arrange an electric parking lot near Hyundai Department Store's Cheonho Parking Lot. (Photo : Jidinet Korea) New concept electric car charging station is also one of the most problematic places in a building near Euljiro 1-ga Station in Seoul.Hanwool Building charging station, which can charge two electric cars with a single charger, has constructed Messeol steel lines for moving the charger cables. It is to emphasize that even when parked, electric cars can be charged by ordinary vehicles in the charging station parking spaces.However, the steel line has become a barrier to the operation of the station. The steel lines were damaged due to the weight of the average internal combustion engine vehicle, and Korea Electric Power could not prepare countermeasures. Eventually, the station has been unable to provide formal service for more than two months since its grand opening on Oct. 13.Kim Seong-tae, head of the Korea Train Use Association, said, "" Starting next year, to avoid problems with charging electric cars, we need to strengthen awareness about the improvement of public awareness, such as the promotion of public interest prevention cars advertising. ""Korea Electric Vehicle Charger, a new concept electric car that was left powered off after one month of construction, is located near Han Building near Eulji-ro 1-ga Station in Seoul."
"There is a store in Seoul's Garak Market that has been closed for two years, and it doesn't get kicked out of the market or even sells tens of millions of won a month.

But one store in the corner is tightly closed.[Sori market merchant : My boss didn't run it. How long have you been out of business?Well, it's old. (I heard it's been about two years.) Yes. It's been a while.] Monthly sales hit below 80 million won or are forced out of the market three months in a row.But this store has been closing for more than two years.[Garak Market Merchant : Let's say you've got a little bit of a boost. (How can you make a difference when you're not in business?) I don't know.] Merchants say that the store's survival secret is the distribution of sales from other stores.[Karak Market Merchant : We didn't get out because we paid more than 80 million won per month to make up for the fake tax bill.] When some stores report their sales in the name of the ghost store, it appears they have made a profit without doing business.The amount is about 920,000 won for two years and seven months. The bogus store pays the tax on the amount of sales you give out.It is not the only store that uses good sister and brother's trick.[Sori market businessman : There are several shops that do things by the expediency of business. If you don't have any results and don't get canceled, you need to get a sale.] Even when paying taxes, the reason why we stop canceling our licenses is because of our huge profits.Though I can not do business as usual, if I do business myself, 5 billion won a year is easy to sell and I can earn more than 1 billion won in profit.[Sori market businessman : If you sell your shop, you'll get billions. It's easy to get 300 to 400 million won in sales a month. What's the annual equivalent of five billion? Lots of money.This ghost store was kicked out in July at the request of merchants.The Seoul Food and Agriculture Minister, who oversees the incident, said that he had never known anything about such an expedient.

A nearby tunnel, where an analysis of the GPC·Ground Penetrating Radar, revealed an reflected wave of rock, similar to human skull, at a depth of 60cm below the ground (boundary of the highbank and road). Although the parking lot of Nerijae Park was dug out for about one meter underground, the team checked out layers of rock. Kim Yang-rae, executive director of the Foundation for the 5th and 18th Anniversary, said, "" I think the abnormal signals captured by the ground survey radar are ultimately irregular rocks. "" "" It is disappointing, but you must find the missing persons. We will continue to explore the land. We have a wide variety of information about the sale, Kim said.

"Design life is 7.8 year....The brilliant activity-based ETRI development-building device life was initially developed by French Guiana National Space Development Agency in the run-up to the launch of the Space Agency on July 12. Lee Jae-rim, a reporter at the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), said, "" The Korea Aerospace Research Institute (Daejeon) first designed the satellite Chollian, which was launched into the sky on June 27, 2010, has not much left in sight. As the satellite communication service is essential for national disasters and emergencies, voices are growing to be urged to launch a satellite after the event. According to the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) on July 14, the first independently developed Cheollian-1 vehicle has performed its mission in the weather, sea, and telecom fields by orbiting a halt. As a public communication satellite, it was utilized for free for the security and people's convenience of Korea, including the Ministry of Public Administration and Security, the Meteorological Administration and Security, and the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. Public broadcaster KBS is using the satellite for disaster test broadcasting in Hongdo, Shinan County, South Jeolla Province.Jeong Yoon-duk, a reporter for the Chollian-Cholline-5 ECA rocket launched into space at 6 a.m. on July 27, 2009, the first geostationary satellite developed by a domestic research and development team, the Aria-5 ECA Space Launch Vehicle.The performance of the communication tower developed by ETRI is also impressive. Through a communication tower, also referred to as Cheollian`s brain, ETRI has performed satellite communication public services, satellite signal measurements, ground terminal tests and satellite control over the past seven years. The communication tower structure developed by ETRI is the ' KaI ' band with frequencies between 20 and 30 gigahertz (GHz) high-frequency band. They are more susceptible to rainfall than the Kuband (14.0 - 14.5 GHz), but they have the benefit of being able to transmit broadband data. The team developed adaptive modem technology to address rain attenuation in the Kaband signals (a phenomenon in which waves or particles absorb and disperse as they pass through the material resulting in a reduction in energy or particle count). The key is to distinguish between rain and rain and change signals automatically.The World Communications Commission (ETRI) senior researcher Jeong Soo-yup (left) and researcher Jeong Dong-hyeon are demonstrating the satellite broadcasting service technologies at 4K - UHDTV satellite, according to the Global Communication Research Center. The report explained that it demonstrates the ability of Korea's communication satellite to develop its own technologies. Kaband Satellite Technology, applied in Cheollian-1, is the next generation core technology that can provide broadband services such as high speed Internet as well as high-definition (UHD) TVs at the beginning of 4K. The U.S. and Europe are also competitively pushing for commercial use. Printed circuit boards (PCB) in tower chains were redesigned as small semiconductor chips to reduce signal loss.ETRI senior researcher Moon Seong-mo (left) and researcher Im Joon-han are also inspecting the communication tower at the satellite research center [ETRI = Yonhap News Agency] also developed the second generation satellite terminal. The satellite service provided to public organizations such as the military, the Korea Coast Guard, and the Small Defense Agency allowed Kabae satellite service to compete with other satellite companies. It also helped businesses perform many experiments for free.The problem with ETRI researchers ' "" Chollian Line 1 carrier "" is that it is nearing the end of its life span. Chollian I was designed to run for up to 7.8 years. This means that it can be stopped any time after the second half of next year. If there is any fuel left, it can be used continuously, but it is not expected to be very long. ETRI has developed a communication tower with a lifespan of 12 years, but it is useless if the satellite is not turned.Chollian 1 shot at 1:16 p.m. on January 24 last year (International Standard Time (UTC time : 4:16 a.m. on July 24). The Yonhap News Center and the Government of the Republic of Korea are in a cold season. However, since it is specialized in the weather and sea fields, many argue that it is urgent to acquire public communication satellite. ETRI officials said although the recently launched satellite is a communication satellite, further countermeasures against public-public communication satellites are needed because it is commercial, and disaster, such as earthquake and typhoon, is sure to occur when dealing with North Korea. walden@yna.co.kr Through this, the company is planning to create a new market for electronic documents worth 600 billion won by 2021 and to save economic costs by 1.1 trillion won. In addition, the school plans to focus on supplying 3D printers to spread 3D printing. The government held the 9th IT Strategy Committee on July 14 and strengthened its policies for utilizing electronic documents to realize the society without a paper, such as the "" Deposition Plan for Use of electronic documents "" and "" Realization of cyber life safety "". NH Investment & Securities employees work with electronic documents. First of all, the government is planning to make the society what it has been creating by drastically reducing the use of paper documents that have been inefficient economically and socially. To that end, the Act introduced a regulation that clearly defines the effectiveness of electronic documents, and therefore considers electronic documents to be in writing. Under the regulation, over 1400 statutes, all types of documents, documents, documents, and documents required for submission can be written, stored or submitted as electronic documents. Double-storage electronic documents and paper documents, which have traditionally been carried out by financial institutions, are also being improved. Accordingly, when electronic documents are kept at an authorized electronic documentation center, paper documents can be disposed of, which will save not only money but also improve the efficiency of the business. Moreover, the system has been completely reformed to have the same legal effect as paper registration. We have been talking with the Justice Ministry and the financial ministry for a long time about reviving electronic documents, said Yang Hwan-jung, director of the ministry`s Information and Communication Policy Division, which created a new electronic document market worth KRW 100 trillion by 2021. The government is set to expand its base to make 3D printing more practical. To that end, the government will gradually distribute 3D printers to schools in front of schools in cooperation with the education office. By 2020, the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education and the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education will be distributing 3D printers to 500 schools and expanding the coverage nationwide. To support the professional utilization of 3D printing, the government will also implement national certification systems, including 3D printer development industry engineers and 3D printer operator. "" With software training, we can create movable programs such as robots and cars, and with 3D printing, we can design and print the shape we want for the next five hundred and sixty million won. "" In addition, the government will strengthen its response to the growing number of Ransonware attacks. To that end, the government is planning to strengthen the inspection of the backup system and provide support to enhance the level of information protection for small businesses. In particular, the government will establish an early response system 24 hours ago to block the land spread abroad and develop vaccines upon the detection of lansumwear. In addition, it will provide Ransom Ware response guides and establish a dedicated support system to effectively respond to the infection of Ransonware. syj@fnnews.com reporter Seo Young-jun, "" fnpas, "" the story of every goal in the world, is what you see in the entertainment news."

"After the breakdown of the Korea-Japan Fisheries Negotiation last year, fishermen were required to fix mackerel pickers to raise oil prices by "" catch more than 28cm "" in a joint fishing box in Busan on July 11. [Photo : Korea Fisheries Resource Management Corporation] "" We want to catch baby mackerel. It's only one tenth of the price of big mackerel ... But if we want to get gas, we can't help but save it. "" More than 90 percent of the mackerel caught in the Western European Union market on July 11. 100,000 cases of mackerel were released to the joint market yesterday, of which 60,000 boxes were baby mackerel with just over 21cm. A box of mackerel with a size of 28 cm or more was sold for more than 100,000 won, but the young mackerel was sold for 11000 won per lion, which is one tenth the price. "" As the Korea-Japan Fisheries Agreement broke off starting in July last year, we were unable to cover 70 billion won worth of mackerel picks, which means we could not afford to go to the island. "" Baby mackerel with a length of just 21cm is not worth the market, so it is sold as a fish feed or a bait for tuna. Mackerel on the table must be at least 28cm long. So, many of the Korean mackerel dishes have been reduced to fodder, and the Norwegian mackerel dominates the table. According to the Korea Ocean Fisheries and Fisheries Development Institute on July 13, the catch of Korean mackerel from January to November this year is 68,477 tons, and the import of Norwegian mackerel during the same period is 9607 tons. Considering that half of the mackerel sold in Korea is consumed as fish food, 50 percent of the mackerel served at the table is Norwegian. Experts say, "" If the length of the mackerel can not be caught is raised from the current 21 cm to 28 cm, it can be prevented from overfishing. "" A Korea Fisheries Resource Management Corporation official said, "" The measure of the 21 cm ban on mackerel was considered ineffective in resource management, "" adding, `` Mackerels should have grown almost to 28 centimeters in length after being raised to a young (adult). '' An official at the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry, however, said, "" We have been strongly opposed by fishermen to apply the restriction clause to mackerel that does not have a ban in May last year. The large fishing boats industry is urged to reach an agreement on the Korea-Japan fisheries agreement as soon as possible and allow Chinese vessels to catch up with the 21cm mark. Ma insisted, "" We need to reach an agreement with Japan to allow fishing in Daemado as soon as possible, and stop Chinese fishing boats from catching mackerel or less in Jeju's waters. "" Experts advise that the number of large fishing boats used for catching mackerel should be reduced and that the combination feed should be increased instead of mackerel as fish feed. "" If you replace fish feed with combined feed, you will have no reason for large fishing boats to catch baby mackerel, "" said Dr. Kim Joong-jin of the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute. "" The government is now downing large fishing boats. ▶ lee.eunji2@joongang.co.kr press : Lee Eun Ji, Busan, Korea mobile meet in JoongAng Ilbo [Facebook], cacao, [Plus my friend ] [Mobile web] © 5 Kits combine the (http://joongang.co.kr) and jtbc content hub co, unauthorized war damage and completed additional examination of evidence at court records ... the ban on redistribution of the resolution., ltdProcedure is more than three hours to mid-sized global outlook … deuchoessi anjongbeom former top Shin Dong-bin and Lotte, is also one of the trial, which choesunsil Park said in a petition, to the court president the benefit.We will make in a paddy waggon choesunsil (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) choejaegu reporters are brought on by the constitutional president of the first impeachment gukjjeong nongdan, a key figure in the incident.'nasal glands power' Mr. choesunsil, Seocho-gu, Seoul, Korea 14 days to attend the trial the final trial and is entering the Central District Court. 2017.12.14 jjaeck9@yna.co.kr( : Seoul, Yonhap News Agency) songjinwon ibobae reporters are brought on by the constitutional president of the first impeachment gukjjeong nongdan and Park Geun-hye, the center of this scandal the government.On October 14, is the final procedures of a lower court's ruling known as 'nasal glands power', Mr. choesunsil so sick of trial.

"A 1-percent rise in lending rates will add 25,000 households to high-risk (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency), making the Federal Reserve Board's Federal Reserve Board (Federal Reserve and Federal Reserve Bank) responsible for raising interest rates by 1,000 won (Korean Time) on July 14. The Bank of Korea raised the key interest rate in the first six years and five months of this month, and then joined the U.S. Federal Reserve, which led to the delinquency of household debt with 12 percent of the total household debt. Moreover, concerns are growing over the possible tougher rate in the coming months as the Fed is hinting that it will raise interest rates three times next year.▽ High risk household debt (PG) [Manufacturing Jo Hae-in] Illustrations…The Financial Services Commission announced last month that the interest burden on households at risk increased by 1,400 trillion won and that the savings banks ` overall household debt increased by 100 billion won last month. The increase in household loans has slowed compared to the same period last year, but it is still growing rapidly. The Bank of Korea's quarterly household credit balance announced at the end of September was 119.1 trillion won, up 362.7 trillion won (34.3 percent) from September 2014. In addition, the combined increase in household loans by the financial sector in October and 10.1 trillion won in November will add up to 1.45 trillion won. Amid the mounting household debt, the faster pace of the increase in the domestic loan rate increases the burden on Korean households to repay their principals and interests, which in turn weakens the household's financial soundness, which could lead to a decline in household spending. In particular, if the delinquency rate increases, especially among those at risk households with weak debt payment ability, the household debt problem could accelerate and spread to the actual market.The Bank of Korea analyzed the household's financial welfare survey results in 2016 and found that only 126 percent of households in charge of household debt could face debt deficit. Their financial debt amounts to 186.7 trillion won, or 21.1 percent of their total financial debt. High-risk households with the ability to repay debts despite selling their assets accounted for 315,000 households, or 2.9 percent of all households with debt, and their debt was tallied at 62 trillion won, or 7.0 percent of their total financial debt. High-risk households grew from 297,000 in 2015. ◇ Three interest rate hikes next year … The Fed is likely to accelerate its rise, suggesting that it will raise the key interest rate three times next year. A steep rise in lending rates could increase high-risk households by an exponential rate. According to the central bank analysis, a 1-point rise in lending rates increases the high-risk households by 25,000 households, while a 1.5-point rise in lending rates increases the high-risk households by 60,000. The debt of car owners vulnerable to external shocks surpassed 80 trillion won as of late June, according to the central bank. The figures are based on household debt data obtained from credit reference companies of approximately one million. Weak car refers to a multiple debtor who borrowed from three or more financial institutions and a low-decredit (credit rating 7-10) or low-paid (30 %). The size of the low-capacity loans is 6.1 percent of the total household loans, up 1.9 trillion won from the end of last year. A Financial Supervisory Service official said, "" Since mortgage rates are long-term rates for more than a year, we were more willing to follow the U.S. and other international financial market rates than the Bank of Korea's. "" "" If the U.S. raises the key mortgage rates, it would be against the rate of 4 next year. ""Financial Services Authority Chairman Choi Jong-koo said, "" With the central bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve, the central bank and the central bank plan to provide more vulnerable borrowers with more financial support due to the increase in the key interest rates, and announced plans to revamp overdue interest rates. It also plans to step up monitoring of the household loan market in preparation for an increase in interest rates. According to the package of household debt measures announced by the financial authorities in October, the number of vulnerable households facing a possible decline due to a lack of the ability to repay debts amounted to 320,000, or 2.9 percent of all debt. Their debt amounts to 94 trillion won, or 7 percent of the total. The self-employed, who are not able to repay income and are vulnerable to an increase in interest rates, accounted for 484,000 people, or 30.2 percent of the total, and their debt holdings were tallied at 386.6 trillion won, or 7.4 percent of the total. yulsid@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!) [The Dong-A Ilbo] Health Ministry's payment of the medical equipment, payment of the 700 million won in late 2011, sent a bullet wound to Somali pirates during an operation to pay for the "" The Dawn of Gulf of Aden. "" It has been six years since the controversy over medical treatment costs erupted. A senior health ministry official said on July 13, It is immoral for the government to pay for treatment when what happened at the national level is left to private hospitals, even though it is not morally appropriate to pay for treatment. Now that the captain has received emergency treatment for the bullet wounds, we will receive support from the Emergency Medical Fund.Ajudae Hospital in January 2011 operated and restored the captain who had suffered severe bullet wounds to both legs, wrists and abdomen. After recovering after 10 months, Seok was safely discharged from the hospital in November that year. At the time, captain Seok's medical expenses were 250 million won. Among them, Aju University Hospital had to deal with the deficit without receiving the same amount of money. Samho Shipping, which Captain Seok's management team had to pay for the accident, failed to pay for the treatment due to financial difficulties. Private hospitals can continue to take charge of major patients on behalf of the nation, said an official at the University of Aju Hospital, saying, If the nation keeps the cost of medical care, private hospitals can concentrate on treating patients. Meanwhile, Oh Cheong-seong, 25, who was shot while defecting via the Joint Security Area (JSA), has reportedly spent more than 100 million won on medical treatment. She was taken to hospital in an extremely poor condition and received all kinds of first aid and treatment, including injection of blood from outside of her body (Ekmo) and 12,000 cc of treatment. He also had surgery twice by Lee Kook-jong, a professor of surgery at Azu University Hospital. The cost of treatment rose sharply in a short period of time, as several of the bullet wounds were associated with the disease, including pneumonia, hepatitis B and blood poisoning. Defense Minister Song Young-moo recently asked lawmakers at a general meeting of the National Defense Commission in the National Assembly whether the payment for the soldiers who have defected is to be paid by the Defense Ministry, and told the National Intelligence Service to support North Korean defectors.Lee Jin-han, a medical reporter, doctor likeday@donga.com and doctor Kim Yoon-jong ; official Facebook for The Dong-A Ilbo / The Dong-A Ilbo ; Total collection of hot economic issues and re-teaching methods (click!) ; and no reproduction."
