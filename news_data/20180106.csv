In New York, the first thing you need to do is clear the eyes of fire hydrants so you can easily find them on snowy streets. ▽ Pictures = New York's Seashoe Balloon (FDNY) = On July 4 (local time) = A blizzard with winds of up to 65km per hour hit Manhattan, New York. The donghae ‘monster storm.’ will move north along the coast face a painful sunburn, according to a strong snow and wind was sweeping the city. The temperature dropped to - 13 degrees Celsius, shutting down JFK international airport. The snow drift, measuring 15-25 cm, has turned the downtown and residential roads into a snow field. Around Hanintaun Town, in Manhattan around noon on that day, merchants began to remove snow accumulated on the streets with rain and shovels. It was snowing heavily, but fire hydrants were visible in the city and residential areas. Vehicles are not parked near the hydrant, and merchants removed the snow from the fire hydrant. ○ "" Get your eyes off the fire hydrant "" Twitter 4 (local time) New York Seashoe Bureau (FDNY) posted a message on Twitter account. Tell citizens to ' keep their eyes clear of the fire hydrant for an emergency '. Residents and building managers also removed their eyes from the main streets of Roosevelt Island on the morning of the same day. The fire hydrants here were visible everywhere. Keeps Williams, building manager who was cleaning snow, said on the same day, "" When you put your eyes away, you first put your eyes away. "" "" When the fire hydrant is buried in the snow, people don't know it, and park it around. "" As the New York Seashoe Warning was issued, the residents and merchants of the company responded on Twitter, "" Please keep your eyes closed so that firefighters can see the fire hydrant in an emergency. "" FDNY also complained that spending time finding hydrants and securing water could endanger the lives of not only firefighters but citizens. A civil spirit of consideration for one's neighbors shines at the moment of the fire. According to the local media NY 1, firemen at Rochester, New York, benefited heavily from citizens who had put away their eyes around the fire hydrant by Spencer. `` Luckily somebody cleaned up the area around the fire hydrant, '' said Assistant Director General Bart Joseph Rochester. Some local governments, including Rochester, are disclosing the location of the hydrant to make it easy for citizens to recognize. ○ A hydrant left unattended in the winter will have to set off a third of its annual fires in December, January and February in New York City, where 8.5 million time bombs live. When the temperature falls suddenly, a fire frequently occurs due to overheating of the radiator. In New York City, where buildings are concentrated, fire hydrants play a crucial role in fighting fires. Twelve people died in New York's Bronx apartment fire on December 28 last year. According to the New York Times, firefighters went to the scene after receiving a 911 call in three minutes, but their time was delayed because the fire hydrant froze. We lost the "" Golden Time "" of fire fighting while we were trying to connect fire hoses and find an ice hydrant. Because of this, firefighters are careful about fire hydrant management in the winter. Because it freezes easily when there is a lot of water on the fire hydrant or when snow is covered. However, it is not easy for firefighters to manage every single hydrant. Firefighters in Williamsport, Pennsylvania frequently work outside to manage 800 fire hydrants in the city in the winter. `` If the fire hydrant is not frozen solid, we will have to look for another one, so we are wasting our time, '' said Todd Heckman, director of fire department at the local broadcaster, and asked for people's help. ○ If the 15-foot rule is violated, the first fire hydrant was seen in New York City in 1808 for towing and a $ 115 charge. It is believed to have 110,000 fire hydrants across the city. The car can not be parked within 15 feet to the left and right sides of the hydrant. Color the kerb red to indicate that it is a non-parking area. The 15-foot rule applies even if no red paint is available or deleted. In extreme cases, some drivers carry a tape measure to avoid paying fines and even look directly at the distance from a hydrant when the "" red paint "" has been erased. An exceptional situation is when the driver sits in the driver's seat during the day and can start immediately. They do not even allow it at night. If the rules are violated, the vehicle will be towed and a fine of $ 115 (120,000). New York = correspondent for Park parky@donga.com ▶ Facebook officially meets Dongah Daily Facebook"
"Published on the day of the publishing of the 20th-generation "" Normal Crush "" diplomat's dream of receiving 300 million won in salary at Seoul National University, but was satisfied with the experience of finding a "" satisfied-looking old man "" and "" ordinary people who live happily ever after under the same conditions If you don't have money, fame and power, it's a failure. However, younger generations refuse to have uniform justice. Everyone has his or her own success. Who would dare say that the life of anyone is not a success? "" It was okay to live as a Nobody, "" Ko Young-kwon, a journalist. People seem to believe that it's normal to live more fiercely and go higher, but I'm quite satisfied with my current job as a monthly publisher and editor, who makes my current life as a ' Anyone ', rather than being paid 28. "" Although the annual salary has risen from 24 million won to 30 million won in recent salary negotiations, it is still a small amount compared to college graduates from big businesses and public corporations. Jang, who studied foreign literature at Seoul National University after graduating from a foreign language high school in Seoul, had a dream of becoming a diplomat until he was a sophomore at university. It has been since I was in fifth grade at a elite academy that I saw my middle school student next door writing down diplomatic officials in the sign of my text in hopes of becoming a dream. Admiration for a foreign country, a feeling of exoticism, a social status that parents would be pleased with. Never thought of anything but a diplomat.I'm tired of a rat race. Whether this is true success and happiness, the younger generation congregates. Getty Imagebanna was living a life, but when it was really getting ready, a lot was off the ground. Looking around, everyone was diligent and fierce. He was thorough in his own things. The diplomatic class, in which all of the laptops were turned on and accepted the professor's speech, was more like a news conference than a university lecture. Why is it so hot? How can I be happy to be a diplomat? Question marks swamped the interior like a tsunami. The most fundamental question finally reached : ' Am I able to commit myself to my country at the expense of my personal life?' My head is on end. Then, I think it is right to give up this dream. Chang realized. I did not know what my dream was, so I followed my older sister's dream of an cram school.After I gave up my diplomatic dream, I saw a considerable gap in my career. The wander went on. I went to grad school on my mother's recommendation, but I soon realized that my dream of being a professor was not based on my passion for learning. "" Being a professor looked good because I had more time to myself than I did in public office. I felt pure joy in studying foreign languages, and I vaguely wanted to do something that would help people. Then it doesn't have to be a professor. Then I remembered a publisher. "" And so I was asked a series of skeptical questions about getting a job interview. "" It's too high a salary to go to my publishing company. "" The salary is low and the company is in Paju, and I was wondering if it would be possible to compare it to my friends who live a glamorous life in Seoul. "" If you're going to quit after learning some work, you're going to have to pay dearly for it. "" "" Now that I have been working for only 9 months, I love the job and want to continue in the publishing industry. The possibility of going back to grad school is focused on 0. Most of my friends pass the state exam or go to the big companies, but I haven't been surprised by my being depressed when I compare them. I'm sure they're more successful than me in social terms, but I don't like what I'm doing very much right now, because I don't like the fact that I'm on a monthly salary of 1.85 million won, and Chang Ye-seung is currently a failure as a textbook editor. She believes she has finally found a life that fits her body perfectly. The first reason that Getty's image, Bank Chang, makes her own life a success is rewarding and fun. It is rewarding to edit the text, for example, the translations in men's talks, the ones who use informal language, and the ones that use polite words, are edited to correct their political correctness. There is also a sense of pride in being "" one-party, "" ranging from editor specific tasks such as teaching, proofreading and author management to contents planning and design, and video making. I think securing ‘ my time ’ is the most important condition of happiness and I'm confident that the best choice was to have a current job with a proper worklife balance."" My parents had high hopes for me when I was good at studying and listening to them. I told her I didn't get up enough nerve to work at the publishing company until two days later, and she still regrets it when she'll be able to continue. Let me tell you about the pleasure and joy I felt at work. Now I think my parents are a little convinced. Working a decent time, earning the right money, meeting good people for a free time, and having a good time with them. It's a successful life for me. "" And I'm not really satisfied with my current salary. But Jang says decisively. "" You have to work more to make a lot of money. I don't want to make money out of it. "" At Lee's words, "" Be anyone, "" 2030 roared and went crazy. Success in Korean society was axiomatic. Have all your money, fame and power, or at least one. Being in the top one percent is an undeniable global categorical imperative. What's special is good, what's normal is bad. We can not afford to get a clear view to the ladder of steep success. So a terrible competition to knock over a friend and push his neighbor away is inevitable : Will he ever be happy when he gets to the top of that ladder? I don't know. Did this race of crazy acceleration finally start to brake? Normal Crush, which is enthusiastic about ordinary things with the realization that normal life is the happiest, is emerging as the talk of the younger generation. Youth was not originally about socializing with the average criminal. But the latest strong trend is all about being ' the coolest ' ever. It is no longer limited to fashion, interior, and lifestyle. What is the use of decorating homes with plain clothes, plain rice, and plain candles and teacups? What is the use of living in an unusual way? Last year's trendy Danish coffee shops, Swedish and other Pika were criticized for boosting consumption of candles, coffee, and European interior appliances, but their longing for spending was humble and modest. At Seoul National University's Consumer Studies professor Kim Nan-ro, who has declared himself a "" small but certain happiness "" and has proven itself to be an ever-proven megatrend, is now eager to live. Sojeonhan is a neologist that Japanese novelist Murakami Haruki first used in his essay, "" An Afternoon of a Langelhans Island, "" ripped apart or folded up a freshly baked, small-friendly bread. It is in line with normal crush, not just consumption, but the lifestyle itself."" Be a good man. Be anyone, "" singer Lee Hyo-ri, who cheered and cheered to normal school girls at JTBC last August, confirmed this enthusiastic comment. Water, who would you become when you grow up, told a girl he met while road, criticizing Lee Kyung-kyu, who answered MC Kang Ho-dong's question : Be a good man. The words, which even made elementary school girls laugh, flooded online and social media with reactions such as "" I felt indescribably free "" and "" I'm impressed with good to hear. "" The younger generation has expressed collective consensus on the normal crush of a normal life as ' anyone ' who leads a normal life. Lee Tae-hun and his family, who live in the sky ranch in Daegwanryeong, are incomparably happy when they were earning 300 million won a year. Lee Tae-hun (36), who worked as a manager of a flock and dairy farm in Daegwanryeong and earned 300 million won in income for his work, also worked as an online shopping mall operator. Having started his career as a writer for KBS gag programs and gained a reputation as a documentary writer, he established an advertising company with three friends in 2012 after working as a writer and running a shopping mall. He continued to work, even after the fact, by running two small prop shops selling works by art artists. Although I wanted to become a gag writer and had to work in a documentary, I was eager for my dream and success. It was common to have two or three jobs at once."" I've read somewhere that the amount of money and happiness is no longer directly proportional starts at 4 million won, and it really is. At one point, when a customer comes to the store, I get irritated. It started at 4 million won per month. More than that is not what I need to live on, and I'm struggling to win one more guest to manage to rake it in. It was all futile effort. "" I fell asleep at midnight every day, and I woke up at 6 a.m. When they open their eyes, they first scan the weather with their smartphones, read articles about politics and society on the portal, and then keep their eyes on trends. The average person spends 365 days a year in bed bothering himself and thinking about saying this when he meets someone. "" So many times he had to touch things. I thought everyone had to live like this. But I didn't. It's not until now that I realize that it's okay to live in such a small group of sheep ranch owners. "" False myths were prevalent in Korean society that if you didn't succeed, you were unhappy. It is clear that the society of individual students, in which no one can help or rescue them, will be over once they are driven to the brink. But a room not to be on the edge of a cliff."
"The law is not all about success and success. He said, "" If you don't like it, you will get ahead in the world. "" But that remark will continue to grow stronger. ' Why should I get ahead in life when I feel guilty? I would be happy.There are many people who say that they are quite happy to live as ' anyone. ' "" A philosopher named Rakang said, ' Man desires the desire of a batter. ' The baby smiles at her and likes her, and the baby continues to fall and walk because her family is praising her and happy. As an adult, you have to separate your desires from those of others, but I think there are many people in our society who are unable to do so. And you said, ' Hmm? This is not what I wanted."" Suddenly you realize it. "" Lee Tae-hun, the manager of the sky ranch, feeds the flock on the snow field on July 4. It was natural that Lee, who was thinking about what his life would be like, saw the ranch here. To live life in a competitive-all capitalist society is to choose one of the things that others have made. Then, they think they exercised their free will. I wanted to go back to the source and live in a world of raw materials that nobody could touch. I had to live a life of touching the soil. The current life of raising a 20-month-old baby with his wife as a heavy-growing manager brings Lee an exorbitant amount of money compared to the peak. However, success is a normal life with his family. "" I don't tell my wife and children, ' Let's live like this, ' or ' Let's not regret it. ' "" I want them to live their lives. Not someone else's life, but their own life. "" Having a small startup company and a flexible working day job, Kim says the most important thing in life is not money or success. "" Kim Seo-jin (alias : 29), a graduate of Seoul National University, is a user data analysis and content planning firm in a small startup that develops smartphone apps. He spent two years in Sillim-dong and prepared for the civil service examination, but stopped because of his fierce opposition to the competition. Getting on the track to elite schools is like having a competitive lifestyle in South Korea, but the atmosphere at the public relations school was no longer tolerable when it was said that the nation's high schools had already become the best. As an adult, I felt I would get a job that would have been classified as a vested interest because I studied well when I was a child. It would be an honor to pass in the morning and become an officer. But you have to handle the heavy workload. College friends and high school alumni usually work for large companies and have professional friends such as accountants and doctors. Sometimes when I see the news about how much money a company gave me as a bonus, I think, you know, ○○ is going to make a lot of money. But I don't have any problems with their overtime work, burnout-out, dining cultures, or office politics, so I don't think that's the case with them. I don't envy you. "" Kim now makes a small salary of over 30 million won, works from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. on some days, and from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on others as a flexible working day. There is hardly any overtime. There is, however, not a least possibility of making a fortune at once in startup. There is no way that the company I work for now would not be like Naver or Kakao. But Kim shakes her head. "" I started out because I liked the horizontal and free atmosphere of the company, not because I felt like I could do great when it grew. Of course doing my best and feeling the sense of accomplishment in what I'm being given is important. But I don't want to have to sacrifice my personal life for accomplishment and accomplishment. Society says success is making a lot of money, getting a high position and buying a good house in Seoul. If things work out well, I'd love to. But it's much more important to have a job that fits your values and doesn't suit your tastes as much as you do, "" says one of his friends in the business world, "" and why go to a store like you do? Directors from industry consulting firms advise as if they were concerned, ' Move quickly to bigger, better companies or move to a position where you can get a stake in the company. ' But Kim says, "" You don't have to live so fiercely. "" "" What's the point in trying to force yourself to become a successful person? I'm very satisfied with my life now, when I can enjoy my free time cooking and go to the movies with my mid-wetter, "" Kim said with a perfect score of 10. "" Eight points! I wish I could get a little more pay, so I need to deduct two points. "" (Laughing) I need both money and time. You can not buy one with the other. Choi, who has turned down an offer from an interior company for hundreds of millions of won per year and started a private workshop, believes that "" Celsius is the successful life of earning the right amount of money and spending the right amount of money. "" I'm so happy to live as a Getty image bank!Due to the uniform success formula, the distribution of passion and talent has not been well established in Korean society. Even though students are talented in art, they should go to medical school to succeed, and although they are passionate about writing, they should go to law school first. It is a huge social waste resulting from this issue. The suffering that individuals have gone through while pushing themselves into the wrong system is heading toward the critical point. Everyone has their own success and happiness, and the definition of success and happiness is different from one person to the next. "" These are huge cries that were made at any time, but can no longer be ignored, and they are now normal."" We were extremely tired of competing. Looking at the structural contradictions in our society, many young people say, ' I can't live like that, but I'll leave because I can't change anything wrong. ' It can be seen as a quiet revenge for the younger generation, "" and "" Koo Jeong-woo, a sociology professor at Sungkyunkwan University, says that people who have tried to control themselves and take away from the culture of a competitive society tend to be the ones who control themselves. "" Kim Yong-seop, head of the Sharp Imagination, stresses, "" The formula in itself has changed for the Millenier generation (the early 1980s - early 2000s). "" "" There is a way of life created by the older generation. Going to a good university, having a high-society job, making a lot of money and starting a family has always been a definition of success. The first single person in the history, Generation X, also declined pressure to marry and give birth, but failed to give up money, social status and good jobs. But the Millenier generation accepts that. Even though the older generation is losers, they don't accept it, "" Kim said, "" because they are the children of the Baby Boomers, they don't like it the way they are born, they don't like it at all. If you can not do what you want to do, what does it mean? Choi Eun-seop (alias : 30), who opened a private carpenter's room a year ago while working for an interior company, has no intention of creating a big fight. When I was at work, I was so good that I received an offer of a scout for 100 million won a year, but I was disillusioned by the company's atmosphere of being preoccupied with revenue generation without any interest in design or quality. The company representatives made a brilliant success by moving into a Mansion House, expanding its stores, and purchasing a new foreign car, but did not seem to have any success in Choi's eyes. "" With an interior company, I have nothing to do but fix a built-in closet in my finished building. But I like that I can lead the whole way in a workshop. Since money is not my goal, I have chosen to turn down the offer of several hundred million won a year. I feel to my skin that more and more young people are thinking like me. People who want to set their own standards and do what they like better than the standards of the world are increasing at a rapid pace. Even if you don't have the guts to do it yet, most of you have the desire to do so. "" And he said, "" What is the definition of success? `` You can order chicken to eat as you want to, without any worries. '' It is not meant to join Haetal's Nirvana It is not a time to abandon the world. Just chicken is enough. They ask what they call the "" loser's life "" for the older generation. ' What are you going to do with all that success? So are you happy?Choi said, "" I have a big ambition in fact. "" "" To work five days a week without overtime. No matter how good the fight goes!

The controversy died out as more local governments announced they would conduct tax investigations and declare they would get fair prices.

Intel Semiconductor chips, manufactured over the past decade, have recently been found to have security flaws that enable hackers to easily retrieve personal information due to design issues.Intel said on July 4 that it had developed an upgrade program that would solve the security problems of PCs and servers (large computers) using Intel chip, and is currently in the process of updating them. Most semiconductor chip products produced in the past five years have been secured against security problems, and the company plans to finish updating them by the end of next week to more than 90 percent.Microsoft has released a security upgrade program for Windows since July 3, and Google said it can solve the problem by installing a security upgrade program for smartphones with an Android operating system. Apple announced that it has recently updated its distributed program to prevent security breaches such as the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers.Companies are taking urgent steps, but experts say it will take some time to resolve the problem of Intel chip. There are too many Intel semiconductor chips adopted, and there is no way to force users to make any security updates. Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. said yesterday that they are in talks with Intel to apply security patches.Action is also being introduced for users. PC World, an American IT media company, reported ` Installation of programs monitoring the security status of semiconductor chips ` on the ` Operation System Update ` (▲ Windows) ` and ` Installation of security updates for web browsers such as ▲ and Internet Explorer ` as ` Installation of software ` on its website.As the security defect is reported to be quite serious, users should actively update their PCs and smartphones, the KISA said.[Jojaehee] [Dore.com Direct to Chosun] - Copirits ⓒ Chosun Ilbo & Chosun.com, No Unauthorized Child"
"▽ North Korean authorities banned visa extension and pressured to suspend business, and strengthened its name as Chinese. This is because the deadline for the Chinese government to impose a lockout on North Korean companies in China is imminent on July 9. Sources close to North Korea said yesterday that China is expected to close down its North Korean businesses in the North within 120 days after the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution to impose sanctions on North Korea. The exact number of North Korean restaurants in China is not known, but it is said to be more than 100. As the international sanctions imposed on North Korea following a series of nuclear tests have restricted the export target countries and items, the amount of foreign currency to replace them has soared in recent years. A source close to the border said, "" The North Korean restaurants were once operating in Jilin, Liaoning and Heilongjiang provinces, but the Chinese authorities are likely to freeze their visa to expand their operations. ""A North Korean restaurant in Dandong, Liaoning Province, China [Yonhap news photo] said, "" If the government closes its official document in Liaoning province late last year, it will be dismissed as a "" Korean Town restaurant "" on July 50. Another source said, "" North Korean restaurants are seeking ways to survive despite orders to close. "" "" The North Korean restaurants in China have been prepared to continue operations in another form (since the closing order), "" he said, referring primarily to the use of workers with visa remaining and transfer their names to Chinese employers. Indeed, North Korea, which had previously run restaurants in China as a direct investment, has suffered a setback due to a series of military provocations by China and a series of joint ventures by major South Korean customers. We could see North Korean restaurants lighting up and bidding late at night in the New Year, said an official of the Shenyang Korean Community.Does this disappear? [Yonhap news photo] Sita's North Korean eateress, called "" Korean Town "" in Shenyang, China's Liaoning Province, uses the morning exercise before they open their doors / 70 percent of the latest phone models, and tips on buying and mobile phones. Since the ' Official Aid ' given by mobile service providers was not long after the Terminal Distribution Structure Improvement Act went into effect, it was a condition that they received a discount of 930,000 won in communication costs. How much would a cell phone worth?According to a market price tag on the Cetizen, a market price for smartphones called used market, the average price of the Galaxy S8 is 500,000 to 2,000 won. Within a year of purchasing, the value of Galaxy S8 dropped to 53 percent of its purchase price.Smartphones are the latest gadget to be attractive, but they have a faster replacement cycle and higher depreciation rates than other appliances. The World Daily analyzed on July 5 on the price of the online marketplace, and found that the value of smartphones decreased to 70 percent in three months, to 50-60 percent in one year, and to 10 percent in two years.It also means that purchasing a used smartphone can save a lot of money on household communication. However, the used-phone market is hardly showing any signs of growing. The preference for the latest models and the anxiety about the transaction are pointed out as the main reasons.It is revealed that a year after the value of smartphones is less than 60 percent, and smartphones are 30 percent less valuable if purchased regardless of their type. After a year or so of decline, the slope of the price decline graph begins to slow down.Samsung Electronics ` Galaxy S Series is the best-selling model in the local smartphone market, according to the telecommunications industry. Although prices slightly different according to models, the price of used Galaxy S series dropped to 70 percent three months after its release, to 50 percent a year later, and the price remained in the 20s after two years.For the G7, the price of used goods dropped to 34 percent of the company`s output in eight months. Apple's iPhone price decreased relatively. IPhone also dropped to 70 % three months after its release, but its price has decreased slowly since then.After 26 months since its release, iPhone 6Gb/s still transacts its used phones at 49 percent of its price.The iPhone is responsible for continual upgrades to the OS, compared to the so-called Android operating system (OS), and for after-services, where the cost of the failed product is the same as the new product (AS).The iPhone's owners are longer than Android phones, as the price is higher. According to a 2014 survey conducted by the Information and Communication Policy Institute, the average amount of time spent on Android phones in South Korea was two years and four months, while that of iPhones were two years and four months. Although new mobile phones are burdensome, they are not used to a large extent, and therefore smartphones make up a high proportion of household communication costs. The latest expensive smartphones are priced at more than 1 million won, and Apple's highest-rated iPhone X models are priced at 1.63 million won. If one million won smartphone is purchased every two years, it means that it will cost five million won over 10 years.Despite the strong points of cheap prices, Korea`s smartphone use-based transactions are currently not very brisk. There is no exact market size or statistics. However, according to a 2011 report by the Ministry of Environment, 44.3 percent of unused mobile phones were kept at home and 29.9 percent were exported. Only 8 percent of used mobile phones were recycled domestically.It is presumed that the situation is not much different now. SK Telecom officials said, The percentage of used mobile phones is about 10 percent.However, some companies are trying to revive the second-hand market by selling used smartphones last year. The rate of discount on optional phones, which gives monthly communication discounts instead of receiving an official fee, is also expected to rise from 20 percent to 25 percent since September last year, contributing to the rise in used mobile phone transactions.The government, which has only called for reviving the market of used mobile phones, is set to grasp this year. The Ministry of Science and Technology and Information and Communication is planning to investigate the market status of used mobile phones at a cost of 80 million won this year. It plans to resolve security uncertainties and prepare measures to revitalize the ecosystem, including the transparency of distribution structures.As there is little possibility of leakage of latest smart phone and personal information, reasonable used smartphone transactions can reduce household communication costs. While not uniform, based on the statistics at the used-market, it is only a few months after launch that you can purchase second-hand items such as new ones at a much lower price than the original price. An overly old smartphone may limit its application use, but a smartphone older than a year after its release is not problematic in purchasing it second-hand. Because core OS updates are usually made every year, the same OS as the latest smartphones can be used for about two years after a purchase, and most of the updates afterwards do not run out of function.Contrary to consumer concerns, experts say a little care can be taken in the case of the latest smartphones to prevent the leakage of personal information due to second-hand transactions.If we reset the device several times, we can minimize the leakage of personal information, said Laon Security, senior researcher Lee Jong-ho. An officer in charge of cyber investigations also said, "" With modern smartphones, it is not easy to recover data with multiple initializations. "" Do not delete some files without initializing the device. In this case, information can be leaked. If you are still not relieved, you can sell your smartphone using a reliable second-hand dealer who can erase the device information.In case of a used transaction, it is possible to lose money if an individual can make an agreement. In addition, the status of the products purchased may fall short of expectation. If you are using the online second-hand market, you should see the product in person and purchase the product with an AS period left, so you can easily solve future repair problems.When buying a used mobile phone, first of all, make sure it is a device that can sign up for an optional contract. If one subscribes to the monthly communication fee of 65,000 won as an elective, one will receive a discount that will last up to 400,000 won over two years. However, if the seller has previously been entitled to a publicly disclosed support allowance and has opened the mobile phone, the optional arrangements are not available until the next two years. Rather than buying a used mobile phone with an official subsidy, it would be beneficial to buy a new one and sign up for an elective contract. If you know the ' Terminal International Identification Number ' (IMEIs) of a mobile phone, it is a self-sufficing system on the Internet (https : // device.You can check whether an optional contract is available in Korea).Eom Hyeong-jun, a reporter at ting@segye.com ⑨ Global Media World Daily"
"The entire collection, 60,000 cases, send some 40,000 cases are non-members of the contributions of law public resistance [Associated Press file photo] center spokesman jeonggwangyong (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) hwangjaea the press.= 25 billion won worth of illegal donations to 'impeach president of the Coalition for national resistance chonggwolgi' (National Resistance headquarters, old tangiguk) officials have been handed to trial on charges of illegal funds collected.It was confirmed there are about 40,000 cases of early. That is 67 percent of the total number of donations. Police said Monday that the Seoul Police Agency's elite criminals ' team arrested a group of government prosecutors last year on charges of violating the law on the raising and use of political funds and donations, and named Jeong Gwang-yong (60), a former spokesperson of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, last year. Officials of the U.S. and Japan's state of the art and technology ministries collected 2.5 billion won illegally from November 2016 to May 2016 when the Korean national flag rally was launched, and used the money to pay 600 million won in illegal political funds. Under the donation and donation laws, donations to non-members with more than one billion won in annual amounts should be registered with the Ministry of Public Administration and Security, but Chung and others collected donations without registering to raise funds. Police, investigating the circumstances of illegal fundraising, received a financial account tracking warrant to check the size of the donations and the details of the accounts Chung and others used. Police also identified the names of 20,000 people who sent the money and the addresses of those who received the funds to determine the amount of money that the members of the National Resistance Headquarters and the Department of the Air Force raised. According to the investigation results, 3.39 billion won out of the total collection was determined to have been paid by the members, and the police reported the incident to prosecutors as an illegal payment amount excluding this part. In addition, nearly 60,000 donation transfers were carried out, and 40,000 of these transfers were made by non-members, or 67 percent of them. jaeh@yna.co.kr"
"The first time the government would ever put MSG in its diet, the first time it's possible to eat that food, the first time it's possible for the condiment to be consumed, the first time this year it's safe to eat that. It is doubtful that a spoonful of beef should be added to make the most of the same flavor. The white powder, which was self-appointed as the origin of the taste, penetrated the food like a snake and woke people's tongues. Sodium L-Glutamate, or MSG. One day, MSG was slowly taken off the table. MSG, which was considered a trademark of chemical seasoning as nature and nature became a symbol of good health, became a powder that should be avoided, ruining my body. It took no MSG to make it a ' good ' food. Japanese advertisement for MSG, Ajinomoto [Photo : Institute of Modern History] MSG has been de-famored in 20 years. From this year, the KFDA changed the official label of MSG to a flavor enhancer, not a "" chemical compound. "" That means they want to eliminate unnecessary misunderstanding by separating the additive from the mixture. What happened to MSG? MSG is born in Japan. In 1908, chemist Kikunae Ikeda wondered how kelp stop making the soup taste good. After studying, they found that the ' glutamic acid ' component in kelp is the key. It was not enough to take the ingredient out of kelp and put it in food. The research was successful in extracting the teeth from wheat. MSG is made by combining glutamic acid with sodium that is easily soluble in water. The current MSG makes cane molasses fermented and produced in large quantities. Daishin's Pandema, launched after Miwon, the first MSG in Korea. [Photo Institute of Contemporary Art] Ikeda called its amazing taste of MSG "" umamI. "" It is not sweet and salty, but rather sour and bitter, taste 5. Named Ajinomoto the following year, the sauce was spread throughout the world and also to Korea, which was a colony of those days. Companies that sell the product are also named Ajinomoto. Ajinomoto, who models Choi Seung-hee, the best dancer at the time, also uses Wang Ga, said he is eager to promote himself. The restaurant serves naengmyeon and Korean stock dishes free of charge to Pyongyang's restaurants, and is also a regular place to make a dish. Those who could not forget the taste even after liberation ate MSG that was smuggled from Japan. When the breeze gave her a sweater as a gift in 1970, Miwon set fire to it by promising to give her a pure gold ring. In Korea, Dong-A Hwasung Industrial Company, the current target group, introduced Miwon, the first MSG in 1956. As rumors about the popularity of the dish spread, the company distributed samples of what was called "" Today's Housewife Practice "" to female high school seniors when they became a major consumers. In 63, Jedang held a "" breeze "" and created fierce competition. The two companies even stopped competing with each other, saying, "" If I bring five bags I can get a pure gold ring and sweater. "" The controversy over MSG started around this time. It began when a Chinese American doctor told an American journal that after eating food with MSG, he developed paralysis in the back of his neck and dizziness. It even got its name, "" Chinese Restaurant Syndrome, "" saying it shows up after eating Chinese food. Amid the controversy, the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization imposed a daily limit of 120 milligrams per kilogram or less in recognition of MSG that could harm people. MSG is now overturned. That is because follow-up studies failed to prove MSG is harmful. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on two occasions, "" There is no evidence or justification that MSG is harming the human body at the current level of use. "" The International Food Additives Commission (JECFA) of the World Health Organization and FAO announced that MSG is safe. It is less toxic and has a very small intake, "" removing the daily limit of intake. An advertisement for instant noodles highlighting MSG in 1996. [Central Photo], however, has become more controversial here. In 1993, a large food company produced a seasoning for him. With the phrase of "" I haven't put MSG in my chemical, "" he advertised MSG as a possible damage to brain cells or cause asthma. The government ordered that the ads were wrong, but consumer distrust of MSG had already grown. Companies later stirred up the distrust by telling their products did not put MSG in them. As the controversy continued, the government stepped forward. In 2010, the Food and Drug Administration announced its official stance that MSG is safe for life. In 2013, some studies have shown that using MSG with salt can reduce overall sodium consumption by 20 to 40 percent. Salt contains about 40 percent sodium, but MSG is 12 percent, which makes it advantageous for low-salt diets. While research is underway on the function of MSG, the International Research Organization for Amino Acid and Science (ICAAS) announced last year that MSG protects the mucous membrane from stomach damage caused by helicobacter pylori. A 1993 condiment advertising Since then, the MSG controversy has become violent here. Even in academia, MSG is safe. Oh Sang-seok, a food science professor at Ewha Womans University, says the FDA makes ` reasonable assurance that no harm ` a standard, explaining, `` On this basis MSG is safe. '' There is no firm ground for MSG if it is dangerous, in view of known scientific facts. That is not to say that it is okay to bolt and eat. Professor Lee Deok-hwan of Sogang University's chemistry department said, It does not mean it is safe to eat infinitely, adding, Just as with most foods, sugar, starch and others, eating an excess of the right amount would only make you sick. When combined with what experts say, it is not necessary to stay away from experts because it is harmful. It may take time before consumer perceptions change. According to a 2013 Food and Drug Administration survey, Koreans cited food additives (34.5 percent) as the most frequent source of food when asked what factors posed as a threat to consumers ' food safety. In other words, it is more dangerous than environmental hormones (26.4 percent) and harmful microbes (12.2 percent). The government does not need to encourage people to make any choice, but many say it should reduce unnecessary anxiety caused by false information. Even Gangnahyeon journalist, kang.nahyun@joongang.co.kr [S BOX], a 300 times higher than sugar, the controversy over the chemical MSG of cancer substances looks like another food additive. Saccharin, known as a carcinogen, was shunned for more than 40 years before it was released from the face of the earth recently. Saccharin was discovered accidentally in a laboratory at a university in the United States in 1879. It is 300 times sweeter than sugar but has no calories so it has become popular instead of sugar. In 1977, Canada's National Institute of Health began preventing mice from being used, saying, "" I developed a tumor in my bladder when I injected Saccharin into them. "" Korea imposed a ban on most foods starting in 1990, preventing them from being used in 92. As the hazmat harmfulness of Saccharin was not proven, the International Cancer Institute (IARC) excluded Saccharin from its classification as carcinogens. The Food and Drug Administration also cancelled its use of Saccharin in 2001. As the permitted limit has been extended gradually in Korea, last year, the Ministry of Food and Drug Administration allowed people to use Saccharin for rice cakes and mayonnaise as well. This means that the government has extended the scope of allowing Saccharin to be used in most foods from the previous 29 to 35 items. As the calorie and blood sugar index is zero, people who are overweight or obese are in the spotlight these days as alternatives to sugar. Korean and foreign studies have shown an anticancer effect in which only cancer cells are selectively attacked. ▶ Central Daily [Facebook] [Kakao Plus Friend] [Mobile web] and JTBC Content Hub Co., Ltd.

"The story of a 16-year-old boy and a 71 year old woman who have become married after overcoming a 50-year-old gap is making headlines.According to the Asahi Shimbun on July 6, the two villagers celebrated the wedding in Karan, a rural town on the southern island of the Indonesian island of Smarthar, in which about 300 people got married.Wedding ceremony. About 300 residents gathered to celebrate the two.Their relationship began when the parents of Slamet County moved near Mr. Rohayah's house.Mr. Slammet's father died in an accident not long after he was born. Then a mother remarried and abandoned him.Left alone at a young age, he was adopted by the residents of the village and has a new family.But he said, "" I was always lonely because I thought I was not loved by anyone. ""Meanwhile, the woman left her husband first in two marriages. He gave up on remarriage and lived with his son in the pessimism of being with whom he was treated.The two became friends with Mr. Rohayah's son and became intimate.Mr. Slammet frequented the Rohayas and kept them close. In the spring of 2016, however, she took good care of her husband, who was suffering from malaria.They pledged to marry, I don`t think they would miss each other very much, but I will endure it, although I don`t think they will have to spend too much time together as day laborers.The marrying age set by Indonesian law is 19 for men and 16 for women.Their marriage may be a legal challenge, but the villagers were more respectful of their decisions than the law and wanted them to be happy.Rohayah's son decided not to call the Slameth, but to be friends.Lee Dong-jun, a reporter at blondie@segye.com captured by Asahi Shimbun : "" The first weekend of the World Daily News, Global Media World, "" is clear and the cold is over.But next week, a very strong cold is forecast.Let's take a look at the detailed weather forecast with Yoo Da-hyeon of the Science and Disaster Team.Hello.Let's start with the weather today. Don't you have any big cold today?[Castor] I think this is the winter weather.It's usually six degrees below zero in Seoul this time of year. The temperature in Seoul this morning was - 6.8 degrees Celsius, which is similar to what it was at this time.In the mountainous region of Gangwon, where a cold snap warning has been issued, Cheorwon went down to minus 14.9 degrees.Other Daejeon was - 4.8 degrees Celsius and Daegu - 1.5 degrees Celsius, respectively, which was cold in most regions.The daytime temperatures in Seoul will be around 2 degrees Celsius, Daejeon 5 degrees Celsius, Daegu, Gwangju 7 degrees, and Busan 9 degrees Celsius, which is not too cold.I like the look on my face.Today, we can see clear skies all over the country. Air quality is good because it is "" normal "" throughout the country.However, as the air quality is temporarily suspended in the morning, the concentration of fine dust can increase in Gyeonggi-do, Gangwon Province and North Chungcheong Province.The air is becoming parched with clear weather every day.Let's take a look at where we have a drought warning.There are construction advisories in Seoul, parts of Gyeonggi-do and Jeonnam.Especially, the eastern regions such as Youngdong and Yeongnam Jibang are very dry.A drought warning is the East Sea coast, Gangwon-do, Korea, as fire prevention, care to prevent fire you.[Anchor] It's originally winter when there's less rain, but we have a lot of wildfires this winter. Why did you do that?[Castor] Because the temperature falls dramatically in winter and becomes dry, fire is more likely than other seasons.In December, there were a total of 50 forest fires nationwide, 3.5 times more than the 10-year average of 14.In particular, 38 of the 50 cases were concentrated in Youngnam province.Extremely dry weather is the main cause of the winter forest fire.Whenever the air is cold here in the south, rather strong winds are blowing in, making the forest fire a good place to start.So once it's on fire, it's hard to evolve.Most forest fires are caused by human error.Officials with the Forest Service say less than one percent of forest fires are likely to ignite spontaneously.To avoid winter wildfires, avoid using firearms near forests and smoking in the mountains is very dangerous, so you should never smoke. When you enter a mountain, you don't carry a cigarette or a lighter.In addition, we need to pay special attention to the fire of ash when using the boiler, which is the main cause of the forest fire, completely shut down and expel the fire source.ANCHANT : Let's learn about the weather this holiday. How's the weather tomorrow?[Castor] First, it won't be too cold tomorrow.I don't worry about a cold snap as the temperature is at this time of day at minus 5 degrees Celsius in Seoul tomorrow morning and four degrees Celsius in the daytime.However, it will become cloudy gradually and begin to rain tomorrow afternoon on the southern part of the country.The rain will expand nationwide into snow and rain on Monday.It is expected to snow mostly in the central regions of Seoul, where the temperature is low.The amount of snow now is estimated to be one to three centimeters in Seoul, Youngseo, and northern Chungcheong provinces.So, I think you should prepare your eyes for Monday's commute.[Anchor] After the snow, a strong cold snap comes in?[Castor] After snow or rain, Monday, a strong cold snap will come under 10 degrees below zero.Let's take a look at the temperature forecast for next week first.After the snow stopped, the temperature went down gradually from Tuesday.On Thursday and Friday, the morning temperature in Seoul falls to minus 12 degrees.It was OOO this morning in Seoul. It was cold in the morning, but it's going to be five degrees below that.It looks like it's going to be the coldest time this winter.We will also blow the wind to cool down the feeling.As the temperature falls rapidly, you are more likely to catch a cold.Please take good care of your body temperature to keep your immune system.Anchor : So far, I have checked the weather forecast with Yoo Da-hyeon of the Science Disaster Team."
"CEO of Moon Eun-sang (Yonhap News Agency) Kwon Soo-hyun and Kim Jan-di, a reporter at the third place in the market capitalization of KOSDAQ market capitalization, was involved in a dispute between the CEO of Moon Eun-sang and his relatives. The company's explanation that it sold its shares to pay taxes has not dampened its suspicion. Immediately after the cancellation of the second round of talks, investors raised suspicions over the sale of shares of the largest shareholders, including suspension of clinical tests. Shinrazen announced after closing business on July 4 and announced that the total number of shareholders including Moon and other special officials decreased from 21.5 to 20.53 percent through selling shares. Moon sold 182,249 shares (2.75 percent) in total. Among them, the CEO sold his stocks directly, except for the selling of shareholders who have allowed Moon to vote for them, for a total of 612,884 shares, totaling 103.3 billion won. Among the captain`s eight special members, Moon Sang-hoon, Im Soo-jeong, Cho Kyung-rae and Kwak Byung-hak, who sold their shares, are related relatives. The problem is that the stock price of Shinrasen plummeted as rumors about the sale of the largest shareholder's shares spread before the market went public. Some stock communities have been rumored to be selling shares of the largest shareholder of Shinrazen since the beginning of this year. Some raised suspicions that the new drug candidate for the cancer virus, developed by Silla Zen, failed to apply for an overseas patent, prompting the largest shareholder to sell their shares. Due to this effect, the stock price of Shinrazen plummeted more than 10 percent on July 4. As the market closed more and more, the volume of shares sold in the market more than doubled to 296,000 shares. The stock market was further questioned when major shareholders, including the largest shareholders ' families, sold their shares en masse immediately after the stock market crash. When the stock price dropped more than 7 percent at the beginning of the market on the next day, the company posted a statement on its homepage and began evolving. The disposition of shares is necessary to pay taxes and pay off debts of Moon Eun-sang, Shinrazen said in an admission letter. He then added that the rumors on the Internet that (Pexabek) was discontinued due to patent failures were completely groundless and would "" respond strongly to the ongoing rumors "" regarding the clinical trial. Due to explanation from company and introduction of foreign buying, Shinrazen shares closed 8.46 % higher on July 5. Moon Eun-sang, the chairman of the state-run Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said, The sale is just for paying taxes and paying off debts, with no negative effects whatsoever. In Yonhap news and telephone conversations, Moon said, We have an astronomical tax of about 100 billion won on income that has not yet been paid, however, tax dodgers could not have explained by their differences. `` If they sold the company because it has negative consequences besides taxes, then they are subject to investigation themselves. The clinic is progressing smoothly, and the attention of large pharmaceutical companies is keen. However, investors remain anxious at home and abroad. Critics say that major shareholders, including Moon Eun-sang, sold their shares last month after the end of the protection-service period. Major shareholders usually use the overtime method of mass trading (block deal) to reduce the impact on stock prices in the event of massive selling. Questions are also rising over the value of Shinrazen's company. Shinrazen, listed in December 2016, has seen its stock price soar more than 9 times over the past year due to expectations of developing a new drug candidate using the virus. Since there are limits to measuring the value of new medicines under development and the financial condition is not good, securities firms do not publish an analysis report that shows the performance of Shinrazen. A research center director at a securities firm who declined to be identified, said, Now that Shinrazen has no basis for judgment on the high price of parity or underestimation with its annual profit ratio.

There was a lot of speculation about what kind of high-tech weapons were coming in. I was expecting to start the project to introduce the ultra-precision reconnaissance plane Joint Stars, but we have a fleet that is fast.It is the Navy's next antisubmarine patrol to catch North Korea's submarines. But I doubt the U.S. patrol aircraft can be brought in. Because I decided to choose a competitive bidding system rather than a private contract. It is expected that Poseidon (P-82A) of Boeing of the United States and Swordfish MPA of Sweden will face off against each other.● The KIDA "" Take Competitive Bidding "" … the Office of Defense and Security, "" Buy Overseas, Buy "" has opened its Policy Planning and Acquisition Committee on July 28. Committee to determine the basic strategy of arms business. The Policy Planning Subcommittee has decided to purchase overseas the basic strategy of the next antisubmarine patrol aircraft project. It's not developed locally, but it's buying foreign models.Earlier, KIDA was commissioned by the military to conduct a preliminary study on the method of introducing antisubmarine patrol aircraft. The result is "" Do not use private contracts and introduce them with competitive bidding. "" Accordingly, the next anti-submarine patrol aircraft project is carried out with a competitive bidding process for foreign models. Competitive bidding reduces prices and enables the transfer of technologies or export of Korean weapons in a negotiated manner.Poseidon, a U.S. antisubmarine patrol plane, would be reasonable to bring in cheap patrol aircraft from competitive bidding unless they made a promise to introduce Poseidon to the United States. The competitive bidding process is compatible with the government's mentality of making procedures appropriate.The agency will hold a defense project promotion committee in the first half to coordinate its schedule. Business announcements will be turned off by this summer, and the U.S. and Sweden will have to compete with each other on patrol aircraft. We are planning to bring in six antisubmarine patrol aircraft, but the final aircraft will be decided by the end of the year.● Poseidon vs. Sorpish has already voted in for Boeing and Saab at the Seoul International Airport in October last year. Poseidon in Boeing is, in deed, regarded as the world's best antisubmarine patrol aircraft. MultI-purpose aircraft carrying out antisubmarine warfare, naval warfare, information, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. Boeing says, "" a proven patrol aircraft optimized for navigating from the sea to the desert and performing a variety of short-term and short-run missions.

The United States president 100 % of the door, referred to support inter-Korean dialogue, such as Tuesday to reach a very positive remarks reported to have.Cheong Wa Dae also said the two leaders agreed not to hold any joint military drills during the Pyeongchang Games, and that the two sides agreed to do their best to ensure the safety of the Games.In the meantime, the White House announcement, without the word inter-Korean dialogue or an expression of welcome to it, agreed to continue pressuring at its maximum without repeating past mistakes. We also agreed not to have the Olympics and military drills overlap to ensure the security of the games, the presidential office said in a nuances that is somewhat lower than Cheong Wa Dae.The other senior presidential aide told reporters the other day (July 5) that the two leaders had not faithfully stated the idea of "" not repeating past, "" and "" that the sanctions are not to be put into effect. """" I've written a briefing based on the remarks made by the two leaders, "" Cheong Wa Dae official said. "" So I sent a briefing to the White House on the whole purpose of the call between the two leaders (we). ""Cho 11757 @.Report to the Korea News Agency! [Untrusted reproduction and redistribution by news 1 Korea] First time of over 50 million people who received more than 100 million won in damages ... More than 10 million won last year's increase in gifts by more than 200 million people. In particular, the number of "" gold spoons "" by teenagers who received gifts worth more than 100 million won increased by more than 30 percent, driving the overall increase.According to the National Tax Service's National Tax Service's National Tax Service's National Tax Service's National Tax Service's (NTS) (CG) report on Tuesday that the gift tax rate of more than 100 million won increased to 45,500,000 in 2016. By the account of the amount of donation, 30,145 people earned less than 100 million won and 14,898 people earned less than 300 million won. Over 1 billion won in certificates was 4,242 people, and 412 people donated more than 5 billion won. When it comes to the age of 100 million won or more, those in their 40s topped the list with 14,844, followed by those in their 50s (10,890) and those in their thirties (761). When looking at the year-on-year growth, teenagers saw the biggest increase of 31 percent, from 1,833 to 1,418. People in their 40s (25 %) and 20s (23 %) also increased by more than the overall average of 21 %. The number of children under the age of 10 who received more than 100 million won in gifts was 715. The figure is an increase of 11 percent from the previous year (642). The rapid increase in the number of teenagers who receive expensive gifts is closely linked to a tax reduction strategy to reduce inheritance and gift taxes by handing over wealth before asset values grow. In this vein, children with large holdings are seen most frequently by the heads of conglomerates. The fact that the average per capita dividend income of a minor, gold spoon and spoon, is higher than that of an adult, is also related to the early donation. According to Kim Doo-kwan of the National Assembly's Planning and Finance Committee, the average dividend income of the fishermen during 2013-2015 was 303,197, with the average dividend income of 19.45 million won. On the other hand, the average number of minors who reported dividend income during the same period stood at 1,693, whose per capita income amounted to 127.4 million won. rock@yna.co.krNHK reported on the same day that an earthquake measuring 4.8 hit Tokyo and Kanagawa Prefecture in Japan at 0:54 a.m. The quake was reported to have caused the quake to hit all parts of Tokyo, as well as Kanagawa, Yokohama, Ibaraki, Saitama, Gunma, and Shizuoka Prefecture. The Japanese Meteorological Agency said the earthquake is about 80 kilometers deep. No injuries have been reported due to the earthquake, and no tsunami has occurred.

"Near Earth's closest approach to the Earth on the middle of November : An asteroid called the Skull Asteroid will return to Earth in 2018, three years after it takes to look like a passing skeleton. The asteroid is also called the Halloween asteroid, which came close to Earth around October, 2015. The asteroid, officially designated as ‘ 2015TB 145 ’, was approximately 640m in diameter and reached 480,000 kilometers from Earth on October 31, 2015. It is a little farther than the Moon, which averages 386,600 kilometers.　Astronomers concluded that the asteroid rotates every 2.94 hours and reflects only 5 to 6 percent of the sunlight. Professor Pablo Santos - San Francisco, an astrophysicist at the Andalusia Institute for Astrophysics and Astrophysics, who published a paper in the Journal of Astronology in February last year, said, "" It is darker than that of charcoal's. "" When turning around, an asteroid is skeletal under certain lighting conditions.Scientists say the asteroid's cycle of solar revolution is 3.04 (Nov. 1112). The asteroid will then approach the Earth the closest distance again in mid-November 2018. However, it is expected that the plane will not make as close to the Earth as last time. Because orbit of revolution is tilted, the distance through the Earth each time is different. Never in the next 500 years will it pass as close to 2015, and this time it will move out of the Earth from a distance equal to 105 times the Earth's distance. It is now 3.7 times the distance of the earth and the sun. Scientists explained that the first asteroid was discovered in 2015 because it was mostly located beyond Mars and was very small in size.　The asteroid is practically a dead comet who has lost water and other volatile matter while orbiting the Sun, the researchers said. `` The flight is not very good conditions, but I do think we could get some new data on these asteroids approaching the Earth, '' Dr. Santos said. An asteroid and a comet have different characteristics, including their composition and type of orbit around the sun. While asteroids are mostly made up of rocks and metal, comets have a relatively high proportion of the ice and rock. However, the boundaries are not very clear.Another scientist predicted that the approach time after this year is around Halloween Day in 2088. It is estimated to be close to 20 times the Earth's distance. The skeleton, which appeared in 2015, is the closest asteroid in size since 2006. Scientists predict the next closest pass would be ' 1999 AN10 ' to be made on August 7, 2027. 　The most notable near-earth asteroid is the 99942 Apophis asteroid, which will appear two years later. It is expected to reach 36,000 kilometers point on or around April 13, 2029, one tenth of the distance between the Earth and the moon. When it was discovered in December 2004, the probability of a collision on the earth was estimated to reach 2.7 percent, but with the orbit of orbit confirmed, it is considered unlikely that it would occur. However, the orbit of the Earth can be modified due to the effects of the collision with space debris or other asteroids and the gravitational pull of nearby heavenly bodies on the way to Earth. 　 The near-earth asteroids have both the danger of catastrophic impact on the Earth in the event of a collision and the future wealth of mineral resources. But for now, I would say that the significance of being a threat is greater. As a result, the world's astronomy system is tracking asteroids that are close to Earth. The International Astronomical Union announced in its first Asteroids Day, June 30, 2015, that it is expected to "" detect and track nearly 100 million asteroids over the next decade. "" Asteroids Day was designated to commemorate the "" Tunguska Great Burst with Humanity, "" the largest asteroid impact incident of the 20th century. Experts estimated that an asteroid with a diameter of 40 meters exploded in the upper atmosphere of the Earth.http://plug.hani.co.kr/futures shortcut of senior reporter nopil@hani.co.kr ▶ gwangnopil gwangnopil miraechang tonghapa and the opposition, Frontline secure 20 ‘The UNDP reform’ the other side ready group.18 named and negotiation group comprised with confidence cheolsugye chuldang, and requests the proportional representation “… The opposition would go with, including Kim Sung-sik, just 10” down 安 to integration.Uidang-myeon against the integration with national party Let's go, "" a hard line positions with lawmakers 'The election campaign to protect by right.', a group of lawmakers on July 5 in its first formal meeting.Open.

"Anchors : These days, there are many apartments or multiplex housing with locks on the front door on the first floor. But not a few places write down their passwords next to the front door. I was interviewed by a reporter, Seok Min-hyuk. A woman pulls out of the luggage compartment, and a man follows, writing things down on his cell phone. It was a woman's home address book, and the man's cell phone contained passwords for 51 community doorframes in multiplex housing.I've been around multiplex housing, including studio apartments in Seoul, and I've noticed that 8 out of 30 apartments have passwords on their front porch.

Nam Jae-joon ibyeonggi, three former intelligence chiefs, including ibyeongho Management Body had received 36 million won for the Special Programs from using part of it for personal use.Over the past four days and to additional charges.Shin Ji-won [jiwonsh@ytn.co.kr] Here is a brief summary. Apple has included an update to link battery to smartphone performance, starting with its operating system, iOS version 10.2.1, without alerting consumers. Smartphones usually always need the amount of power designed at the factory. On the other hand, smartphone batteries gradually lose their performance as they are used for a longer time. After using smartphones for several years, the device suddenly turns off due to poor battery performance.A device that goes off easily in the cold winter months with 10 to 30 percent of its battery life remaining and 50 percent to the extreme, can damage the device. Apple explained that to prevent this, it has updated its battery condition to limit the iPhone's performance.It may seem reasonable in some ways, but it is frustrating for the average consumer, who has not received notice in advance that the device they are using will degrade. A little awry, you might say, "" Well, you're going to use a good product and then you're going to buy a new battery with a strong battery. "" That's what iPhone battery gates meant. In fact, the U.S. has already begun a class action to compensate more than 1000 trillion won in damages. U.S. iPhone user Violetta Milian filed a class action against Apple on July 27 in a federal court in California for damages of 999.9 billion dollars. `` Apple encouraged consumers to buy new products without having to repair (replace the battery) the existing ones, '' he says. Apple's market capitalization has dropped to 888.3 billion dollars as of December 4, after its battery gates broke loose, from 905.8 billion dollars on December 18 last year. Korean users are also preparing for class action lawsuits against Apple.Apple has not released the exact performance degradation of the update. The reporter then used the benchmark application to measure the relative performance impact. Benchmark is the work of calculating the operational performance of electronic devices such as computers and smartphones. First, three months ago, he installed the benchmark Antutu Benchmark 6.3.3 on the iPhone 6Gb/s + of a battery swap. ▲ Left is the screenshot of the Battery app, which measures the capacity of the iPhone battery. The capacity of the battery in the factory shipment state is 2750 mA, of which the current usable capacity is 2300 mA. ⑨ Kim Dong-hwan Antutu measures the performance of a smartphone by dividing it into four areas : 3D,UX, CPU, and RAM, and averages it by adding it all 1:1. The figure on the right is the Apple device's benchmark ranking, provided by iOS app Antutu. When measuring the iPhone 6Gb/s + in factory shipments, the results are 132930 points. The reporter measured and compared benchmark scores of the same device when it was buffered and just before it was nearly exhausted. As if the battery charge is too low, it could turn off prematurely, so it is recommended to compare the two cases, 100 % with 10 % with the remaining battery. ▲ Left side is 100 % battery performance. Right side is battery 10 % performance. ⑨ As shown in the figure above, when measured by Ahn Tutu (Antutu) 6.3, an iPhone 6 s + with 10 % battery condition shows approximately 65.4 % performance compared to a buffer state. In other words, the performance is significantly reduced, not by 10 to 20 percent but by more than 30 percent. Specific figures indicate thatUX and CPU-related performance are heavily affected by battery conditions. Megaloderm Compared to Antutu's ranking, the iPhone 6Gb/s + becomes the iPhone 6 +. Of course, this is a limited, limited comparison. In fact, Apple's concern for battery optimization has continued with the birth of the iPhone. It is because the iPhone has maintained its all-in-one battery policy since its early model. In iOS 9, it even offered users the option to reduce smartphone performance and increase usage time.What is interesting is that the performance of smartphones running in low power mode is similar to that of smartphones with Antutu apps. In the case of reporters, the reading was about 86457 points in the 100 % charged and low-power mode. This is similar to the normal power mode benchmark scores of the same device, which is charged by about 15 %. On the other hand, when the remaining battery volume is lower than 20 %, the difference in low power mode and normal mode was minimal. In addition, it is hard to expect a big effect when you turn on the low-power mode with 10 to 20 percent of your battery remaining. Already operating in a low-power mode, Apple said on July 18 that it would "" explain to users what kind of performance their device is in, "" adding that it would be able to better understand what it was doing with iOS updates that were earlier in 2018. I hope Apple's new update is intended to give the user control over performance. As it turns out, most users will not like the manufacturers ' further input.

Seokyeong Cube 2018.01.05. mania@newsis.com As the South Korea-Japan chief delegates ' talks on North Korea, China, and Japan discuss the issue of the six-party talks on North Korea and North Korea are being discussed on Friday, the two Koreas ' Senior Representative Consultative Points for North Korea and the U.S. delegation on North Korea and North Korea and North Korea will be opened on North Korea's nuclear issue ··· With the Korean Peninsula in a turning point, many countries are closely watching how it will affect the peninsula, and are reportedly beating their calculators rapidly. In particular, it is the latest decision by the chief delegates to the six-party talks between China and Japan not to discuss ways to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue through bilateral talks between Korea, China, and Japan. First, Kong Shuan, China's vice foreign minister and special representative for Korean Peninsula Affairs, visited Korea on July 5 and had bilateral talks with Lee Do-hun, the director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Korean Peninsula Peace. They focused on strengthening strategic communication between the two countries on the North Korean nuclear issue during the talks. After the announcement of the New Year message of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, he evaluated the situation on the Korean Peninsula and exchanged in-depth opinions on how to respond to it in the future. The top negotiators from South Korea and China, among others, have reaffirmed their commitment to work together on the Korean Peninsula, sharing their assessment that the situation on the North Korean nuclear issue is rapidly changing. Lee Do-hoon, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Kongshuanyu at the Foreign Ministry in Seoul yesterday afternoon that North Korea`s nuclear standoff is at a crucial turning point, adding, We have seen a major improvement in our relationship with North Korea over the past few years. The director as ""North Korea has been helping the 9th for the authorities we proposed talks today."" and "" Pyeongchang Olympics Olympics to make peace in his New Year`s message, our president.It is a peaceful resolution of the inter-Korean peace building and the North Korean nuclear issue, of course, so you can link and tried my best to cooperate with the international community, stressed. "" I have contacted the Korean side about the new situation, "" said Gong Shian-yu, the Assistant Secretary of State, adding, "" This time I have come to meet with the Korean government and to fulfill the complicated agreement between the two leaders of the Korean Peninsula. "" "" We can continue to improve our relationship by strengthening our strategic communication, by boosting our strategic mutual trust, and by strengthening our communication and sharing efforts on the Korean Peninsula. "" On the day after his visit to Korea, Deputy Foreign Minister Kong Shuanyu will hold a meeting with South Korean Foreign Minister Lim Seong-nam to exchange opinions on the situation on the Korean Peninsula. On July 8, Asian representative for Asian and Asian Affairs Kenji Kanasugi, the chief nuclear negotiator for the six-party talks, will visit Seoul to share an evaluation of the situation on the Korean Peninsula with Lee. The government will deal with the United States and North Korea in a comprehensive manner based on consensus reached during a series of meetings with China and Japan. The U.S. State Department's special envoy to North Korea Joseph Yun is in the process of arranging a meeting. It is analyzed that the interest in the latest inter-Korean dialogue is largely attributable to the brisk consultations between the chief negotiators of the six-party talks, South Korea, the U.S., Japan and China. They say that the related negotiation channels are in full swing to share the situation where dialogue with North Korea is actually happening and to set the direction for the future resolution of North Korea from each country's perspective. The South Korean diplomatic authorities, which have shown little influence over North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations but did not exercise any influence over the international community and the cooperation of North Korea, have put their efforts into this process. kyustar@newsis.com> [Anchors] It is widely known that sugary foods cause adult diseases.

"· A real model of the Yeongdeungpo Prison Security Manager Ahn Jong-cheol and Han Jae-dong (right), the former chief of security at Yeongdeungpo Prison, shared on the 4th floor of Yongsan Prison in a movie titled, Park Jong-cheol. Park Jong-cheol died on January 14, 1987 while being tortured by water, in the place where he lost his position to the head of the National Security Agency. Kim Young-min, a reporter at viola @ngghyang.com, died on January 14, 1987 when Seoul National University student Park Jong-cheol (then 21, Department of Language and Communication) died in the loss of the National Security Headquarters in Namyeong-dong, Seoul. The next day, police announced that they had `` bang '' on the table and `` plunderer ''. Police, who wanted to disguise themselves as "" shock death, "" reduced, manipulated, and concealed the incident when it was revealed that they had been tortured by water. The government has even held a meeting to discuss countermeasures for related agencies and tried to cover up and manipulate them. But it was not long before the truth was revealed and acted as a trigger for the June protest. The movie < 1987 > deals with the murder of consultant Park Jong-cheol and the democratic movement in 1987. Released on July 27, the movie was seen by 3.32 million people as of July 4, only one week after its release. Politicians and police officers are making such a fuss about it. The security chief, identified by his family name Ahn Joo-yoo (74), told then democratic unification movement chief Lee Bu-young (Kim EuI-seong) that he has more torture police officers in prison. The prison guard (Yoo Hae-jin) who secretly delivered Lee's letter to Kim Jong-nam, is a combination of Han Jae-dong (71) and Jeon Byung-yong. In reality, Han delivered Lee's first letter to Kim Jong Nam via Jeon, and Han delivered it to Kim Jong Il from the second.I met Yoo and Han Jae-dong at the loss of their former archrivals yesterday evening in Namyeong-dong, Seoul. The loss of the throne that killed Park Jong-cheol while being tortured by water has now turned into the center for the human rights of the National Police Agency (NPA), and inside it is the Park Jong-cheol Memorial Hall. Ahn and Han said they met for the first time in decades at the ceremony to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Park Jong-cheol's death in 2012. However, she was invited to a preview with me recently and watched a movie together. "" Asked what he thought, Ahn said, Many times, external tear gas was blown into the jail, but I was impressed by Park Cheo-won and other fictional scenes. Ahn added, I did not know that at the time, Lee Ri-Bak's dove (a person who secretly carried uncensored letters out of jail) was Han Jae-dong. Han also recalled that Ahn was not sure at the time that he delivered the fact to Lee that there were more advisory police. The scenes in the movie are not nearly as good as what they used to be, Han said. As old memories come back, I wished things had not come to that effect again.In 1986, when the Chun Doo-hwan administration was under heavy pressure, there were about 2,800 police officers in jails and prisons around the country. Ahn Yoo-eul : At that time, Yeongdeungpo Prison was short of cells due to the increase in the crime rate. At first, when college students came in, I allocated a room to live alone, but as the numbers grew, I had to put them in the same room as ordinary inmates. I had to assign two or three undergraduate students to go over the block because they shouldn't be concentrated. To deal with them, a security squad was set up in Seoul, the metropolitan area, a metropolitan jail, and a prison guard in Yeongdeungpo in 1986. "" And I was afraid, as chief of security and security, I was afraid of the head of security at Yeongdeungpo Prison. The two men served as an outside source of the truth behind the murder of adviser Park Jong-cheol. It is also a real model for the film < 1987 >. Kim Young-min, journalist of Hanjaedong viola@kyunghyang.com : "" Since the Incheon 5 or 3 protests, the student movement has become stronger. Students in jails or in jail often chanted slogans, fasted and refused to go to war. It was a sign of protest against the military regime. The criminals and prisoners of state were imprisoned without charge, so I had to resist, but I also had a lot of friction with the guards in the process. At the time, students and prisoners of conscience called the guards the handmaidservants of the regime. "" - then-President of the Democratic Unification Movement's Coalition for Democracy and Human Rights were also in charge of protesting against it? Ahn Yoo-yoo : I first met Lee Bu-young when I was imprisoned in Seoul Detention Center from the Dong-A Ilbo for Free Media Action. My high school classmate Lee Bu-young asked me, who was the head of the jail's district, to take him in. We broke up with each other by talking often, but in 1986, when Mr. Lee entered Yeongdeungpo Prison, we met again. I asked him to convince students to protest with group slogans, singles and all that helped me a lot. Lee Bu-young has negotiated as the representative of the prisoners, and former prison chiefs, and the students have suggested their needs through him. Usually, the ministry asked me to bring in books, and I shut my eyes to them. "" "" Han Jae-dong = "" I met Booyoung elder brother in a Seoul prison around 1976. After my brother was released from prison, I went to see him often and to demonstrate with him. I knew most of the criminals in the current situation because I strongly believed in bringing down the dictatorship. After Booyoung Lee's brother entered Yeongdeungpo Prison, he went to the jail at 5pm every day to talk for an hour and left. My assigned workshop was a male employee's studio that ended at 5 p.m. on July 19, but since it was 6 a.m., it was not an official death toll for the police, and it wasn't an official death of Cho Jong-kyung and Kang, who reportedly had been sentenced to one hour in police department. Only five days after the incident, the prosecution's investigation team announced the results of its first investigation, which they acknowledged. Prosecutors indicted the two for violations of the law on aggravated punishments for certain crimes. An arrived at Yeongdeungpo Police Station around 2:00 a.m. on July 20 and there were five people who got off, said police officers wearing the same jacket because they were in charge of the air defense and their faces were not allowed to be seen.There was a lot of people around. An-yu : I did. I was thinking about where to hold the two torture cops. I put it in the same place with Lee Bu-young because it would be a big problem to put together with the prisoners of conscience. Lee Bu-young, too, has assigned her to work for a woman who was not used at the time, because he felt it would be bad for him if he mixed up with the students. Lee Bu-young said through the bars, "" You are also the victims of dictatorships, "" adding, "" Let's just say that it is the first time that prosecutors and prosecutors have offered their condolences to Park Jong-cheol. "" Since I worked at a Seoul Detention Center, I have witnessed countless people being taken to police, NSP and Boansa and tortured. I saw my fellow guards come home beaten like dogs. I figured you'd have other people involved. After the attackers went to Yeongdeungpo Prison, they tried to get to the truth through their fellow prison guards, but it was not easy. Cho Han-kyung said, "" I should read the Bible aloud every day, and I heard that Kang was not singing a song in which he was able to weep in public. "" Ahn reported it to the Justice Ministry and refused to comply with the rules. Police then suggested that a senior official be present and that he should not record anything at all. The jail set up an office in the senior bedroom and provided the police with an audience room. On February 19, six people, including five of the nation's top brass, visited police officers. Ahn heard an amazing story on the table.Ahn Yoo-you : "" Police come to see me almost every day. The visitors came on February 19 and said, ' Take it both of you. Then I'll have her tried soon so she can be released on parole or pardon. For the sake of the governorship, you two are responsible until the end. ' Cho Han-kyung protested by mentioning his colleagues ' names that he actually tortured water. I was surprised. I quickly wrote down the names of the three advisory police officers on my operating log : Lieutenant Hwang Jung-woong, Kyung-dong Kang-goon and Kyung-kyung Lee Jung-oh. They were so absorbed in the conversation that they did not notice what I was writing. '' Ahn, after agonizing for days, called Lee to his office. We were in big trouble. This will ruin the country. I will get out someday, so make a note of it. But Ahn said, "" I was so angry at the time that I passed it on to Lee Bu-young, but I didn't know that it would be immediately revealed to the outside world. "" And he said to me, "" The next day or so, I sat down and all my personal records on Park Jong-cheol. "" Judging that it was information to overthrow the government, Lee wrote it in a letter the same day and sent it out via Han Jae-dong. The letter said the government cut, manipulate, and conceal the murder of Park Jong-cheol, a adviser to the North. Being a pigeon is dangerous, but how did you do it? Han Jae-dong : As usual, I went to see Booyoung Lee's brother at 5 p.m. When Booyoung says, "" My brother Jae-dong, I have a very important story to tell. Bring me a pen. ' I knew by intuition that it was about the police officers of torture Park Jong-cheol. I tore the recycled paper out of the office and handed it over with my pen. Booyoung Lee elder brother asked me to come tomorrow. The next day, while we were holding hands on the bars of the cell window as usual, my brother pushed a few folded letters into my sleeve. That way, the guards you keep won't notice. My brother told Jun Byung-yong, a fellow prison officer, to write so he could deliver it to Kim Jong-nam. I grabbed five fingertips with my fingers to stop the letter from falling out of the jail's gates. "" And when Jeon quit as a policeman, he was being pursued by the police."
"Kim Jong Nam requested Lee Bu-young, Jang Ki-pyo and others to hide and was arrested, so they were accused of hiding the criminal. However, Han often met Jeon secretly to avoid the eyes of police. The letter was delivered to Kim Jong Nam via Jeon Byung-yong on March 15. If Kim Jong Nam, who was also wanted, did not call him, Jeon Byung-yong could not see him either. Jeon was captured by the police on March 17, two days after her letter was delivered. The letter Kim received was not only a letter dated February 23, but was also written on March 1. It was said on February 27 that Ahn Sang-soo, the two prosecutors ' office, visited the three more victims of the harsh acts at the request of the two police and ' Know which side your bread is buttered '. Police tried to reduce, manipulate and conceal the incident after it was revealed on Jan. 14, 1987 that Park Jong-cheol died of water torture during a loss to the National Security Agency in Namyeong-dong, Seoul. However, in a May 18th special mass held at Myeongdong Cathedral, Father Kim Seung-hun (second from the bottom), a Catholic Priests ' Association for Justice, revealed that "" The killing spree of torture by Park Jong-cheol was fabricated. "" Eventually, then chairman of the Democratic Justice Party, Roh Tae-woo, made a 6-29 declaration accepting a direct election call. Trend newspaper footage - Were there no fears or fears about what would happen if discovered? Han Jae-dong : "" Because I'm a human, I would lie if I said I wasn't there at all, but I didn't have any fear. Since Park Chung-hee, I felt that I should drive out dictators to democratize them, and I decided to dedicate myself to it. You shouldn't be swayed by petty emotion. And I've delivered a lot of secret letters from political prisoners before. "" An-yu = "" I was different. I was afraid that if a backtrack came in, I would be falsely accused of being a spy and taken to Namyeong-dong. To be honest, I spent many sleepless nights without even telling my family. I was worried about how to make ends meet. "" - It was a time of intense search, and I didn't have to follow me around to deliver a letter.Han Jae-dong : "" I always looked around at my back because I had something important to do with it. On a bad day, I would take a look around the alleys and change buses, taxis and the subway frequently. But nothing much. "" - Some critics say the security chief's role in the film is glorified. Anyu = "" I'm not a saint. University students have called me "" Chun Doo-hwan's hunting dog. "" The older students even put saltimbab on my face. I feel sorry for my students then. In those days, inmates used to wear plastic bags, handcuffs and cover their mouths when they had trouble with the ancient castle. That's what they were saying. "" - Ahn and other investigators interviewed the torture police on February 27, March 4, and March 27, but postponed a full-scale investigation, saying their claims were inconsistent. Did the guards join us for the meeting?Ahn : "" I was in attendance at the rules, and on that day, I was in attendance, and prosecutor Ahn Sang-soo said, ' Leave when you're investigating. ' "" I guess it was Ahn Jong-cheol who told Cho and Kang, ' Judge by himself, I guess it was Choi Jong-hwan's attempt to cover up the case from the same assistant - Cho and Kang - There was also a cash-and-mortar migration. Kang Min-chang, then director of the public security office, summoned the wives of the torture police and gave 3 million won each to the police, and Lee Young-chang, who followed Kang Min-chang, gave each to his colleagues 10 million won. Chief Inspector Park Chat-won, after signing up for the 50-million-won development trust long-term deposit in the name of an advisory police officer, showed Cho and Kang that they should not worry about the future problems. I have witnessed myself trying to coax the money into the account, Ahn said. However, the government's attempt to cover up the organization was revealed to the world on May 18 of that year. Father Kim Seung-hun, Catholic Priests Association for Justice issued a statement in a shaking voice saying, "" The truth behind the murder of Park Jong-cheol, a soldier of justice, was fabricated. "" The statement was made by Kim Jong-nam, based on a letter from Lee.The waves were enormous. The prosecution, which had already secured the truth and was reluctant to fully investigate the case at the end of February, belatedly set up a second investigation team on May 20 and indicted Hwang Jeong-woong, Bang-goo and Lee Jung-ho. As public opinion failed to settle, police officers including Park Chae-won and Yoo Jeong-bang, who were involved in cover-up efforts on May 29 were also arrested. Prime Minister Roh Shin-young, second in command to the ruling camp, and Justice Minister Kim Seong-ki also stepped down. Security chief Kang Min-chang and Home Secretary Jeong Ho-young were already forced to resign in February, the beginning of the police killing Park Jong-cheol.There were slogans of "" Down with tyranny "" or "" abolish the Constitution, "" which was yelled by countless students and citizens running into the streets. The death of a Yonsei student, Lee Han-yeol, who was hit on the head by tear gas fragments from a riot policeman while confronting a riot policeman in front of the gate on June 9, fueled public anger. In the end, Roh Tae-woo at the time Democratic Justice Party candidate for president accepted direct through ‘June 29 Declaration’. But the June protest, which flared up as a killing spree led to the death of adviser Park Jong-cheol, ended in a ' half success. ' Had succeeded in digging out the president and direct elections, but failed to regime change. - How did you take it? Han Jae-dong : "" Personally, I was very upset and vain. I should have pushed down Chun a little bit more and accepted an appointment to keep the gang out because Roh Tae-woo's 6-29 declaration made me feel completely relieved. I didn't want to risk my life to fight like this, but I said, "" Anyu = "" I was wrong. Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam, who fractured was expecting it to be president anyway ... because the expense of, bakjjongcheol ianyeol be the cornerstone of democracy. Say nothing their sacrifice will be in vain. "" - Park Geun-hye in 2017, candlelight vigils and impeached former president, Lee Myung-bak is president of the investigation related to corruption and accelerate too.I have it. Even after democratization, corruption at the government level seems to continue. Han Jae-dong : "" Loyalty to the regime is different from being loyal to the state. Many government officials, such as the torture police and soldiers, often say it was for the nation to justify their wrongdoings. They were really for their power and their wealth, and were loyal to the regime, not the state. We should be loyal to nations, not governments. To do so, I need to be able to say no. As long as the people wake up and act conscientiously, the regime is on its own. """
"Kang (44), a businessman working for a large company based in Seoul, has a rental apartment of one. When the government recently proposed a plan to boost the registration of rental businesses, it gave up when it considered registering them. The personnel manager of the company told us that if we do not receive permission from the company, we will be subject to disciplinary measures. "" To get permission to work at the same time, I have to tell the company I'm a multI-householder, but I don't think they're going to say I'm being unreasonable and ask me to save them a few bucks. ""The government is proposing various incentives to boost the registration of rental business operators. However, the results showed that office workers who account for a large proportion of multiple home owners are unlikely to be realistically registered as rental operators.In order to register as a rental housing business, office workers should avoid the prohibition of their own jobs from holding multiple jobs because they need to obtain the permission of their institutions or their company representatives.■ As it is difficult to register business operators in the "" no concurrent jobs "" rule, Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport Kim Hyun-mi answers questions from the panel at the National Assembly's comprehensive audit session in Seoul last October. The government announced its plan to activate rental housing registration, which provides benefits such as reducing income tax and health insurance premiums when registered as a rental business on July 13.According to the report, if a couple owns more than two apartments and creates a rental income of less than 20 million won per year, registering as a rental house operator will provide income tax savings. The new plan is to encourage multiple homeowners to register as rental businesses voluntarily, thus stabilizing the rental market.If an office worker registers annual rental income of 20 million won as a rental business, he or she can reduce income tax by up to 710,000 won per year. However, it is not possible to use the registration of rental business if the owner is a businessman or an incumbent, not a retired worker. It is because of the "" prohibition of double duty "" provision that prevents office workers from engaging in commercial activities that interfere with their work.Currently, many businesses, including government ministries, public agencies and large corporations, are found to have no exceptions in banning them from doing so.First of all, government ministries or agencies can not concurrently serve their employees (including business license registration) according to the SOP for serving or disciplinary matters. Only when the work to perform concurrently with a duty does it not interfere with the performance of the duty, it is allowed to be approved by the head of the respective institution. An official at the personnel reform ministry said, "" If I own one or two rental housing projects, I can get permission unless it is a special case. "" But, he said, "" I don't have any guidelines set out for it.Few applicants are known to have applied for permission to hold multiple jobs to register as a real tenant of the Agency for Civil Service and Punishment. It is possible that the tax reduction effect from ' careless work ' may be considered to be due to the fact that the income tax reduction in return is only about 400,000 won per year when the permission is granted concurrently.Public institutions mostly apply the same rules. "" Since the announcement of measures to activate tenant registration, few employees have asked for the relevant regulations, but few have actually registered, "" said an official of the Korea Land and Housing Corporation (LH), the largest state-owned company.Most private companies have a prohibition on holding multiple jobs. Some places can be approved, but others are subject to disciplinary measures for registering a rental business. A personnel manager of a large company said, "" You can rent a home if you are granted the green light, but you can save a few million won a year on business registration. ""■ There is more than just half a plan to activate the desktop administration. Office workers also receive much less benefits than retirenters or businessmen even by reducing health insurance premiums as a result of registration of rental businesses.Office workers registration as rental operators reduces health insurance premiums, but is much smaller than those who are dependent. If the current jobless retired people of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport lose their health insurance coverage as a result of tax imposition of rental income from a small income in 2019 However, if you register as a rental business, you can receive a maximum reduction of 1,120,000 won (an eight-year-lease rental average) in building information. In addition, if the rent income is less than 13,330,000 won per year, the owner of the rental company can maintain his or her status as a dependent.If a work owner with rental income registers as a rental operator, however, he or she can only reduce the annual premium of 80,000 won (an eight-year-long rental average).As a result, some point out that the government's plan to facilitate the registration of rental businesses could turn into a half-professional one that is shunned by employers.A property advisor at a commercial bank said, "" The government should have looked into whether it is possible to apply to rental business owners, "" adding, "" It does not seem to be the case that the typical rental line of work is open to the management.

The Ministry of Public Administration and Security announced on July 5 that the number of holidays this year is 69, the highest in 28 years since 1990. That is when the local election day (June 13) is designated as a public holiday, and two more days are added, one for Children's Day overlapping on weekends and another for Chuseok. Including Saturday, which is not a legal holiday, 119 days are total. If you work five days a week, it is "" red day "" every three days. In particular, if you take advantage of the annual leave, there are seven consecutive holidays that will last for more than three days. First of all, the Lunar New Year holidays are held on the 15th to 18th of the following month. It is a three-day weekend from Children's Day (May 5) to May 7 (alternate holidays). Chuseok (September 22-26) has become a five-day weekend with alternate holidays scheduled. If you take a vacation on September 27 and 28, you can take up to 9 days off. Independence Movement Day is on Thursday, so it is possible to take a four-day holiday off on Friday, and because Buddha's Day (May 22), Hangeul Day (October 9), and Christmas holidays fall on Mondays (December 25). The public sector and big businesses are strongly encouraging people to spend their annual periods between these stepping-stones holidays. This is because the so-called "" work-and-life balance, "" or work-life balance, has spread to improve productivity. But for non-regular workers or low-term employees who can not afford vacations because of their organizational culture or the way they look at their superiors, the annual event is still a pie in the sky. Small and mid-sized employers are also reluctant to take vacations because of the wage hike.

"This month the national pension for the 30th birthday has reached a crossroads. This year, the fourth fiscal calculation, which predicts changes in the national pension fund over the next five years, is scheduled. Based on the financial calculations, the government should establish a comprehensive national pension plan by the end of October to present its vision for future pension protection. Last year, Moon Jae-in, the president ‘pension allowance’ is seen as dramatically increase the design assurance level of the national pension, which even promised. Therefore, it is inevitable that the ‘ rate of substitution of income ’ would be raised. Income replacement rate is the ratio of the national pension benefits to the lifetime average income. If the average monthly income of a national pension subscription period is one million won, but one gets 500,000 won per month as an annuity, the rate of substitution is 50 percent. However, if the annual amount is increased by increasing the rate of income substitution, the time to run out for funds will increase. To avoid a fund starvation, you need to get more insurance. However, public backlash is strong. In order to get out of the dilemma, we need special measures to turn around the people.According to the National Pension Service on July 5, the number of pension subscribers increased fivefold to 21.84 million as of September last year. Pensioners also saw an explosive increase from 1798 to 4.06 million in September of this year a year after the system was enforced. The pension fund is worth 612.4457 trillion won, the third largest pension fund in the world.However, the public's gaze remains cold. It is because of fears of a fund starvation. When the third fiscal calculation was made in 2013, it was predicted that the national pension fund would run out in 2060. The National Assembly Budget Office predicted that the 2058 and the Korean Federation of Tallers, a civic group, would dry up faster in 2051. Depending on the pace of population aging and the economic changes, the risk of a fund being depleted could be higher. Lee Sang-koo, co-president of the Welfare National Association, pointed out that the original purpose of guaranteeing people`s retirement was gone and that it was only a matter of emphasis on provider-oriented perceptions of ` how to keep funds `.The government and the National Assembly have inevitably set forth a plan to curb the income substitution rate each year under the national pension law. Ironically, however, the pension reform served as a tougher barrier to keep people from getting out of the frame of the fund drain.When the pension was inaugurated in 1988, the replacement rate of income was 70 percent, but decreased by 0.5 percentage point each year according to the rule of law to 45 percent this year. After 10 years, it will fall to 40 percent by 2028. This is a nominal rate of income substitution without taking into consideration the inflation rate, but the real rate of income substitution stood at 24 percent last year. If the average monthly income of 2.18 million won over the past three years is applied, the pension beneficiary's yearly average is 523,000 won per month. It is only half of the minimum cost of living last year of 1,040,000 won, which was estimated by the National Pension Institute. This amount will be lower in the future. This year's basic pension will be raised to 250,000 won this year and 300,000 won until 2021 to compensate for the aging income, but anxiety will not go away entirely. Based on the OECD member countries ' average retirement age of 66 or older, the poverty rate in Korea is 45.7 percent in 2015. It is the highest among OECD members.The president this problem to be cognizant of the replacement rate of income in South Korea's presidential election, promised to rebound by 50 per cent. Last year, Chung Chun-sook, a fisherman's representative, proposed a revision to the national pension law that would keep the income replacement rate at 50 percent. Kim Seong-ju, head of the National Pension Service, has insisted on the lowest income substitution rate of 45 percent since he was a lawmaker in 2014. Democratic Party lawmaker Kwon Mi-hyuk also proposed a revision to the national pension law, which would hold 45 percent of the bill.However, the problem is that this type of approach will increase the financial burden. According to the National Assembly Budget Office, if the income replacement rate is set at the lowest level of 45 percent, an additional budget of 18 trillion won or 36 trillion won will be needed each year. From 2051 to 2060, the number of pension recipients rose to 13.58 million due to the aging population. Additional financing needed during this period is 359 trillion won and 719 trillion won, depending on each scenario. Keeping premiums in place could lead to a fund being depleted 4-7 years earlier than the government predicted in 2060, the Office of the Budget Office said.Even if the current system is maintained in the light of such a scenario, there is no big problem at present. According to a mid-term financial analysis by the National Pension Service, the reserve will sharply increase to 789 trillion won by 2021 from last year`s 600 trillion won. However, according to the Budget Office's forecast of 2042, the government's forecast for funds declined sharply as the balance of payments went into the red from 2044, and the funds were exhausted from 2058-60. The increase in premium rates is only a matter of time, not of forever.The national pension premium rate rose by three percentage points every five years from three percent in 1988 to nine percent in 1998 and 4.5 percent for employers. Since then, the ratio has remained unchanged at 9 percent until this year. Government agencies such as the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the National Pension Service and the Korea Institute of Finance have maintained their stance to increase insurance premiums by a further 29.9 percent since the third fiscal calculation in 2013. However, no agency will lead the problem. The reason is because the backlash from the public is an artificial one. Public pensions are required to be subscribed to when they are subject to workers from work. Many people are unhappy with the mandatory admission rules. So the government is even burdened by a public opinion poll on the national pension.Experts point out that before raising insurance premiums, people should check their reasons for anxiety. The problem is the government's attitude to make no promises to increase public confidence and keep making demands that can help stabilize the nation. At the center of it is the ' Statute of National Pension Schemes '. Other word-for-word pensions such as government pension, military pension and private pension guarantee national payment through related laws even when funds are exhausted, but national pension funds do not have a statutory duty to pay wages. Many people point out that the government should make a decision on the legalization of payment guarantees in order to obtain consent for the increase in premiums.In May 2006, when the participatory government met Rhyu Si-min, the welfare minister, mentioned how to guarantee the pension payment legally, but failed to realize it, and Saenuri lawmakers tried to enact the law in 2012, which resulted in opposition from Cheong Wa Dae and the Strategy and Finance Ministry. The Ministry of Finance and Economy argued that the sovereign debt rating would fall as the ratio of national debt rises due to the increase in the national debt potential based on the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In this case, the government or businesses must pay additional interest rates when raising funds from abroad, and this will seriously damage the international competitiveness. It also claims that no other countries in the world guarantee national pension.No country defines pension funds as a potential liability for the general public, and we don`t consider them to be reflected in the accounts, said Kim Yeon-myung, a pension specialist at the center. Pensions with national pension funds, such as military and civil servants ` pensions, are reflected in debt by some countries, including Korea's, but not applicable to pension funds targeting the general public. Professor Kim added, Older Japan has 240 percent of national debt, and if the national pension is held as its national debt, the national debt will grow to 500-600 percent, and the public pension itself is considered to be a debt, nonsense. Oh Kun-ho, co-chairman of the welfare state I make, also said, I think it is possible to specify a guarantee of the nation`s national pension payment if it already works with the law and helps trust in the system.Unlike previous administration, Moon Jae-in, the government is showing significant progress this discussion. Democratic Party lawmakers Nam In-soon and Chung Chun-sook proposed a revision to the national pension system last August that would guarantee the payment of the national pension. We will seriously consider defining the national payment guarantees, Park said in a recent news interview. Chairman Kim Seong-ju also needed to make it clearer to guarantee the nation`s support for pension funds in any case, during a speech at the new administration meeting held at Jeonju Industrial Complex in North Jeolla Province on July 2.There is a controversy over the extent of the premium or when it will be raised. Professor Kim said, "" We have no choice but to raise premiums to prevent the national pension fund from being depleted, "" adding, "" It is inevitable that the income replacement rate, which is the lowest living cost for a single household, would reach the increase of 3 to 50 percent. "" Moon Hyung-pyo, former minister of welfare, called for an immediate rise in premiums, but added that the combined time of depletion of funds could provide a stage-level guarantee of 0.2 percentage points per year since the 2020.Although nothing has been decided, the ministry is expected to discuss ways to increase insurance rates gradually through the fourth fiscal calculation, targeting the 12-14 percent level. In addition, it plans to pay more for insurance, but also receive more pension. Last year, the maximum income limit was 4.49 million won, and the premium for insurance, whether it is 10 million or 4.49 million won per month, is the same as for 404,100 won (4.49 million won × 9 %). The ceiling on pension for government employees is 8.05 million won per month, nearly double the national pension.Experts have cited the retirement pension as the fundamental solution to the national pension controversy. In order to reduce the burden on the national pension fund and strengthen the guarantee of retirement income, the government should actively utilize the pension fund and establish a multI-layer security system. Chairman Oh said, "" We have established a multI-layer pension system utilizing the national pension, basic pension and retirement pension. "" "" The lower levels should ensure income by increasing the basic pension and by encouraging the middle tier to support the retirement pension. "" Professor Kim stressed, It is most practical to have a multI-layer security system through retirement pension as we can not afford to invest in public pensions anymore as we have a large number of individual pension subscribers.Jeong Hyeon-yong, reporter at junghy77@seoul.co.kr"
"Park Seong-eun, a reporter at Yonhap News Agency, said, "" Shouldn't alcohol ads be regulated? "" The Health and Welfare Ministry set up a smoking alert drawing committee on July 4, which was announced by the establishment of a cigarette package. Smoking is strictly prohibited, but the reaction is that it is hard to understand what a popular celebrity advertise for alcohol. In reality, the difference in advertising between cigarettes and alcohol is clear. Smoking is restricted to TV ads, and the warning paintings of 10 kinds in cigarette packs depict the dangers of smoking, such as throat cancer, mouth cancer, and heart disease. Meanwhile, popular entertainers appear in commercials for drinks with pleasure. The bottle is marked with only a warning. Experts point out that cigarettes only show the ' positive ' sides, while cigarettes only emphasize the ' negative ' sides. ◇ effective effect of introducing a warning picture for cigarette packs … The government first introduced a warning picture on cigarette packs on Dec. 23, 2016, when mainstream companies issued warning labels. To maintain its effectiveness, the artist decided to replace the painting every 24 months and hopes to attach the new painting starting December 23 of this year. The effect of warning pictures is high. A recent recognition survey released by the Korea Health Development Institute showed that respondents were more aware of the effect of smoking warnings now added to warning figures than previous ones with warning labels. Three of the four adults also thought the cigarette packs should be bigger. The anti-smoking issue report said, "" The public now agrees that a larger size health warning than a pack of cigarettes is needed, "" and added, "" If the size of the picture grows larger, tobacco companies can use a striking design and a phrase. "" However, mainstream companies are required to write warning labels only. Excessive drinking in the selling containers of liquor is harmful to health, and drinking during pregnancy can damage the fetal health. In addition, related laws also limit TV or radio advertisement time, but they are free to print or advertise online. Lee Bok-keun, secretary general of the Association for Youth Smoking and Alcohol Prevention, said, "" It is a problem that local commercials for teenagers feel they want to drink. "" He added, "" It is a problem that teen envy popular entertainers and encourage their drinking. ◇ Socio-economic costs associated with drinking are decreasing by 9.45 trillion won (465.4 billion U.S. dollars), but the rate of smoking is on the rise. According to the National Health and Nutrition Research, the smoking rate of people over 19 years old decreased from 28.8 percent in 2005 to 23.9 percent in 2016. However, ' alcohol use on average of seven or more glasses per day ' increased from 11.6 percent in 2005 to 13.8 percent in 2016, while binge drinking rose from 36.2 percent during the same month to 36.3 percent. Alcohol is harmful. According to a report by the National Health Insurance Corp., the socio-economic costs of smoking as of 2013 reached 7.17 trillion won and the drinking and drinking costs reached 945.4 trillion won. There are also endless incidents and accidents related to drinking. According to the National Police Agency's ' Criminal Statistics 2016 ', 39.2 % (39.9 %) of all people committed murder while intoxicated in 2016 ; and 28.9 % (18.8 %) of all sexual assault (18.8 %) were violent. ◇ Korean alcohol regulations are loose … French and other countries can not afford to advertise while their regulations on alcohol are lax, experts say. According to the report on the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, the nation's index on drinking policies ranked 22nd among the 30 countries with seven points (perfect score). Korea partly restricts TV and radio advertisements for alcohol, but France, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and Australia are not allowed to advertise at all.[EPA = Combined News] researcher Jeong Young-ho of the New York subway station said, "" The more we analyze adult alcohol consumption and alcohol policy indicators levels for each country, the more related the negative (- 0.52) is. "" In New York, advertisements for alcohol will be banned not only in buses and subways but also in stations starting this January. The New York Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) made this decision last October, saying, "" The social benefits of preventing underage drinking are more important than advertising revenue. "" We don`t take alcohol abuse seriously, said Professor Kim Kwang-kee of Inje University. We regard problems as individual responsibility, not social responsibility. The government needs to actively try to limit the advertising marketing of alcohol companies, Kim stressed. A related ministry official on mental health policy said, We feel a lot about the need to regulate alcohol ads, but the details are yet to be contained.

In response to the urgent report that the hotel is getting filled with water when there are some children, the embassy asked the Chitwan authorities to act swiftly. "" Considering the local situation, it is difficult to find a suitable place to fly or land the helicopter, "" officials said. "" It is possible to mobilize elephants, "" he said. Having obtained the situation, the Foreign Ministry and the embassy requested that "" I hear from the elephants immediately. "" A Foreign Ministry official said, It was a dangerous situation, with as many as 33 people were killed in the downpour. The elephants were well used for transportation, so they decided that they could be rescued. The Korean family safely got out of the hotel by riding an elephant that afternoon. Such a situation could occur at any time to consuls working abroad. The central function of the Consul is to use all means and means necessary to protect its citizens in the host country. There was no one rule of law that made it impossible for seniors to do anything when they received the acquisition or transfer, said a diplomat who served as consul at an overseas embassy. Moon Jae-in, the president last month, the chiefs of Korea`s overseas diplomatic missions ‘protect its people,’ role in a state dinner one Wednesday, praised the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. As volcanic ash erupted on the Indonesian island of Bali, the Foreign Ministry rescued the Korean people by flying chartered planes. The president is "" shall protect the safety and public safety and rights of people in manchansa It is a good example that the foreign ministry moved quickly to ensure that hundreds of Koreans who were isolated from Bali last month can safely return home, the official said. For Koreans and Koreans abroad, the diplomatic missions abroad are like those of the state, he added. Compared with its immense responsibilities, the consular service is in poor condition. The number of Korean travelers to foreign countries is 22 million (2016). It was 44 times larger than the original year of liberalization on overseas travel (1983). The number of incidents and accidents involving Koreans abroad was 14,293 (2016). There are about 40 cases per day on average. Currently, 188 people are working as consuls at overseas embassies. Among them, 65 consuls are responsible for accidents only (55 official residences). As of 2016, the number of Korean consuls who leave the country was 103,488. It is nearly three times more than Japan's (35,5659 per consul) and Australia (16,154 consuls per consul). Although it is physically daunting, in some cases, the Korean consular presence can overwhelm other nations. A case in point is when a coup took place in Turkey in July 2016 and left 110 Koreans stranded at Istanbul Airport. In the aftermath of the coup, the airport was closed and external approaches itself were blocked. Two South Korean consuls of the Consulate General of the Republic of Korea in Juistanbul entered the airport through a blockade while gun battles were fought between police and coup forces. The 110 isolated Koreans safely returned home after staying close to a day at the airports with the consulate. More than 1,000 people from each country were held in airports, ministry officials said. Korea was the only country that the consul entered. He added, It was even said on the scene, It was better for public officials to risk their duty than casualties among the public. This ' one-party mentality ' is essential for consuls. Consuls should go around hospitals and morgue in case of major incidents or accidents, such as terrorism or disaster, abroad. It is hard to determine whether the Korean people suffered damages, so we have to sell the products. When the shooting occurred at the Las Vegas Hotel on October 1 last year (local time), the consulate call center and the Consulate General of the Los Angeles Embassy received requests to locate 145 Koreans. The request was for the safety of family members or acquaintances who could not be contacted. Requests for confirmation via diplomatic channels were useless. The U.S. government is also suffering from a lack of caution and has not been able to cooperate well. Eight consuls and staff went to the scene personally. The results were carried out by visiting 15 hospitals where casualties were confined for two days. Fortunately, we confirmed that there was no harm to the Korean people. One diplomat said with bitterness, "" Whenever I hear of such an incident, my heart sinks at the fact that an Asian patient is found in a hospital. "" We have seen traumatic trauma when we have identified the deaths of Korean people who died abroad, he said. In some cases, the efforts of these consuls are not welcome. Some Koreans involved in crimes even refuse to help the consul at all. "" I have only found our people who lost touch with their families during the earthquake in Nepal in 2015, "" a Foreign Ministry official said on a trip to Nepal to find me. Why is the nation interfering? ' It was a rather awkward experience. After the earthquake hit Nepal in April 2015, the Foreign Ministry dispatched a quick response team to help the Korean people. The plight of the consuls, not well known by the public, is leaving a trail on the Internet. Let's give a compliment on it.Connor also received most of his gratitude for the consul's help while traveling abroad. When she wrote an article on July 19, Nomo introduced her to Chinese who was on a business trip to Shanghai and was robbed of her money. When we notified the consulate general in Shanghai of the incident, the consul told Chinese police, If we don`t do something right, we will make diplomatic problems. I got my money back in an hour. "" When we were robbed, we blamed our country for ' why Koreans are the only objects, ' and watching the matter be dealt with gave us pride as Korean citizens, "" he recalled. Consuls help Korean people escape cars in Kumamoto, Japan, which was hit by an earthquake in April 2016. [Photo : Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade], however, is not very satisfied with the consular service. The Foreign Ministry's questionnaire, conducted via its Web site last August, ranked first among the ministry`s concerns about the public as lacking in service. Among the 2418 respondents, 1238 (51.2 percent) answered as follows. The top priority for the ministry in the coming years was to protect Koreans abroad (42.4 percent). Diplomats stress the importance of the consuls ' initial response. In January last year, a Taiwanese taxi driver secretly slept a Korean tourist and raped her, but the initial reaction of the embassy was also problematic. The victim called Taiwan Representative early in the morning to report the incident, but the officer on duty did not provide enough support to inform police. The ministry was later criticized by the public. The Foreign Ministry is set to open an overseas safety alert center by March. It is designed to deal with major incidents or accidents that occur during the late hours or holidays in conjunction with the consular call center currently in operation. If the Korean consulate call center receives a call, it should report it to the Foreign Ministry, consult with related agencies, and set up a kind of overseas public protection office. Ten consuls who have specialized in accidents or accidents will work for the purpose of providing one-stop service. We plan to increase the number of professional consular staff to 39 this year, said Lee Jae-wan, director general of the ministry`s overseas consular service. We will focus on boosting our ability to better prepare for early responses and prevent them as early as possible. What about charter flights to journalist Yoo Ji-hye's [S BOX] Bali? Last November, 266 Koreans who were stranded by volcanic eruptions in Bali, Indonesia, returned home by charter aircraft. Who will pay the rent for the chartered plane? The government pays for this. The government secured 1.5 billion won for charter flights since 2016, after it had a hard time bringing Koreans home from Nepal in the event of an earthquake in April 2015. The Balinese charter is the first to use the budget. The government is funded by passengers after charter flights arrive. The basic principle is ' ticket to ticket exchange '. People using chartered planes should refund their tickets to Korea from the airline company and send it to the ministry. The ministry set a ceiling of about 400,000 won per person. We have decided on the price of a non-season plane to Bali. If you don't have the Korean ticket you originally had, you have to pay that amount. However, they do not pay extra if the ticket they had is cheaper than 400,000 won. You can submit documents against ticket refunds from airlines. Passengers who had tickets for the business class also returned with business class seats in Asiana charter flights. The "" down class "" situation did not occur for the chartered airplane because the business class ticket and the number of seats were identical. The government received prior consent for this method of payment. As of July 4, 124 out of 266 people have reportedly transferred expenses. ▶ Central Daily [Facebook] [Kakao Plus Friend] [Mobile web] and JTBC Content Hub Co., Ltd.

Leaving the child unattended would be … I don't know what to say because I'm white in the head. I have to pick up the baby in a few minutes, and I would appreciate it if you could take into consideration that, ' Jang Soon-sil, the director of the court, was sentenced to two and a half years in jail on July 6 during the state court hearing. However, the ardent appeal was refused and he was immediately taken to jail. No wonder Jang, who has been involved in state affairs, has to make the right decision, but even his children should not have to endure sacrifices to be separated from their mothers. But the reality is not. Countless children of inmates suffer from the absence of parents, financial difficulties and social prejudices. In other words, children share in the values of their parents ' sins.◇ Set up a Child Welfare Action Committee last November, ` a research service report ` on the human rights situation of children aged around 2000 to be submitted to the National Human Rights Commission of the Republic of Korea (NHRC) showed. In addition, 11.9 percent of the detainees ' families are in desperate need of a security guarantee against basic living by the people. That is more than five times the country`s average supply and demand ratio of 2.3 percent. When parents are imprisoned, most minors think first about how to "" live off the land. "" The situation is better when one of the parents is imprisoned. Children from single-parent families are usually sent to relatives. Some of the children who are poorly cared for by their parents may become juvenile delinquents or, in the worst cases, enter the path of crime. In other words, it is a vicious circle. For children, greater pain than financial difficulty comes from not being able to meet their parents as they please. (Robert Orben) The emotional trauma may last a lifetime. Lee Kyung-rim, who has worked on supporting the children of inmates for three years, said, "" Parents who sin often do not deserve to see their children, but they blame their parents. "" "" No matter what, they are a family, "" he stressed, "" no matter how guilty the crime is, the parents want to play the role of the parent, and the children want to see their mother and father. ""It is also not easy for children to visit the parents of prisoners. It is realistically difficult for minors to go to prisons and prisons around the country without adult help. The prisoners are only allowed access to the jail three to five times a month for each 15 minutes. There are calls for the families of detainees to be allowed to have more of an audience, but the authorities have been reluctant to do so due to lack of staff.◇ Construction of a control tower for the children of prisoners is just beginning to make public statements on the human rights of their children. The government does not have proper laws or systems to manage and support the children of prisoners. A systematic system can be adopted when policies are established at the government level, but it is not clear to the concerned ministries even now. That is why some argue that it is necessary to build a control tower to draw closer cooperation from related ministries, such as the Justice Ministry, the Health and Welfare Ministry, the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, the Education Ministry and the Ministry of Public Administration and Security.Although limited, some are even experimenting with allowing prisoners to spend more time with their families. The "" Family Love Camp, "" which was introduced in 2012 by the campus authorities, is a typical example. It is evaluated as a successful policy by the inmate and his family to receive psychological treatment together under the supervision of an expert. An alternative option would be to include whether or not the accused is a minor child in the standard of assessment. Already, some countries, including Italy, require that the sentence of the accused be considered whether or not to raise minor children. A legal official said, If enough social consensus was formed over whether it would be right to give a defendant with a small child a lighter sentence. Some point out that better social awareness is necessary to solve the human rights problems of the children of prisoners. "" It is still the responsibility of our society to say, ' If you knew what was dear to your children, you shouldn't have sinned, ' "" Lee said. "" But that is the address of today's society. "" We need to spread the perception that the children of prisoners are not the victims of the perpetrators but the victims, he argued. It is important to create a table to discuss the human rights issues of the inmates ' children, he said, stressing, "" It is essential to reduce future social costs. ""What you see next door."
