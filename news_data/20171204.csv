"- I can't go to the principal's office for more than 4 years and I will continue to file suits against the middle school teachers who will stay in the middle schools next year. Even the principal and vice principal could not say a word to the strong parents and apologized to the teacher, "" said an aunt (41), who works at an elementary school in Seocho-gu, Seoul, "" If I don't pass the time of year. "" Last year, they quarreled with second grade students and were released with each other, with one parent demanding that the school board be opened, and then their uncle called them "" judges. "" I want to move my school to a town that is easy to guide students even if it gets a little tired, the teacher said.◇ 20 % of teachers at Gangnam and Seocho Elementary School are experiencing the phenomenon of "" opening of Gangnam, "" an elementary school teacher, in Seoul. Because of the growing number of middle aged teachers who are reluctant to work in Gangnam or Seocho-gu due to complaints from parents. The new teacher is the first in line to fill the vacant position. The proportion of new teachers who want to leave Gangnam and Seocho is increasing recently, while the proportion of new teachers who want to enter is decreasing, said an official at the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education.According to the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education, as of April this year, 41.7 % of elementary school teachers in Gangnam and Seocho areas worked for less than 10 years, higher than the average of 35 % in Seoul. Meanwhile, the percentage of middle aged teachers in those areas was 13.5 percent, lower than the average Seoul teacher of 20 to 30 years. And one out of five teachers at Seoul`s Gangnam and Seocho elementary schools is a new teacher within the past four years. Five years ago, Gangnam-gu (18.8 percent) and Seocho-gu (17.0 percent) had similar ratios to the average Seoul education, but now they have the highest percentages of new teachers in the two regions.Teachers agree that it is because of the high education levels of students and fussy parents in Gangnam and loose demands for a new homeroom teacher. An official at the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education said, The percentage of teachers ` rights violations and civil petitions are relatively high in Gangnam and Seocho."" There were also cases when some parents flocked to the principal's office because of ' the teacher isn't friendly, ' "" said one elementary school principal, but "" Thessen parents, when that happened, the morale was very low. "" An elementary school teacher in Gangnam said, "" There are times when three or four out of 10 teachers are new. "" "" I don't know how to deal with my parents with short time, so I don't know how to deal with my parents, and I don't know how many middle class teachers do. ""◇ City education office, Gangnam, Seocho Special Stay Traditionally, Gangnam and Seocho used to be preferred areas for teachers. It is because of the fact that it is easy to teach students about their lives because their academic levels and home environment are above average. Some teachers were also accused of falsely transferring to schools in the area. It is because of the principle of assigning teachers ` cables to nearby schools based on their residence. The Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education has so many teachers who want to work in the Gangnam and Seocho areas, Seoul, saying, ' Teachers who have worked in the Gangnam and Seocho schools for five years have also wired to other education support agencies. 'However, recent reports have it is speeding up the lack of teachers in the Gangnam and Seocho areas. The city education office has decided to allow the special stay in Gangnam and Seocho from next year. The new position will allow him to work five more years in the Gangnam and Seocho areas, on the condition that he can provide a teaching position with a high workload.According to the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education's survey of students ' status, about 300 elementary schools in Gangnam and Seocho areas need to go out of town on March 1 next year, and some 80 of them are hoping to stay. We are also considering allowing special residence for the next few years and removing the restrictions unless problems arise, an official at the education office said. The first pier collided with a tanker near Yeongheung Bridge in the morning of the day before and was overturned. Thirteen out of the 22 crew members died and two were missing in the accident. Incheon Coast Guard captain and oil tanker captain Yeongheung were supposed to ask for a warrant at the Incheon headquarters of the Korea Coast Guard, Incheon Coast Guard captain and deck guard ship, Yeongheung Island, Tuesday morning when they were on duty on duty in Group One duty at tomatoyoon@yna.co.kr2 in Incheon. The photo shows rescue crew at sea. [Yonhap news agency reported that a patrol boat from Incheon Ongjin County was found to have been rescued, and a fishing boat was attacked by a patrol boat.] (Incheon = Yonhap news agency reporter Sohn Hyung-kyu said.) Based on the statement, the Coast Guard confirmed that the captain, who took control of the plane at the time of the incident, did not make proper efforts to prevent the collision and left the deck guard's office when the accident occurred. Incheon Maritime Police said Monday that they will seek arrest warrants for Jeon (37), the captain of the oil tanker Myeongjin 15, who was recently arrested on suspicion of professional negligence resulting in death. They allegedly crashed into a nine-seven-ton fishing boat with a first-mile fishing boat on the southwestern coast of Yeongheung-do at 6:09 a.m. yesterday, killing 13 fishermen. In the accident, 13 other sailors besides the one who died on board of the first ship were found missing, and seven others were rescued. Captain Jun told Coast Guard officials that I saw (before the collision) a fishing boat but knew I could get away. He was on time for the accident and held the steering machine at the steering room of the tanker. However, another deck worker, identified as Kim, was found to have left the steering room at the time. It is usually known that when running on a tanker, two people work as a group during the early morning or night hours. Auxiliary guards watch ahead and keep an eye on the captain in case of an emergency.The Korea Coast Guard believes the accident was caused when the deck crew, Kim, was absent from the cockpit by the pilot alone while operating a tanker. If the Coast Guard requests an arrest warrant during the hearing, the hearing on the arrest warrant will be held on July 5. The Coast Guard is scheduled to conduct a shipboard examination on board the ship of the first dock at Incheon Coast Guard's main pier along with the Korean class in the morning of that day. Based on the results of the examination, the ship's captain Jun Jeon-hyeon will also investigate whether he was speeding in the accident. Maritime police officials said yesterday afternoon they searched all six crew members aboard the tanker for the accident and arrested two of them today during an emergency arrest warrant for their alleged professional negligence.A fishing boat collided with a tanker and was overturned two miles south of Yeongheung Bridge in Incheon yesterday morning.

"Inside the crashed cabin on the morning of July 3, a tanker struck by an oil line near Yeongheung Island in Ongjing-gun, Incheon, and several fishing boats were found to have collapsed inside. It rained on Youngheung Island, Ongjing-gun, Incheon, around 5:30 a.m. yesterday. The sea was as black as pitch. The time until sunrise is about 2 hours. The wind blew at a speed of 8 to 12 meters per second. The waves were about 1.5 meters high. There was occasional thunder and lightning, but the overall weather conditions were not bad. Passengers climbed aboard the 9. 77-class fishing boat, "" Haeng-gang No.1, "" which was anchored at the port of Jindu. Twenty people, including Seo (37) and her brothers, got on the boat one by one. The cabin filled quickly. It was early morning, so I lay down mostly. The Seo brothers waited to leave the deck. Around 6 a.m., the first dock left Jindu Port. The destination was the sea near Yeongheung Thermal Power Plant, about 4 kilometers away. Fishing here and return by 4 p.m. Shortly after leaving the harbor, the Seo brothers saw a ship approaching from behind. It was a 336 ton-class oil tanker called ' Myeongjin 15. ' The 15th edition of Myeongjin was immediately closed. The Seo brothers shouted at the steering room. We have a tanker coming. It's bound to crash. "" There was nothing in the cockpit, as if it had been drowned out by the waves and the noise of the engine. The first pier sailed as it was. With a bang, Myeongjin 15 crashed into the left rear part of the pier. The fishing boat turned over like a leaf. The Seo brothers and three other sailors on the deck were thrown overboard. They managed to hang themselves from styrofoam from the boat. About 10 minutes later, Myeongjin 15 lit a light for the sea. `` Here is a person. Help me. "" I managed to get up by the net I had dropped off. A 42-year-old man who was rescued by Myeongjin 15 after escaping through a broken window. After the accident, Captain Myeongjin No.15 and Shim (31), who was trapped on board, reported the accident to 12th place. Rescue workers began at 6:42 a.m. when patrol boats and helicopters arrived at the scene of the accident with a high-speed boat attached to Incheon Coast Guard's Yeongheung Police Box. The rescue team rescued three people who were trapped in the cabin. However, most of the other 11 were found drowned. What divided them into life and death was what was called an "" air pocket. "" The three rescued men survived about an hour and a half in an empty space after the boat turned over quickly. Two people, identified by their surname Kim (42), were found two kilometers away from the accident but were still dead. Some people said that they had missed Golden Time to rescue the Coast Guard. Maritime police arrived on the scene in 33 minutes after the announcement. The underwater rescue team also arrived around 7:17 after the accident.

"An Apartment Park in Jamsil, Songpa-gu, Seoul. Experts are also divided over what is happening to the market. Experts say that the further supply of more than 1 million homes is expected to worsen as the supply of goods to be sold quickly, coupled with the downside risks of higher housing prices and interest rates. Meanwhile, other experts expect the price to continue to rise in Seoul, as the supply is still low. According to the real estate industry on July 4, since the roadmap for housing welfare was announced last week, inquiries about sales have increased to the brokerage industries in Seoul and the Seoul Metropolitan area and online communities.The government said on July 29 that it would provide one million homes for the public for the next five years, including 650,000 public rental housing, 200,000 private public-supported rental apartments and 150,000 publicly-leased apartments.◇ Shots of a sudden drop in sales and housing prices? = In fact, when the road map was announced at an apartment complex in Seoul, it was found to be cheaper than the market price, so it was analyzed as if it was a result of a busy sale by individual owners. One significant drop in sales could be the flare of a decline in house prices.As the sale price was several million won lower than the market price, we received a deluge of phone calls from customers, an official of Songpa District said in an interview, adding, We have been receiving phone calls since then. Premature sellers expect the government`s plan to provide 1 million homes with public housing at the end of this year and to induce a sluggish housing market, coupled with downward pressure on the economy to follow next year.It also points out that the supply driven policies could have negative effects as the volume of housing has already poured on the market since this year. About 379,000 apartments nationwide moved in this year, up 30 percent from 293,000 last year. Next year, the largest number of households in history, 443,000, will start moving in. It is the first time that the volume of apartments has exceeded 400,000. It is about twice the annual occupancy rate of 240,000 households during the last five years (2012-2016).In addition, multiple residents who have been watching for a long time could pour out the sales volume early this year to avoid the high tax burden that will be enforced starting next April. In addition, the Bank of Korea has set out to raise interest rates in the first time in six years and five months, making borrowers with high reliance on loans increasingly burdened with interest. The government's prediction of various regulations on lending starting next year is too much for the market to handle.◇ There is no plan to control housing prices in Seoul ... On the other hand, some analyze that the increase in supply will not have much influence on Seoul. If Seoul fails to control the price of its home, the overall price increase will continue. First of all, it is not easy to secure more land for housing in the Gangnam area, Seoul, where housing demand is growing. The government is planning to provide 70 percent of the 1 million households with housing in the Seoul metropolitan area, but it is not easy to get housing because Seoul lacks land and only the nearby metropolitan area has green belts left.As a result, the areas in which land can be secured are limited to only part of the right of business. Experts point out that it is difficult to solve the supply of public housing when it is supplied with more public housing because the supply in these areas is already high. As a result, Seoul will continue to experience a rise in housing prices, and the polarization of housing prices will decrease outside the Seoul metropolitan area and provinces. Many are skeptical about the supply of a million homes. It will take some time for the government to secure land for housing and start construction. In addition, it is not easy to finance the project, and some say that if the supply plan goes awry, housing prices could rise further.An industry insider said, "" The real estate market may have a big influence on the sentiment of the market as a single sudden appearance of sales may sway the market flow. "" "" It is likely that the second fiscal quarter will continue to be an inflection point during the first four months. ""[Asian business reporter Cho Young-ju] : Household debt and national debt, which are charged to one household in Korea, have exceeded the average of 100 million won this year. Household debt and national debt have both increased sharply in recent years, while household income remains flat and household debt burden is growing as interest rates have risen. → → slowing production and consumption, reducing disposable income tax led to greater employment and welfare budget with growth led by Moon Jae-in, and in a vicious circle of reducing the government's investment income.Gets the concerns that the result of the opposition.Asian economy self-analysis on data from the Bank of Korea and the National Statistical Office on July and September of this year revealed that households ' credit was 149.1 trillion won. Based on this year`s estimates of households by the National Statistical Office, the average household debt is 72.69 million won.The national debt exceeded 663.87 trillion won as of yesterday, based on the National debt clock of the National Assembly Budget Office. The national debt per household is worth 34 million won. The national debt clock is forecast to grow by 40 trillion won to 666.9 trillion at the end of this year from 626.9 trillion won at the end of last year. This year, the national debt will grow by 12.7 million won per second.When combined with household debt and national debt, they are bearing a debt of 666.9 million won per family. Even when the total number of households (as of November last year) recorded in the ' 2016 Census of Population ' is 188,000, household debt and national debt amounts to 107,150,000 won and 3,460,000 won, respectively.As of the end of last year, household debt amounted to 67.67 million won and national debt was 31.6 million won, which resulted in household and national debt levels of 99.27 million won. As of the end of last year, household debt and national debt amounted to 134.5 trillion won and 626.9 trillion won, respectively, divided by the number of households (838,000 households) that were surveyed last year.Income is at a standstill The monthly income of nominal households in the third quarter of this year was 453,700 won, up 2.1 percent from the same period last year. However, real income decreased by 0.2 percent from a year ago to 439,000 won per month. As real income remains flat, the economic sentiment of households has not improved. The rate of national debt increase is much faster than that of GDP. The national debt more than doubled to 626.9 trillion won last year from 282.7 trillion won in 2006. The ratio of national debt to GDP also rose by 9 percent to 38.3 percent during the same period.As the government is sharply increasing its welfare and work budget, many predict that the deficient budget will have to be filled by issuing government bonds. The increase in national debt will worsen the nation's fiscal soundness, and therefore can not be extended indefinitely. That means a tax increase is inevitable. Although it is only an increase in corporate tax now, it is more likely to draw out cards such as an increase in income tax for the middle class, a reduction in tax payment, and an indirect tax increase. The tax increase means a reduction in disposable income.A surge in household and national debt together could throw the economy into a vicious cycle at the same time, with no increase in household income. Economists agree that the government-initiated income driven growth policies are not sustainable, and therefore, it is necessary for private businesses to promote investment and employment in order to create a virtuous cycle in supply.Professor Sung Tae-yoon of Yonsei University said, It was desirable to increase income by hiring the private sector to boost household purchasing power and revive consumption, adding, It was not desirable for the government to make an optimistic mid - to long-term revenue spending plan.Sejong : reporter Cho Young-ju yjcho@asiae.co.kr ▶ Sign up for Asian economy on Naver (click) ▶ Yang Nak-kyu's "" Military Story """
"[Hankyoreh] [Future & Scientific] The possible location of pressure plants underground during the suspected scenario of measuring objects is less than the actual size of the earthquake, and the magnitude of impact is less than 2.0 and less than 10 times from the "" Earthquake Ground Source Distance to 10. "" The U.S. Geological Survey and the University of Colorado Joint Research Team published a series of papers on the issue of the Oklahoma Generalized Earthquake in July 2014 and June 2015. The previous study found that out of the 80 large waste water plants in the oil region, four were responsible for 20 percent of the total earthquakes in the central part of the United States, and caused earthquakes in places as far as 30 kilometers away from them. Previous studies had shown that the area of induced earthquakes was less than 5km. Furthermore, the paper points out that the area affected by hydraulic pressure will continue to expand, increasing the risk of large-scale earthquakes if it encounters a large fault. The second paper reveals that it is more likely to trigger earthquakes than other regions that are pumping 300,000 barrels (about 35,000 parts per month) of water per month. There are stored groups of pneumonia resulting from the extraction of oil and gas, as well as storage of oil storage tank by the process of pumping surfactant into and pumping up the remaining oil underground. The research team reported that 66 percent of the boreholes that triggered the quake were used to boost oil recovery, but the magnitude of the earthquakes caused by pneumonia spoons and rheum was 1.5 times larger. As earthquakes started at the oil field in Oklahoma in 2009, where earthquakes hit 3.0 or more times a year, academic journals analyzed the cause of the 2011 magnitude of 4.7 and 5.7 earthquake. The article has drawn attention since it raised questions whether the Pohang earthquake on July 15 was caused by the injection of water from geothermal power plants. Lee Jin-han, professor of Earth and environment science at the Korea Geology Association, held an emergency forum on July 24, saying, induced earthquakes refer to earthquakes that people produce through engineering work. The reason for an earthquake by injecting fluids was divided into the cases in which water flowed into the layer, causing a greater amount of friction, and indirectly influencing the gravitational load, thus creating a greater shift in stress. A 6.6-magnitude earthquake on November 6, 2011 in Oklahoma, the United States, knocked down the walls of homes. The U.S. Geological Survey analyzed that the earthquake was caused by injecting waste water into underground storage tanks in neighboring Wilsetanos Plain. Provide the U.S. Geological Survey ■ "" Low artificial ground floor geothermal systems (EGS) are the future of geothermal power. "" The aftershock from the Pohang earthquake has died down, but whether or not the earthquakes were caused by the injection of more water from geothermal power plants, the questions remained whether or not. At the heart of the controversy, the Pohang geothermal power plant is one of the new and renewable energy development projects that began in December 2010, and drilling began in the summer of 2012. Geothermal power is commonly used to generate electricity by pumping hot water, which exists in the ground or is artificially created, and turning turbines with the steam. Water boils at 100 degrees on the ground, but it exists even when it rises to 150 to 180 degrees below ground. Geothermal heat is created by the heat stored in the Earth during its creation, plus the heat generated by the decay of the radioactive isotopes in the rock that makes up its crust. Either geothermal heat is used directly, such as hot springs, district heating, or indirect geothermal power is used, such as electricity conversion. In addition, the geothermal heat, used to cool buildings, can be maintained at 16 to 18 degrees Celsius throughout the year when the ground is lowered by about 100 meters. The geothermal heat pump in the Sejong Building supplies more than 20 MW to provide more than 38 % of the heating and cooling load. In particular, geothermal power can be supplied with energy regardless of weather effects, unlike solar and wind power generation, so it is receiving attention as renewable energy which will handle base load. As mining was developed to the depths of several hundred meters from the 16th to the 17th century, it was known that the temperature rose up as the ground floor went under the mine, but in the 18th century, precise temperatures were measured only with the help of thermometers. The use of geothermal heat as an energy source was first discovered by boron production plants in the region of Laderello, Italy, in the early 19th century. The iron boiler was boiled with boron mixed geothermal water to evaporate the material, using geothermal water as the firewood decreased. By 1904, geothermal power generation from geothermal steam was first introduced here, and in 1942, it was so commercially successful that it produced 128 megawatts (MW). In the World Renewable Energy Status Report, published by the Global Network for Renewable Energy Policy in the 21st Century (RE N1), the world's geothermal energy equivalent was 13 gigawatts as of the end of last year. The country with the most geothermal power is the United States with a capacity of 3.6 gigawatts (GW). Philippines (1.9 GW), Indonesia (1.6 GW), New Zealand (1.0 GW), Mexico (0.9 GW), Italy (0.8 GW), Turkey (0.8 GW), Iceland (0.7 GWl), and Kenya (0.6 GWz) are represented as the major powers. Last year, geothermal power saw the biggest growth among Indonesia (46 percent), Turkey (44 percent), Kenya (6 percent) and Mexico (6 percent). However, geothermal power is still so small that 2 % (International Energy Agency's "" 2017 Renewable Energy Report "") of renewable energy power generation in OECD countries. (Click on the [Click to expand] ■ Earthquakes happen in geothermal power development? The best place to build geothermal power is in a volcanic region. Because steam can be drawn up from the ground to turn the turbine. Even with lower temperatures, a lower boiling point refrigerant is sometimes used to generate steam to turn the turbine, resulting in binary generation. As a characteristic, geothermal power is installed in volcanic areas by more than 90 percent. Recent developments have resulted in an artificial geothermal layer, or ' artificial storage layer, ' to overcome the regional limitations of geothermal power, said Song Yoon-ho, director of the Center for Strategic and Technology at the Korea Institute of Geological Resources. In the geothermal field, we call ' EasyAS ' the future of geothermal power. It is becoming commercialized in Germany, France, and America. Pohang geothermal power plant is also ' Easyes. ' When water is poured into a borehole (injection well) by drilling down to a depth of 4 to 5km, the water flows through cracks in the ground and the water heats up. The Isies system develops the energy by drilling and pumping out other borehole. Pohang has built two 3.3-kilometer-long boreholes with an interval of about 500 meters between them of 8.5 inches (21.6 cm). About 13,000 parts of the water were poured into the borehole from January 29 to September 18 of this year. The highest volume of water injected per day was 18-19 December 2016, with 1763 parts per unit injected over a two-day period. In addition, water was drawn through a bore starting March 4, and 5,841 parts per unit were drained. On November 15, the day of the Pohang earthquake, 6957 ㎥B of water remained underground. As water is pumped out from geothermal power plants, pressure is transferred to the ground, acting as a stress that produces earthquakes. In fact, a total of 63 earthquakes were measured at geothermal power plants in Pohang during this time. Among them, more than 2.0 earthquakes occurred 10 times, and on April 15, a relatively large earthquake with a magnitude of 3.1 occurred. If no water injection was carried out individually, water injection was carried out 12 times. Unfortunately, four earthquakes with a magnitude of 2.0 or higher was completed on the basis of the Korea Meteorological Administration's earthquake. An earthquake measuring 2.2 on December 23, the day after 3681 ㎥ was injected on December 15-22 last year, and an earthquake measuring 226 on December 26-28, was observed on December 29. On April 15, the day after the water was poured into the system, 3.1 magnitude and 2.0 magnitude earthquakes occurred again. It is a known fact that earthquakes occur when geothermal power develops. We develop it by controlling the size of earthquakes not to increase. Another geology expert said, 95 percent of the world`s geothermal power plants cut through a drilling hole in a wave. Water can not come to a standstill until it digs into a volcanic crater. Pohang geothermal power plant was developed while researching that it also has a rupture zone. But no one knew it was an active fault until the earthquake hit. (Click to expand) ■ "" Water injection is too small "" vs "" hydraulic long lasting effects "" Some scientists say Pohang earthquakes are caused by too small an earthquake caused by geothermal power and too small an earthquake. Based on studies on how strong the rocks will withstand resistance, it takes millions of tons of water to generate the equivalent of 5.4 on the scale of the Pohang earthquake. It is questionable whether the injection of tens of thousands of tons of water into Pohang caused a major earthquake. We estimate that the well-prepared fault by the tidal movement is terrible. In fact, Australia had 27,000 earthquakes in the last few weeks in geothermal power development, but only three were of a size. When the hydraulic pressure was removed, the induced earthquake plummeted. Australian authorities especially report that the energy generated by the induced earthquake is small compared to natural earthquakes of the same size. Australian researchers have concluded that the right speed of injection (earthquake) can be controlled. A study by the Icelandic Geological Survey in Melbourne, Australia in 2015 also showed a report of "" no water from any of the nine geothermal power plants, and most likely no resulting earthquakes occurred at locations beyond 2.0. "" Hong Tae-kyung, a professor of Earth Systems Sciences at Yonsei University, said, "" The cost of the rain (b) showing the frequency and magnitude of earthquakes is"
"There is a saying, if the value is 1, it means that the size of 4 times, the size of 5 times. In Pohang, it is difficult to explain the earthquake as it occurred three times on the scale of two and one time on the magnitude of three, but it was not explained very well on the basis of the induced earthquake. In Oklahoma, the oil field holds waste underground to keep it under pressure. Oklahoma's 5.6 magnitude earthquake occurred when an enormous amount of water had been underground for many years. Pohang geothermal power plants, on the other hand, can be pressure controlled by systems that are accompanied by pouring and discharging. In geothermal power, the induced earthquake is known as a minor earthquake of about one magnitude. Professor of Earth Environment at Seoul National University Lee Joon-ki also said, If you analyze the moment tensor that indicates the combination of forces that produces seismic waves, it is possible that the Pohang earthquake occurred on a complicated fault plane, unlike a typical earthquake. But it is unlikely that they were affected by high pressure fluids. It is also questionable whether the pressure from the injection of water was maintained since the last injection of water at geothermal power plants was on September 18, two months before the Pohang earthquake. Professor of energy systems at Seoul National University Min Ki-bok said, When the magnitude of 2.6 earthquake hit Basel, Switzerland, it took five hours to stop pouring water. There were already hundreds of powerful earthquakes. In Pohang, it is hard to understand that the earthquake occurred two months after the water injection was completed, and that the magnitude of the quake was 2.3 and that it had already hit 3.1. But when you look at the glass house data that the U.S. Geological Survey explained about induced earthquakes, they are triggered 10 miles (16 kilometers) away from where they were poured. In addition, the Geological Survey estimated in its simulation study that 10 years later hydraulic pressure will be affected to a much greater extent (24km). Professor Lee Jin-han recently released a paper that analyzed, The magnitude of 7.5 that occurred near California, U.S., 10 years ago could also be a induced earthquake. (Water injection) is mistaken as the cause of the Pohang earthquake, and has triggered a trigger (trigger) that could cause more shocks while the plates in the area move and stress builds up. Scientists create a scientific model with some data. However, the scientific model is not the final verdict. If anything else is raised, we modify it and if it is not, we dispose it. (Click) ■ There is mixed opinion on stopping other geothermal power projects due to the Pohang earthquake. Some geologists point out that a thorough geological investigation is needed before the massive civil engineering works. Professor Lee Jin-han said, It is hard to conclude in a few weeks whether geothermal power development acted as the cause of the Pohang earthquake. The selection of the original site was wrong. It is quite difficult to find underground faults, not indicators. We need to drill or explore the Earth's physics to find thin faults, and we have been conducting large-scale civil engineering projects and conducting geological investigations as a formality. However, some argue that it is hasty for Pohang's example to stop the search for storing the underground water of Ulreung-do Island. Due to the high geothermal pressure, Ulreung-do, a former volcanic region, was believed to have good geothermal water resources in its soil, and was ready for a test and drilling. Switzerland, Basel, has given up on the conclusion that a stronger earthquake could occur after three years of research. Switzerland, however, has not stopped developing geothermal power from other regions. It is not desirable to stop all geothermal power research and development due to the Pohang earthquake.

"Foreign men called by the police and an antique boat from the time of the accident.‘emergence of a North Korean agent’ in Japanese coastal villages in the North Korean wooden boat and bodies have been constantly spreading fear. The Japanese government announced a full-scale crackdown on the growing illegal fishing of North Korean ships in the exclusive economic zone, and residents were afraid of strangers, holding the door tightly shut.A blizzard started on July 1 when eight North Koreans were drifting on the brink of starvation over a crude wooden boat. Heavy snow blocked roads for four hours by Shinkansen and two hours afterwards by rail. East Sea is in front of a fishing village, a simple village is the country a recent months, nefarious rumors are rampant and heaved as to the already famous in Japan.Local residents gathered at the office of the fisheries cooperative in Honjo Nishime, a town located near the coast, talked about eight North Koreans who showed up in wooden shells. According to residents, a doorbell rang at 11:25 p.m. on July 23. It is impossible to remember the daily life of a fishing village ending at 4 p.m. When the woman approached the door with her mind suppressed, she could not understand foreign words. "" Two men in shabby clothes were standing, and a frightened woman rushed to the police station (phone 110) without opening the door. Hisako Sasaki, 43, the office's secretary of fisheries affairs, said, "" I was from North Korea and I was floating on the sea for a month. It was reported that when two people rang the doorbell, the other six hid in the warehouse in front of another house to avoid the cold.The first contact of the North Korean wooden boat was made by a lighthouse 15 minutes away from the town. There is a dock at the scene called Honjo Marina. The yacht club has about 90 members who have their own boats anchored to it. Kaneda Takafumi (31), an official of the North Korean mission, said, As the ship was washed away by the waves one day after it was found, rumors were running around that North Korean agents were smuggling in the air."" I heard eight fishermen, but I honestly doubt they came for anything else, "" he said. "" If they had guns, I would have been scared, and it would have been really bad for Japan. "" We hope the sea security force finds them early so they can avoid going into town, Ganeda insisted. A woman with a child on her back said, We are now avoiding access to the forest along the coast and fixing locks on every house.The Honjo Nishime region in Akita Prefecture, where eight North Korean men arrived by sea, was frozen with fear. ▽ Glass Hon-Joe : Only the wooden boat of correspondent Park Seok-won was found … '' One reason residents in the town were so frightened by the intrusion is because of the discovery of the 10-meter wooden boat next door. The ship remained empty, let alone corpses. Konouramichi NikahoshI, 20 minutes away by car, had a more serious atmosphere. "" At 6:30 a.m. the fishermen found a wooden boat capable of carrying 8-9 crew members on the breakwater, and the police dispatched Karakata (here, squid), "" said Katata Katada. Although North Korean ships were forced into the country several years ago, it`s strange to flock to the west coast en masse like they do today.Some looked unhappy, saying, "" It may be a stowaway. "" One of them was told why he was so sensitive. It is very significant that the ship was found without its crew. The surviving agents may have already left the boat and landed successfully, the official said. A resident said, There was no rumor that the spies were invading the coast in the face of North Korea`s abduction of Japanese citizens, adding, There were no people inside who were forced to accept the charges. As a matter of fact, the Niigata Prefecture has been plagued by rumors of an abduction by North Korea in the past. Takafumi Kaneda, manager of the Russian marina, explains where eight North Korean men have arrived. Yu-ri Hon-jo (Akita Prefecture in Japan) : Park Seok-won, correspondent of the Seok-won Institute of Foreign Studies, said, "" It's almost like 20 kilometers from the coast, "" adding, "" It's almost impossible to say that Noura's voice is as awkward as it was in the 1940s with an antique tile. "" It is inconceivable that we could reach Japan with such a small power of 100 horsepower, said the amazing thing : It is hard to go 20 kilometers from the coast to the south. North Korean fishing boat were found in Japan in Wonsan, Cheongjin, North Korea's East Sea Coast 600 to 800 kilometers away from the main port area. Analysts say the reason why most bodies found were in a condition of white bone is related to this. The ship was guided by Gonoura and went out to the breakwater to check the wooden boat about 50 meters away. It was so damaged that it was hard to recognize its shape. According to the Japan Coast Guard, Coast found in the past five years drifting fishing boat from North Korea full of 80 cases and the 45 to 65 per year since the early 2013. The number of bodies discovered has also soared from 27 in 2015 and 11 in 2016, and from July 15 when international sanctions on North Korea were tightened. At least 18 ships have been identified in Aomori, Ishikawa, and the Sahat Prefecture, 32 have been rescued and 18 bodies have been recovered. A strong north-west wind is expected to spread throughout the winter, with the trend expected to early next year. The fishermen are set to form their own patrol to closely monitor the coastal areas, said Nishime Ahima Tsutomu, a Hindu governor of Akita Prefecture, expressing their deep anxiety and atmosphere. ▽ UrI-Honeration of Glass = Park Seok-won, special correspondent, Abe government's administration, says, "" Devastation of fishing grounds by illegal fishing "" The Japanese government is warning that North Korean fishing boats are destroying Japanese fishing villages and undermining fishermen's interests. The Maritime Safety Agency has launched its first large-scale crackdown on the island since July, and has been removing it through water cannon. Japanese authorities have forced to evacuate more than 1900 items by mid-month and plan to increase the current 62 by more than 1,000 tons to 69 patrol ships by 2021. Major local governments have filed requests for the improvement of the operation control of fishing boats in North Korea since July. Tokyo is more desperate to stop mass refugees from entering the country than anything else. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the House of Councilors ' budget committee on July 29, We are certain that the heavily armed spies can ride and will certainly kill us, and Japan's deputy prime minister Taro Aso, who is armed with refugees. Rep. Aoyama Shigehanhal of the Liberal Democratic Party argued, North Korean defectors can have smallpox viruses.

"▽ New Delhi = In New Delhi, India, Sri Lanka's cricket players stop wearing masks and discuss countermeasures on the second day of a trial game with the Indian team due to severe air pollution. ▽ Seoul : In New Delhi, India, during a game between Indian and Sri Lanka cricket teams, several players were forced to vomit during which time the game was stopped due to air pollution. It is the first time that international events have been suspended due to air pollution, the Guardian pointed out on July 3 (local time). As the winter approaches, major Indian cities, including New Delhi, where air pollution is already serious, are experiencing extreme air pollution. India and Sri Lanka's cricket team held a exhibition game at Peroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi on July 3. The Guardian said the air pollution level was 15 times higher than the WHO's allowed. The game started in this situation, and Sri Lanka's athletes demanded the referee stop the game for 20 minutes, saying, "" I can't stand it, so I need to see a team doctor. "" The game started again but was stopped twice and again as some of the Sri Lanka players experienced difficulty breathing. Still, the players finished the game to the end, and the result was a victory for India. Sri Lanka coach Nick Potas told reporters after the game was suspended, Our players vomited on the fields, even received oxygen from the locker room. It is not normal for athletes to go through this during a game, "" India officials said. Some players, especially, continued to vomit when they returned to the locker room. I don`t think this is the first time in my life, he added. However, the Indian Cricket Association said, "" There is no problem. "" It is questionable why the Sri Lanka team makes such a fuss when there are 200,000 spectators and the Indian team is all right, said CN Kanah. Schools closed in November in New Delhi as levels of air pollution rose 40 times the WHO standard and doctors claimed a health crisis. Air pollution levels in New Delhi at that time were found to be similar to the effects on the lungs of smoking at least 50 cigarettes a day. aeri@newsis.com[Hangyes] Fisher of Incheon Fisher and Hangyeograver : "" Even though the sea is deeper than empty space, I wonder if there is enough water to fill up. "" "" I felt like the sea coast guard was beating a little too hard, and suddenly the boat crashed, "" said Lee (33), who survived the accident on Yeongheungdo fishing boat, on July 4. She explained that it was impossible to avoid an accident or escape from the ship because the ship was filled with water in an instant. A fishing boat, the "" pier No.1, "" collided with an oil tanker off Incheon early Monday, killing 13 of the 22 and leaving two others missing. Lee is one of the seven rescued, and got on a fishing boat as usual with two of his friends who often went fishing. But the accident happened nine minutes after the ship left the dock. Lee and two friends were saved by an air pocket built in the interior steering room of the main pier. Air pocket is where you can stay in a boat and breathe with air that you couldn't get out of when it turned over. The pier was made of fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) material and collided with a tanker and did not sink entirely and was partly floating on the surface, according to the Coast Guard. "" It was less water-filled. I think the sea would have been a little deeper. We had as many as our heads. One hour after I reported it, the Coast Guard couldn't come. Anyway (Coast Guard) came. We were out of breath when we came. We were all in the middle of a rush of air. "" Just now, Lee's friend was using a water-proof phone that would keep him in good contact with the water. At 6:10 a.m., he called the police using a waterproof phone. The photo was taken using mobile phone app and sent to the location of the accident via text message. According to Lee, as the tide went out, the missing air began to flow into the air pocket. As the water in the steering room began to drain, the captain's door was in sight. "" When the water ran out, I could see the entrance to the captain's room. So I screamed because I thought I would be able to hear it from outside. ' There's someone here!I said (out of doors) Oh, there's someone here!"" I heard him say, "" Lee said, "" when I saw the escape and the watch, it was about 8:30. "" It is almost two hours since the accident happened. Lee has returned home from the hospital after completing an examination. `` I'm so sorry to hear of the dead. We don`t have time to evacuate because it happened so suddenly by force. Among the seven survivors, four of them were rescued by tankers. The Coast Guard searched the inside of the boat using a crane barge to recover fishing boats, but two of the missing men have not been found yet. Lim Jae-woo, Goh Han-sol, gija A sign announcing the implementation of anti-smoking laws is posted on the pool hall on July 3. Starting today, the government banned smoking at indoor sports facilities such as pool halls and screen golf courses due to the Enforcement of the National Health Promotion Act. Choi Hyun-kyu : Changed Law and Understanding of Smoking Looks Hide from the Guests, and a screen says, "" Enjoy Your Own PC Balloon. "" The screen golf course is equipped with a fine of 200,000 won. As usual, Chinese restaurants ordered sweet and sour pork and played pool. However, there was no sign of smokers smoking on the pool table. When the reporter asked, "" Can I smoke? "" the host said in a calm tone, "" You are not supposed to smoke while playing billiards, "" and used the smoking booth inside. The billiard hall has set up a smoking booth in preparation for the enforcement of the law. The booth was big enough for four adult men. Inside were two ashtrays. "" Customers may feel uncomfortable, but what can they do about it because the law has been enforced, "" said the billiard room owner, who should get used to it very soon. Customers also seemed to understand the new law. "" It is good to smoke less, "" said Mulle (59), who visited here after playing billiards with a friend, adding, "" I have no complaints because I can obey the law. "" Yoon (34) also said, There is no limit when it comes to complaining about smoking rights. I went to another party stadium in Yeouido, but the situation was similar. Smoking booths were in the making here. The owners of the pool halls said, We are setting up smoking booths because customers may experience inconveniences. Screen golf courses also promoted the revised rules and encouraged customers to stop smoking. A screen golf course official in Yeouido said, We have already implemented a anti-smoking policy from the previous day. Other regions were also preparing to install smoking booths during their journey to minimize inconvenience to customers. "" Although we are promoting non-smoking areas, it is still difficult to make sure we enter the private space and offer to smoke in the rooms we are using, "" said an official of another screen golf course. The guidance period is until March 2 next year. The Health and Welfare Ministry announced on July 3 that the revised law on public health last year designated pool halls and screen golf courses as non-smoking areas. Currently, 2,280 billiards halls and 9222 golf ranges are registered. There will be a 100,000 won fine for smoking in non-smoking areas."
"Captain of the Oil Shiper said, "" I knew it was close to the fishing boat. "" It happened only about 1.85 kilometers from the port, and a Coast Guard rescue boat arrived on the scene 37 minutes after the accident. All the passengers were wearing life vests. Still, it was the largest sea accident since the rollover (15 people killed and 3 missing) accident on Jeju's Chuja Island in 2015. Massive damage occurred due to the impact of the collision and the strong currents in the affected areas.◇ The ship crashed into a tanker five minutes into its departure, and the ferry that was overturned headed south from its port of Jindu, Yeongheung Island, Ongjing-gun, Incheon at 6 a.m. yesterday. Two crew members, Captain Oh (70) and 20 fishermen in their 20s and 60s were aboard. The Coast Guard also checked on the boat before leaving to make sure all passengers were wearing life vests. We followed the 22 crew members who reported normally, so we had no problem sailing.Five minutes after takeoff, the ship collided with the 3.6-ton oil tanker Myeongjin 15 at a point 1.85 kilometers from the southern port of Jindu. Myeongjin 15 left Incheon Harbor at 4:30 a.m. and was on its way to Pyeongtaek Port.The fishing boat's pier quickly flipped over. Fifteen people were trapped in the boat, and the other seven were thrown overboard. Seo (37) and three others were on the deck of the boat when they crashed into the sea. They were rescued after catching styrofoam from floating around and drifting for 10 to 15 minutes. "" They said, ' We have lights coming from behind, ' but within a minute, the front of the ship suddenly went off, thinking, and crashed into the back left side of the boat. ""Maritime police and the Navy used 63 warships and 11 aircraft to rescue the scene. Three of the 15 people aboard the ship were rescued at 7:43 a.m. after staying in the cockpit air pocket (the air space remaining on the overturned boat) for an hour and 38 minutes. We were able to call one of the passengers in the air pocket and let them know the rescue conditions by talking for about an hour, a Coast Guard official said. Song (42) escaped from the ship through a broken window and was rescued. The other 11 were killed. The Coast Guard rescued six of the eight men who had fallen into the sea. Four of them survived, but two died. Captain Oh and her husband's aunt (57) were missing.◇ 9.77 tons per hour of collision and the nearest land (stone island) is 400 meters away. The passengers were all in life vests. But no one swam out. Experts say the crash would have caused a mass death, with the victim unable to escape due to fainting spells.Accident Shipping-Changing authorities rear-end an overturned fishing boat's pier on a collision with a tanker near Yeongheung Island in Ongjin, Incheon yesterday. "" If you guessed that the holes in the hull of a fishing boat were over 336 tons long, it would have been a high-speed collision for both ships, which would have been more than 9.77 tons per hour, "" said Ko Un-ho, a navigation professor at Korea Ocean University.Professor Lee Jang-hyeon of the Department of Marine Engineering at Inha University said, "" If the boat leans at 20 to 30 degrees, the ship will be in an Abidochan so the passengers could have knocked out completely from the roof. "" Meanwhile, the large-bodied tanker suffered only minor damage but no casualties.High-tech ships are also hard hit by other vessels that weigh even more. In August, the U.S. Navy destroyer, Aegis destroyer, collided with Liberian-based 3,000-ton tanker off the Strait of Malacca. After the collision, the Aegis warship was inundated with water from the compartment, killing one person and missing nine others.◇ The accident scene is near Yeongheung Bridge. The sea looks wide, but with rocks around the land, it is known that the passage of ships is limited. Maritime police say they were trying to pass through the stream but ran into it because of overlapping directions. Lee Je-nam (61), a fishing boat operator at Yeongheungdo Island, said, The accident scene has rocks and the sea lanes are winding. It is possible they were speeding to get to each other first, as there was always a fixed place to go.The vessel is equipped with radar to detect incoming vessels. The same goes for fishing boats. But this time neither of the ships bought nor saw the other ship approaching. There is a possibility that the captain and his colleagues don`t really see the radar or were sleepy and did not look ahead, said Im Nam-su, a professor at the Maritime transportation system at Mokpo National University.Another fishing boat captain said, It is not uncommon for the fishing population to increase in recent years to pre-empt ' per capita ' and speed to meet the day's schedule. The Coast Guard is investigating the cause of the accident by lifting the pier around 4:30 p.m. The hull of the first pier was ripped to the left and bottom, leaving a hole in it.[Incheon = Kim Sang-Hyun] [Battle Reporters of Seoul : [Go straight to Chosun.com] The U.S. military media scout warrior reported on July 3 that the U.S. Air Force launched a local operation to equip the F-35A with an upgraded version of the Smart Bomb, GBU-49`s Faveway 2. The laser-guided 500-pound (226.7 kg) bomb was developed for mobile target attacks, but was unable to operate with stealth fighters such as F-35A. It is because during the early stage of stealth aircraft development, such as F-35A, they were designed not to have the most sophisticated software available to hit the moving target (Block 3F).The U.S. Air Force's F-35A stealth fighter jet [Yonhap news photograph], and the clusterbrain, or the CBU-78B aircraft, are enough to beat ground transportation targets. But the situation changed when cluster bombs were blamed as the "" main culprits "" of mass civilian damage due to the problem of non-explosion and the international community decided to ban the use of cluster bombs. The U.S. Air Force decided to install the latest Block 3 F software to integrate short air-to-air missiles and small precision bombs (SDB-2) into stealth aircraft. Thanks to the Block 3F software, the U.S. Air Force has gone to the GBU-49A unit to automatically destroy mobile targets, instead of the GBU-12 bomb that requires the clustertan and pilot to manually obtain them. U.S. Air Force has adopted a GBU-35A stealth fighter jet [U.S. Air Force provided] with laser-guided precision bomb, and has adopted a GBU-49Paverway contract. Todd Canderberry, the United States Air Force F-35, has raised the expectation that "" operating GBU-49 in F-35A will greatly enhance the combat performance capability of this fighter jet. "" Another official said Raytheon plans to provide the U.S. Air Force with 1,200 GBU-49Paverway bombs and guidance equipment under its contract, and announced the test by A-35 earlier this month. An official added, "" If the test results are positive, the U.S. Air Force will operate 400 units of the first delivery of GBU-49bomb on F-35A by January next year. "" GBU-49Paverway 2 measures 3.5m in length, 277kg in weight, 14.6km in range, and 80kg in warhead. The error (circular error in the likelihood, CEP) moving away from the target at 70 kilometers per hour is only 9 meters. Meanwhile, the ROK and the U.S. Air Force mobilized 24 stealth fighters, including the F-22 Raptor, the F-35A 6 and the F-35B 12 Air Force, in South Korea from July 4-8. shkim@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"

The drill, five days after North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM-15) model on July 29, is likely to become a major military pressure on the Korea-U.S. alliance against North Korea's nuclear and missile threats. The Air Force Operations Command and the U.S. Air Force Command in Korea will provide non-seismic ACE training to improve the Air Force`s ability to conduct combined wartime operations from today until July 8, the Air Force said. The Air Force "" has been referred to by 10 air force units under its command, including the 1st, 19th, 20th, 29th, 38, and 39th combat air force, "" and the 8th, Pacific, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Air Force, Pacific Air Force 35. Although the Air Force has been conducting non-selective ace training every year to enhance readiness, the training is considered to be different from the previous training level in size and strength. The United States deployed six F-22s from Kadena Air Force Base in Okinawa, Japan for the drill. It is the first time that the United States has deployed six F-22 fighters to the Korean Peninsula. On July 2, the F-22 Raptors, which arrived at the air force's first combat air base in Gwangju, took off and began training on the Korean Peninsula.F-22, the size of the Korea-U.S. Combined Air Drill Team Non-Self-Access, has excellent stealth capability and is capable of traveling over Mach 2.5 and penetrating the enemy air defense network in secret. It is considered the most dangerous weapon in North Korea, where air defense networks are weak. North Korea has previously shown extremely sensitive reactions, including covering up Kim Jong-un's circulation when the F-22 Raptors were deployed on the Korean Peninsula.U.S.'s latest F-35A fighter jets, the first to take off from a Korean base, are also being put into training. The F-35A is also equipped with stealth capability and is designed to penetrate into enemy airspace. The F-35B, which is equipped with a vertical take-off and landing function, will deploy from the U.S. Air Force base in Japan, and return to the Korean air force base. The U.S. Air Force has as many as 24 stealth fighters in action. Some say North Korea will face unprecedented military pressure. U.S. long-range strategic bomber, B-1b Lancer, will also deploy over South Korea during the training exercise, according to reports. In addition, six U.S. Air Force electronic and electronic warfare aircraft, about 10 F-15C fighters and 10 F-16s will be deployed at Korean bases to participate in the training.

In the event of an emergency, the U.S. is conducting a state-night drill using the Joint Mission Order (ATO), a joint operation plan that assigns 700 North Korean core target planes to South Korean aircraft. It is unusual that the Pre-ATO application of the Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Training was announced. The Air Force will also launch a close strike on North Korean soldiers who threaten the Seoul metropolitan area, and practice to block the intrusion of North Korean special forces into the sea. Regarding the training, the Air Force explained its capability to continue operations through real-time operation and control of the Combined Forces Command (CFC), and operated a 24-hour war effort and a 24-hour war effort to support the Korean Air Force. The North's Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland defined the exercise as a stern military provocation that puts the already sharp protests on the peninsula, pushing the nation to terrorize its own nuclear war situation and thus strongly restrained.Take-off F-35A fighter jet [Yonhap news photograph ]ljglory@yna.co.kr ▶ Report and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting latest trends (click!)"
"▽ Set target for management supervision = Companies are setting targets for recycling. According to the U.K. Daily Financial Times on July 3 (local time), world leaders and environment ministers will prepare guidelines to save waste that has been tainted by plastic ocean speculation at the third United Nations Environment Conference in Nairobi, Kenya this week.Environmental groups at the conference agreed to introduce a Marine Waste Management Supervision Act and set up the first national or regional targeted plastic waste reduction measures. The amount of plastic ocean waste thrown into the sea each year is enormous. U.N. Environment Program Secretary General Eric Solheim said, "" At present, the weight of the plastic thrown into the sea will be equal to the weight of the fish by 2050. "" "" The plastic waste is being dumped hundreds of miles in northern Norway. "" According to the United Nations, the number of plastic bottles in the world totaled 480 billion last year and is expected to grow to 583 billion by 2021. More than half of the world`s sea-polluting plastic comes from five countries - China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka, according to research by Professor Jenna Jambeck of the University of Georgia in 2015. Professor Jambeck's team forecast that if the current trend continues, the annual amount of plastic waste to be dumped in the sea will reach 28 million tons by 2025. Because of these concerns, some countries are already taking substantial action, including banning the use of micro-small micro-face and limiting the use of disposable plastics. In Taiwan, around 90,000 companies in 14 industries are being charged a fee for plastic products and micro-bits will be banned for cosmetics products from the middle of next year.Global businesses are joining in on the move. Computer maker Dell decided to use 70 tons of marine plastic waste each year for product packaging, and Coca-Cola and its household goods company Unireber have also solved the problem by collecting and recycling plastic for product packaging. "" As we looked at it, we realized that the problem was not just the effects of plastic waste on sea life, but the effects of waste on the overall food chain, "" explained Phillicibar, Dell's global vice president. "" Given the exponential growth in plastic production and limited amount of recycled plastic, this is an equation that can never be solved independently, "" he said. Professor Zambeck warned that the global community is approaching a "" tipping point "" point on the plastic waste problem. mong0716@yna.co.kr and inquiry (Click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (Click!) The murder by a central police station in Daegu during the "" Private Eye Service Office "" scandal involving a woman who was allegedly stabbed to death during the "" Central Korean Central Police Station "" robbery. The investigation team of the victim's son, who became a detective 13 years ago, finally arrested and handcuffed the criminal in the mysterious murder of a karaoke hostess.Detective K (31. & sergeant) of the Daegu Central Police Station lost his mother on June 25, 2004. His mother (44), who sometimes used to work as a temp at her brother's karaoke booth to pay for her children's tuition, left a criminal (48. imprisonment) who would argue, "" It's expensive to drink. "" Detective K, who was a high school student at the time, could not approach the scene at all. The police blocked the scene because they feared a shock to their family.The investigation was arranged, but the criminal was not caught. Although the family is suffering from a deep grudge, the incident has been included in the files of the U.S. long term, leaving the warehouse covered with dust. The event was forgotten. However, he joined the police force and became a dream detective in 2013 after working at a police station. He lived almost entirely at the scene of the accident. The mother case was always on his mind, and though countless people roamed the scene and went through investigation records, he had no clue whatsoever.Time has passed and the years have built up to conceal some of the pain. She almost gave up on her mother's case. Then the criminal suddenly appeared to him.A 22-year-old woman who was on her way home from Daegu around 11:50 p.m. on July 21 was blunted out of her purse. Police confirmed the scene of the criminal's smoking on closed circuit TV around the scene, collected dozens of cigarette butts there, and sent them to the National Institute of Scientific Investigation. Detective K could not even imagine the gunman was a mother killer.The DNA from one of the butts were matched by a cigarette butt from the mother's murder scene, which was being kept in a long-term unsolved case file. There was clear evidence that the two criminals were of the same sex. His pulse went wild. Police soon set up a detective team, an American criminal investigation team, and a criminal profiler at the Daegu Police Agency. But detective K, who is always on the scene, is told to "" get out of the investigation team. "" Police have prevented possible accidents if they are encountered.He went on a long vacation as investigators caught the criminal by questioning and undercover. Although he wanted to catch the criminal himself, his colleagues comforted him.Even now, it is hard to think of his mother's case. The criminal was caught, but the old shock has come back to life. However, his colleagues said, "" It is heaven's judgment that the criminal was caught by detective K's team. "" One of the motives of K's becoming a detective was in the mother's case, but when the criminal was put on the line, he trusted his colleague and took a bold step back from the scene, he said.Daegu : reporter Kim Min-kyu whitekmg@hankookilbo.com Yoon Hee-jung yooni@hankookilbo.com In particular, the average daily sales of iPhone X, which was introduced on November 24 and celebrated its 10th anniversary, are estimated to be around 3,000 to 5,000 units.This is far below the daily average of 10,000, which is usually classified as a jackpot phone by the industry. Samsung Electronics ' Galaxy S8 (7,000 per day on average) and Galaxy Note 8 (13,000 units), respectively, are sold an average of 20,000 units per day.According to the industry on July 4, the combined daily sales of iPhone X and iPhone 8 by the three mobile phone companies amounted to 12,000. This is a poor performance compared to the average daily sales of iPhone 7, which was released last year, of 12,000 to 2,000. In particular, the iPhone X sold only 3,000 to 5,000 units, while the iPhone 8, which had been in a decline due to the standby demand of the iPhone X on November 3, saw a significant rise in sales. Industry watchers say the iPhone 8 (1,149,900 won) seems relatively cheap as it costs more than the iPhone X (1,557,760 won on a 256GB basis).Moreover, this is not enough to add up with the combined sales of Galaxy S8 and Galaxy Note 8 which were released in Korea before the release of the iPhone X and the iPhone 8. In fact, the Galaxy S8 released last April has sold an average of 7,000 units per day, and 13,000 units of Galaxy Note 8 were sold in September. Given that iPhone X less than a month old and iPhone 8, which are just a month old, are currently experiencing a "" launch effect, "" their sales are likely to drop significantly over time. In particular, the sales of the iPhone X did not meet expectations, and no shortage of supplies was anticipated.Another industry source said, "" Apple manias actively participated in the pre-sale and the volume was so small that they sold out very quickly and could sell well on the market.Lim Jeong-hwan, reporter of yom724@munhwa.com[ Go straight to Culture datkeom [Copyright ⓒ.copyright munhwa.com ' Only Evening Cultural Daily ' that opens in the afternoon of Korea is prohibited from reproduction and redistribution (subscription : 5501 - 02)"

[Report No illegally redisclocating or redistributing Korea (news1.kr),] [The Dong-A Ilbo] Gwangju : reporter, skyblue, donga.com 4 to 8, the latest U.S. air force to participate in the Korea-U.S. Joint Air Force Training Center is gathering on the Korean Peninsula. About 260 fighter jets and support planes from the two countries ' air force will participate in the drill. It is the largest ever. About 230 others were originally scheduled to participate, but the number increased by about 30 more after North Korea launched an Inter-Martical-15-Continent Ballistic Missile (ICP-DP`s) attack. Military officials said Monday that six F-22 stealth fighters from the U.S. Gadena base in Japan arrived at Gwangju's first combat flight stage on Tuesday. It is the first time that the F-22 Raptors, one of the world`s best fighter jets, participated in joint training. The F-22 is able to reach its top speed from its base in Gadena in less than an hour to Pyongyang at 2.5 times the speed of sound. Super-precision hitting major targets up to 250 km away is possible without being captured by enemy radar. In case of an emergency, Kim Jong Un's underground bunker and his nuclear and missile bases can be removed without leaking a finger. It is unprecedented that many F-22 Raptors were stationed at Korean air bases during and after training, military officials said. It should be seen as a step to step up the U.S. ' deterrence against North Korea's expansion to the Korean Peninsula, which aims to stop Kim Jong-un's "" nuclear and missile proliferation. ""Six F-35A jets, six EA-18G Electronics, 10 F-15C bases, and 10 Gunsan and three others have launched on July 3. Most of them flew to Korea from U.S. bases in Japan. Twelve F-35B stealth fighters and an E-3 early warning aircraft are expected to launch into Korean airspace and return to their base. A B-1b bomber at Andersen, Guam, will also fly to the Korean Peninsula to conduct a bombing exercise under the cover of U.S. and South Korean fighter jets. It is known that the Air Force of Korea and the United States will focus its training on the precise strikes against major military targets in case of an emergency. In particular, the U.S. plans to hold a joint military drill by removing 700 North Korean key targets in the shortest time possible. Jangsajeongpo near the Gaepo Military Demarcation Line (MDL), Sariang Mobile Launch Vehicle (TEL) base, Billan-Jungsan underground bunker infrastructure (Yongbyon, Punggye-ri, etc.), and missile facilities (Dongchang-ri, Pyongyang) are also included in the plant. We need to pay attention to the fact that about 20 U.S. stealth bombers, including F-22 fighters and F-35A-B, are involved, a military source said. This means that the U.S. intends to disable the air defense network (radar, ground-to-air missile) in the early stages of the war and disable the command post in one fell swoop to make it impossible to fight. Meanwhile, North Korean General Staff General Li Myung-soo (who is the chief of the Joint Security Area), reportedly visited the Joint Security Area in Panmunjeom and the security unit in secret. After the defection from North Korea, it is believed that North Korea has inspected ways to prevent reoccurrence, such as digging ditches in front of the MDL, and the North's security situation. The fact that Kim Jong-un's closest aide and top North Korean military officer visited the JSA is a testament to the incident, military officials said.Military reporter Yoon Sang-ho ysh1005@donga.com Living in an apartment building can cause suffering from neighbors who are prevented from smoking. The government has been imposing fines on people who smoke on the stairs or hallways of non-smoking apartments since July 7 to prevent this. Beginning next year, if you smoke inside your home and hurt other residents, the administrative office will have to take sanctions.Residents of apartments and other common homes are greatly welcome, and many say apartments should be designated as non-smoking apartments. It is easy to find the question of how to designate no smoking apartments on the Internet, and the question of whether or not smoking is good for preventing fires, as well as to vote.■ If caught, the flat will cost 100,000 won, "" or "" no smoking apartment "", refers to apartments designated as non-smoking areas in the apartment building by residents. It was first implemented according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare's revision to the National Health Promotion Act on September 3 last year. If the majority of the residents agree, the apartments will be designated as non-smoking apartments and you will be prohibited from smoking in hallways, stairways, elevators, and underground parking lots.As of September, there were 264 apartments designated around the country for non-smoking apartments. Previously, even though they had been designated as non-smoking apartments, they had no reason to control smokers. The legislation says smoking in non-smoking areas will result in fines of 100,000 won, but local governments have implemented policies that have been promoted and passed along through promotion periods. Over the course of the program, fines were adjusted from 100,000 won to 50,000 won, and a revision to the enforcement ordinance was announced on July 7, prompting the introduction of a policy to impose fines.■ "" Can't you smoke at home? "" … Still, it's been a month since the Hot Indirect Bill went into effect, but the debate over the designation of non-smoking apartments and the imposition of fines is still hot. There is a lot of resistance against smoking in your home. There are concerns that especially when an apartment management office worker or security guard comes into the smoker's house and checks it, it is a violation of privacy.Kim Yeon-soo, who lives in Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, said, Of course smokers are frustrated, expressing a negative attitude toward the bill, saying, I don`t understand whether it would be made into a real law.■ "" Baby sleep smells like cigarettes "" … Despite the opposition of the smoking-prone residential smokers, sanctions are also needed for the nature of apartments and the severity of second-hand smoke damage. Soh In-seop, a resident of Dongdaemun District in Seoul, said, I'm in a position to smoke but I don't like the smell of cigarettes, and smokers should be cautious to reduce the harm from second-hand smoke in apartments.Some experts say apartments also have smoking impaired people, and therefore need to be screened. Kim Kyu-sang, director of the Environmental Health Research Institute at Seoul Medical Center, told SBS reporters, It is necessary to emphasize that the majority of residents living in apartments are for children, housewives, elderly people, and smoking-proof populations.What do you think?"

It was confirmed that the arrival at the site was delayed due to the lack of equipment needed for night rescue or to avoid failure or fish farms. It was a desperate time when fourteen ships were trapped. Incheon Police chief Hwang Joon-hyun explained the situation in a briefing concerning the accident at the Central Conference Hall on the third floor of the building on July 4. The accident was reported at 6:13 a.m. to the Pyongtaek rescue team and the Incheon rescue team, each equipped with special personnel and equipment to enter the hull of the sunken vessel and save lives, and was ordered to move. Incheon rescue team in Incheon Harbor is about 25km away from the accident site as a direct route, and the Pyongtaek rescue team in Jebu-do, Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province has its own dock nearby. However, the Pyeongtaek rescue team arrived at 7:17 a.m., 72 minutes after the accident, and Incheon rescue team arrived at the scene only 91 minutes later, 7:36 a.m. It was a relatively nearby coastal area, but some say it is too late to arrive at the scene. In those days, 14 out of 22 people on the first dock were trapped inside an upside-down boat. The Coast Guard explained, "" The Pyeongtaek rescue team could not make a direct flight as it made a detour south to avoid land off Jebudo Island and fishing nets. "" The Coast Guard moved the Pyeongtaek rescue team from the port of Pyeongtaek to Jebudo last year to shorten the response time, but this apparently prevented them from leaving the harbor. Maritime police explained that the affected areas were vulnerable to navigation in shipping lanes. Incheon rescue team had lost its new shape, which could move rapidly even under low water and at night during the two rescue operations. The Korea Coast Guard judged that it would be difficult to operate the structure in accordance with the weather conditions, so it took about 50 kilometers to the Jindu Port of Yeongheungdo before traveling to the accident site by private boat. The first rubber boats from Yeongheung Police Box did not have radar equipment for the night passage, either. This resulted in a ' stop and stop ' repeatedly staring straight into the accident. The raft arrived on the scene 33 minutes after the accident, but was unable to rescue the passengers trapped in its hull because it had to conduct simple ship-line rescue. Considering the weather, geographical conditions and equipments available, we arrived early using all possible means, Hwang said. Meanwhile, the Coast Guard searched all night from the previous night, but found no missing two. The Coast Guard expanded its search from eight to nine areas. Sixty-seven vessels, 15 airplanes, and 82 divers are in the process. The boat may have been washed ashore, so some 1,380 people are searching the coast for cover. In addition, joint on-site inspections are being conducted with the National Institute of Scientific Investigation and Research. Thirteen out of the 22 people on board the first dock in the accident were killed, and two of the ship's captain Oh (70) were missing.

He said, "" We did not save any more lives because it took nearly an hour to reach the place in 20 minutes. ""The Korea Coast Guard said yesterday that the first fishing boat and the oil tanker Myeongjin 15 were reported to have crashed off Yeongheungdo Island in Ongjing-gun, Incheon, at 6:09 a.m. The Korea Coast Guard immediately ordered Yeongheungdo Coast Guard's police to investigate the accident. The police officers arrived on site at 6:42 a.m. riding a riverboat. It has been 33 minutes since the report was received. At 6:26 a.m. before arriving at the Coast Guard, sailors at Myeongjin 15 rescued four survivors floating on the sea. The patrol boat they were on was just a small boat, so we could not afford to do anything about it, the police said. Shortly after 6:56 a.m., a Coast Guard patrol boat, V12 (50 ton grade), found five drifting but was still dead.It was 7:17, one hour and eight minutes after the accident, when the Pyongtaek rescue team arrived on the scene with searchable equipment and experts. After receiving the order to leave at 6:14 a.m., he left for the 20 minutes and arrived at the scene 57 minutes later. The Pyeongtaek rescue team is located in Jebu-do, Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, 8 nautical miles from the scene of the accident. A Coast Guard official said, "" If you run at 60 kilometers per hour, you should be there within 20 minutes, but you were quite late. "" The Incheon rescue team at Incheon Coast Guard's pier, which was 25 nautical miles (46.3 kilometers) from the scene, arrived at the scene at 7:36 a.m.Rescuers joined forces and rescued three others waiting to be rescued from the crashed hull of the Air Pocket. Among them, their aunt (32) was briefly rested and released from the hospital, and the other two were well enough to move to a nearby hospital. As a result, rescue teams could have saved more lives if they moved earlier. The bad weather and special equipment made it rather late for us to arrive on site, the Coast Guard said.Kim Hak-jun kimhj@seoul.co.kr"
"[CBS Kim Hyun-jung's News Show] - Carelessness on the coast, must have missed the radar correctly - Commissions-Building rules - Unwatched sea captain Kim Hyun-jung : :.300 & Company : Fewer than 10 tons of fishing boat collided with more than 300 tons of refueling vessel. As I explained earlier, we were passing through a narrow channel between bridges. It's only 200 meters wide. The large and small ships roamed the bridges between them, about 50 per day. I think it was a predictable accident. Of course, I was wearing my life jacket. They say they went through safety training, but it wasn't their fault, because they had to die in such a terrible accident. Which means he drowned before he could get out. First of all, let's hear what one of the seven survivors told us. [Survivor Insert] With that feeling of being suddenly seen in the dark, the front of my stomach popped into my left stern. We were thrown off the ground in a few seconds after the collision, and we were told to keep alive by the ship that crashed into us, and that was something like a net. Even though we live, I feel guilty and indescribably hurt.◇ Kim Hyun-jung : I bet you have all the radars on ships. And why don't you look ahead and see the captain drive? And I don't really understand how this kind of crazy accident happened. I want you to be a marine engineer. Let's link the Navy's salvage crew. Hello, captain Jin Kyo-jung. How are you? ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > First of all, it has been more than 25 hours since the accident happened. What do you think about searching for missing persons? (Photo : Lee Han-hyung, reporter) in Jin-gyo > I searched the sea with a flare at night, but unfortunately I couldn't find it. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Yes. Whether or not you survive, wouldn't you have to rise to the surface of the water once two of you were wearing life vests? So why can't they be found like this? Of the genuine article, there are two things to look at. One is that the Captain usually goes fishing but doesn't wear life vests. Kim Hyeon-jung > Captain is usually not wearing a life jacket. The reason is that the steering room is too small for the boat. Another person wore them, but if you wear them, they are orange, so the color of the sea is navy blue. I personally saw it as a vest that the colors of colors were orange, and should be visible in the immediate and immediate coastal areas. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > 22 people wore all of them when they started. I checked. But for some reason. Well, I can't rule out the possibility that I went to the bathroom and had an accident with someone else out for a while. De Chingyo > Yes ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > So, does this mean that she must float if she is wearing it? Because life vests, whether raw or not, must be lifted by buoyancy. Wasn't there a lot of fishing boats, helicopters, and ships floating around? ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > > ◆ jung gyo . > So it was not to be seen clearly by binoculars or any object to them. This is a little bit confusing. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > I see. What's the point of being forced to rise. So what are the chances of a cold-minded survival in the next 25 hours? Of the genuine article > I think there is very little chance of survival. The reason is that it is usually two hours likely to survive when the sea temperature reaches 5 to 10 degrees Celsius. The maximum number of trained soldiers is four hours, and now the sea temperature in the affected areas is between 7.5 degrees and 8.5 degrees Celsius. Therefore, my chances of survival are slim because 25 hours has already passed and more than 10 times more than my chances of survival. However, it is possible that they were pushed to land or an island, but now it is possible because they can search on land or an island and have not yet been discovered. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > ` miracle ` is what one can only hope for now, so the search is ongoing. Let me see the cause. The weather has changed suddenly. There are various stories of water channels, but as an expert, what do you think? I see it as careless to sail. Because when you land, it's four kilometers away, and then the waves are one to one, and then it's raining a little, but the weather wasn't at all bad, and the weather at sea didn't seem to change at all. Go right, and left. They have GPS. They have radar on their boat. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > wait, wait. Could it have been a big ship with a large radar, a 300 ton boat, or a small boat? Of course, the fishing boat is all radar. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > Really? De Chingyo ◇ Kim Hyun-jung ; Then, we must have seen each other with a radar. De Chingyo : Yes. I'd have seen it all with a radar. But I think it's both. We can assume both large and small ships didn't just navigate without seeing the right radar. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Not watching closely. Since it is an offshore road, is it possible that you went there? ◇ Kim Hyun-jung is the captain who knows the situation most, but now the captain of the small boat is missing. That's why I was on the boat. The proof of the survivor should be the only clue. Let me hear the survivor's testimony for a second. [Survivor Insert] It was just the dawn and it was foggy or not blind. We left for about 10 minutes, but I think it was a minute or two after we told her there was a ship's light in the back. Because we were thrown away without feeling the abalone, on the left.

(Photo : Lee Han-hyung) ◇ Selections from the Dong-A Ilbo : Kim Hyun-jung > Now Survivors ' testimony was heard. Most of the survivors are the same testimony. I saw a big boat coming in from behind, and it wasn't even a minute before they said, "" Why are you so close? "" And within a minute, they said, they were hit. So the big boat came from behind, and the little boat in front of you didn't find it, or the light from behind you, or the birdlight would have hit you, rather than the collision, and sent you out on your way? When you get closer, you have to slow down and referre to the right and left to pass safely, both of which appear careless to navigate. ◇ Kim Hyun-jung > voyage carelessness. What is the original principle, sir? Don't you have any principles concerning the original traffic? What are the principles of walking through such a small waterway? ◆ When passing through a bridge, it is required to keep the safe speed and reduce the speed when the boat is near so that it can safely pass through the narrow channel while keeping a certain distance. So when the back of the boat is slow and close. Or I will pass you right and left. The front part of the boat is then intended to remain on its course, and pass the other side of the boat. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung : There is a rumor that you should make way for the bigger boat. Isn't that right? First of all, it is a story of how to avoid being followed from behind, or when a boat crosses each other, so when a boat crosses each other, but when it goes in the same direction ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Is it necessary to reduce the speed of the back boat and keep the distance safe? De Chingyo > Yes ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Send a signal to the front of the ship. Do not come signaling actively. I'm here now. Be careful, and do not fail to take any action. ◇ Kim Hyeon-jung > Cause of accident can be understood. But obviously it was twice as bad as that. However many times I have been involved in this conflict, I don't understand how many people die. In addition, one passenger called 112 immediately after the accident. Immediately after the collision, I called 112. This passenger lived. They were rescued during the evacuation from an air pocket. But the Coast Guard arrived on the scene in 30 minutes. So why did they kill so many? ^ Progress bridge > the cause is clear. The oil tanker crashed on the boat, didn't it? People who go fishing in the cabin on the boat leave the dock and wait at the quay to reach their destination.

The woman in Hanbok is holding a coat. On the background of Hanbok, the museum features overlapping scenes at Seoul's major tourist attractions such as Gwanghwamun Square, Gyeongbok Palace and Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP). Below it is the phrase. "" Unforgettable Experience in Seoul. "" This is a tentative advertising Seoul is trying to advertise across New York. From July 18 to July 14, the company had planned to publish 1,000 digital screens in Times Square and Soho and 150 bus stops. The ads, featuring Korea`s charm, will spread across New York to impress 60 million New Yorkers and tourists, a city official said yesterday. I chose this design to convey the mysteries of the Orient as Hanbok experience has become popular among foreign tourists recently, he explained. However, after the publication of the advertisement, criticism was raised that they "" turned women into sex products. "" Online comments were made on the Web, recalling the images of parasitic tours. Women of the images, shows the phrase ‘an unforgettable experience in Seoul, Korea’ to the strange argument that drives the imagination. The Seoul Metropolitan Government then decided not to use the advertisement on July 3. We will scrap the misleading proposal and put out other ads with the theme of Gwanghwamun Square and DDP, a city official said. The ' Seoul promotional material ' has not been reviewed internally by the city. A city official said, "" I could not give proper design guides to my agencies because I was in a hurry to make them, and I failed to get them reviewed in advance. "" The Seoul Metropolitan Government has asked the city's promotional materials to go through a review by the "" Council of Standards and Technology Evaluation, "" which consists of external experts. It is a device to filter out sexist factors. An anonymous expert on women's policies said, "" We have confined the image of women to traditional female images, and the combined silhouette and wording highlighted may create misunderstanding, "" adding, "" The Seoul image of what we are about to introduce overseas. "" Female office worker Kim Min-ji (31) says, I feel like the woman is about to undo her coat knot. It might be an advertisement that can instill distorted sexual awareness toward Asian women. My eyebrows went down when I saw them. A 37-year-old male office worker said, It seems to be the problem with the wording in ads rather than images themselves. Some argue that the suggestive comment is excessive. It is seen as an advertisement for the harmony between tradition and the modern. If you look at ads with a sensitive standard, it is hard to see a variety of creative ads, he said. Office worker Kim Hyo-eun (34) said, I think I express the beauty of hanbok, not the sexual imagination. Seoul ads are part of a joint marketing campaign with New York City, the city explained. Instead of paying for ads in New York City, the city government decided to put up a ' New York Advertising ' in New York City's city government.

At the National Assembly Hall, Dong-Cheol Chung Woo-sik, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, and Kim Dong-cheol, floor leaders of the ruling Grand National Party announced the final negotiation on the issue's budget, including the increase of government officials and minimum wage support. The ruling and opposition parties decided to reduce the number of civil servants, the highest issue, to 9,475 from the original original original 10,221 before the government reviewed the 2018 budget bill. However, the liberal party said it would hold out. The work security fund for minimum wage hikes is to be provided at 2,967.7 billion won, but the financial support for job stabilization funds in 2019 was set up to support indirect work support to the extent that it would not exceed the size of 2018 by directly supporting the National Assembly. In addition, the income tax hike plan aimed at the mini-earning income bracket will maintain the government's policy, adjust the maximum tax rate (25 percent) to 300 billion won or more for corporate taxes, and provide spending to support small and mid-sized enterprises such as fund companies. The Korea Party also postponed its stance on corporate tax hikes. In addition, the ruling and opposition parties set the general account amount for the 2018 Nuri process at 2.586 trillion won, and the budget support for the Nuri Course Community Service could not exceed the 2018 scale from 2019. The payment deadline for children's numbers and basic pension scheduled for April and July has been postponed since September after local elections, with the exception of children aged 0-5 on a 10-percent basis.

Choi Hae-min, a reporter from Ansan subway station, Gyeonggi Province, died at 7:40 a.m. on subway line from Ansan, Gyeonggi ProvinceAs the subway line No. 4 in the direction of Oido was delayed by an accident, the Tonghae Line Train was bound for one, and the train was delayed. The police are investigating the exact cause of the accident. goals@yna.co.kr Youngheungdo, Incheon, where 15 people were killed and missing, did not catch up with the 1-hour fishing boat that was promised by the government after the Sewol accident. They point out that the government should act swiftly in the early stages of the accident, even if it takes into consideration the limits of the uniqueness of marine accidents. According to the Korea Coast Guard and Incheon Coast Guard on July 4, the first captain Oh (70) and his wife, who had been on a fishing trip since the accident happened on the morning of July 3, searched for two missing persons overnight. Thirty-eight ships, including 30 Coast Guard patrol ships, seven navy ships, two Coast Guard planes and an Air Force aircraft were sent to the scene. Maritime police and the military conducted a search by dividing the affected areas into eight areas and dropping 342 flares, but found no missing persons. Maritime police re-searched the patrol vessels to search for the missing. 59 warships, 15 airplanes, and 59 underwater search personnel were dispatched. Another use of 1380 was made to search for land to prepare for possible drifting ashore by missing persons.At 6:05 a.m. yesterday, a fishing boat was hit by a ferry named Myeongjin No.15 (9.77 tons), which was in a stream near Jinheung Bridge near the port of Jindu Island. Only seven people were saved safely. It was the largest fishing boat accident since the crash of a stone fishing boat in September 2015 near Chujiado Island, Jeju Island, which killed 15 people. The boat sank when Yeongheungdo Island was hit by a fishing boat. The clearance was reported and permitted normally. It was raining in the sea before sunrise. The pier collided with Myeongjin 15 at 6:09 a.m., about a mile (1.6 kilometers) southwest of Jindu Harbor. The ship was on its way to Pyeongtaek port from Incheon Harbor. The two were reported to have collided with each other while moving at a speed of around 30km per hour without proper surveillance of the radar or the front in the dark.The rescue efforts were not carried out quickly after the accident. The first report by the Pyongtaek rescue team, which was able to dive into the overturned hull and rescue personnel, arrived at the scene around 8:17 a.m., the first time an accident was reported to have occurred. Rescuers went inside the hull to rescue the three survivors after an accident, which occurred about an hour and 40 minutes. Eleven out of 14 people trapped in the hull were killed.The government has set ' 1 hour on the scene after the accident ' as Golden Time to arrive after receiving information from the sea after the accident, which was announced in February 2015. To that end, another special rescue team for the metropolitan area was set up, and a large helicopter, rescue equipment, and manpower was expanded. Because of the nature of the sea accident, it is difficult to manage the water when passengers can endure cold water temperatures, even if they wear life vests. Fortunately, as the survivor of the accident, it is necessary to rescue them quickly, since they have extremely short survival times depending on the amount of air. However, as in the recent accident, the Maritime Police Agency did not follow the rules of keeping the Golden Time within an hour. The National Assembly's inspection of the nation's maritime police in October revealed that the arrival rate at the accident scene in the past three years was 85 percent, and that the average response time was not significantly reduced from 39 minutes in 2014 to 34.4 minutes in 2015, and then increased to 36.8 minutes in 2016.Meanwhile, the Coast Guard is expected to seek arrest warrants for Jeon (37) and Kim (46), the captain of the accident tanker Myeongjin 15, on suspicion of professional negligence resulting in death. They allegedly crashed into the pier and killed 13 fishermen. The Coast Guard believes Jeon did not make the right effort to prevent the collision when she took the steering wheel of the tanker. Kim was found to have emptied the steering room when the accident occurred. Jeon reportedly told the Coast Guard that I knew (the fishing boat knew it) that he would get away.

Let's talk to Kim Nam-jun, a reporter from the Ministry of Social Affairs. [Question 1] First of all, reporter Kim, the accident report was received nine minutes after the departure. Where exactly was it? Yes, as you can see, there was an accident in the sea 1.8 kilometers from Jindu Port in Yeongheungdo, Incheon. In fact, the accident happened right after the sailing. As you can see, the accident happened when a fishing boat collided with an oil tanker on the opposite side of 336 tons and overturned when the stern collided. Incheon Coast Guard arrived in the accident area at 6:42 a.m. for the first time and is currently in the process of rescue efforts. [Question 2] The rescue team arrived in 33 minutes. What was the rescue situation then? Yes, there were four conditions that made rescue difficult. First, it is darkness. The accident took place at 6:09 a.m., one and a half hours before sunrise, so it was quite dark. Water temperature was also a problem. The water temperature was about seven to eight degrees, and the wind was strong, according to the Coast Guard. If the speed of wind is higher than 14m per second, a strong wind is blowing at the scene of the accident at 10 to 12m per second. Birds have also made rescue more difficult. Today's tidal currents are bigger than usual at 8.5 meters and are likely to drift toward the sea as the tide falls. [Question 3] 20 out of 22 rescue workers in adverse conditions. Thirteen people were still dead. Why are there so many victims? Of the four conditions I mentioned earlier, I think we need to pay attention to the water temperature first. At the time of the accident, the temperature was seven to eight degrees of cold water. Experts say it's hard to stay this hot for long. That's what experts say. [Kim Joo-hyun : Of course, if it takes more than 20 minutes, it could have died, although it is different for each person.] In particular, 14 people were trapped inside the hull, with the boat suddenly overturned. That's why they were more likely to drown than the person who drifted out of the boat. That's why 11 of the 14 people who actually rescued the ship died. [Question 4] Many people who saw today's accident reminded me of the tragedy of the Sewol. Q : Is the government's response improved compared to the time? Moon Jae-in in Korea Coast Guard's Day on October 13 last September also learned its lessons from the sinking of Sewol ferry disaster response system for president left end for gyaeseonhae.

But the good news is that there were many deaths. It is very important to report quickly and to direct. They need a fundamental measure to rescue the victims quickly and minimize them.

Cho said, "" Next year, we will have 20 open - and combinatorial-type schools to serve as the pivotal - growth engine for the general high schools in the Seoul area. "" The school will provide a full range of open - and opention-type schools, including schools by 2019. The Open - Union Choice curriculum leader is a concept of Seoul style of high school seniors considering their regional specialties. Leading schools will develop a variety of education course operating models to expand students ` choice of subjects and serve as a focal point for spreading to other schools. The elective courses will be operated with a demand survey on elective subjects, and then a process of deciding which subjects to open, and counseling and application for classes to choose between subjects will be conducted. The Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education is planning to provide financial support of around 30 million won per semester and extra funds to schools in Seoul to provide facilities such as a combined education space.

"▽ Cut out the communication lines in front of the International Broadcasting Center and put on ice next year's Olympic Committee for the installation of its optical cable. SK Telecom claimed to have consulted with the organizing committee of the Olympics, making an excuse that it was a mistake that could often occur on site, but the organizers of the Olympics had never strongly discussed the issue and using the pipeline in the first place.Police and telecom industry officials say Monday that they have disrupted the operations of SK Telecom and its four employees and installed three communication lines in Pyeongchang County, Gangwon Province, as part of an illegal investigation into alleged corruption of three telecom cables. SK Telecom and its employees have installed the main press center (MPC), International Broadcasting Station (International Broadcasting Station), and a sliding center near the three kilometers of cable relay station, among other communication lines installed by KT for Olympic communication facilities in Daegwanryeong-myeon, Pyeongchang-gun. As the Pyeongchang Games is approaching, SK Telecom is making an allegation that it connected optical cables with its own Internet line and radio repeater when domestic spectators and reporters flocked to the event. KT has signed a contract to provide a total of 333 kilometers of communication networks with OBS, the host broadcaster of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and installed the pipeline from September 2015 to August 2015. The cable will be used to deliver the Olympic Games ' video clips of 12 stadiums and five non-contest stadiums to the International Broadcasting Center and use competitive networks and communication networks. KT will provide this facility to the Olympic Organising Committee during the competition. KT is known to have spent tens of billions of won to build communication lines.Since SKT breaks the Olympic broadcasting network (gray) and installs its own cables (red), an optical fiber cable with five cables is installed inside each cable, and each cable is inserted into the outer impact. Although the lighting cable installation in the pipeline requires approval by the Olympic Committee, SK Telecom did not go through a consultation process with the organizing committee of the Olympics or KT Corp. The inner coffin, which was cut off, was clearly marked as the inner prayer of KT. The investigation began when KT filed a lawsuit with the Chuncheon District Public Prosecutors ` Office late October last month after it discovered that SK Telecom illegally installed the cables while working on the cable. Police in Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province, will take over the incident from prosecutors, conduct a victim investigation against KT officials, and continue investigating SK Telecom officials later.KT Corp., the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics Preparation Committee and the Korean Olympic Committee for the provision of KT Corp. expressed regret over the actions of SK Telecom and its partners revealed. If KT did not recognize their unauthorized distribution, stable broadcasting of the Olympic Games, which are airing on real time around the world, could have been significantly threatened. SK Telecom said, The field operator had a verbal consultation with the organizing committee to set up the mobile base station, mistaken KT pipes as constructor-owned ducts. "" We are supposed to make a mutual agreement with KT and take action against issues encountered while working at the telecommunications facilities. "" "" As such issues often arise, "" the person in charge of handling them should apologize and explain to them later. However, the organizers ' explanation was quite different from that of SK Telecom. "" The IBC pipeline is a very important conduit to the Olympic Games video and audio, which SK Telecom is not allowed to use illegally, "" an organizer with Yonhap news agency said. After learning SK Telecom`s unauthorised routing, the organizers asked SK Telecom to make a quick removal so that it won`t disrupt the construction of the Olympic broadcasting network, but SK Telecom has delayed it one step after another. Meanwhile, KT issued an admission statement on the same day saying, We are very sorry something bad has happened ahead of Pyeongchang, KT said, We will make thorough preparations to lead the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. srchae@yna.co.krThe pier has not been located at all since last summer.Let's explore in more detail with a graphic.A private website that tracks the real-time location of vessels around the world.

A said, "" Better social systems should be provided to ensure that employers can leave their jobs without paying attention to their children's leave than providing cash support. ""She quit her job because she could not do the same job while raising her child. "" I often feel exhausted when I'm wrestling with my child all day. I have no place to trust and leave my baby to live, "" said Mr. B, who said, "" I even applied for a nursery right after I was pregnant. "" Skepticism over the government's provision of a new provision to reduce the low fertility rate is growing. Children's allowance introduced in July next year will be 100,000 won per month for all children aged 0-5 regardless of income level. In fact, the government's much-awaited cash-supported policy for women is unrealistic.According to the ministry on March 3, the nation has been paying child support starting in March 2013 and has spent more than 100 trillion won on the issue over the past 10 years. However, Korea`s fertility rate, or the combined fertility rate of 1.17, remains the lowest in the world.■ Children's allowance and high income bracket are estimated to benefit about 2.5 million people when the subsidy is introduced in July next year because they are more advantaged than the lower income bracket, but the benefit for higher income bracket is more prevalent among the lower income bracket.According to the results of an analysis of the amount of money collected by Rep. The third tier, which is in the middle class, will receive 3.3 trillion won (24.7 percent), and the fifth percentile, which is in the upper-income bracket, 2.8 trillion (20.9 percent).On the other hand, the second tier, which is in the lower middle class, is expected to receive 1.5 trillion won (11.1 percent), and the first tier, which is in the lower middle class, is expected to receive only 1.1 trillion (8.8 percent). The upper fifth percentile receives 2.4 times more than the lower tenth percentile. It is an imbalance because the higher one's income, the more babies one has.■ As of late last year, 31 out of 35 members of OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) have adopted child benefits. The U.K. and Germany paid the entire class an equal amount regardless of income levels, and five countries including Japan and France supported the entire group but were different in price. Eleven countries, including Italy and the Netherlands, excluded high-income bracket workers.However, it is not clear that the birth rate will go up on the basis of the allowance. On the other hand, the combination of various childcare support with the number of children per income tier resulted in an increase in the birth rate. France is the representative country. France introduced child benefits in 1932 but did not stop the falling birth rates until the 1990s. However, the birth rate began to rise when couples who lived together through a radical policy called the Civil Solidarity Convention admitted it as a family form legally like married couples. It provides tax and medical insurance benefits, does not have to follow the surname of the spouse, and eliminates the need for a legal procedure for termination of a contract when the couple is married.As a result, France maintains the highest fertility rate in Europe (2.01 children). In addition, businesses are supporting the lives of their employees by establishing in-house nursery or working remotely, and providing discounts on transportation and tax reduction until the age of 20.■ Child leave. Ars Praxia, a big data analyst firm, posted an analysis of 627,000 articles posted last year on three fertility and childcare communities, "" Momsholic Baby "" and "" 82 Cook. ""Looking through 40,2556 keywords among the postings with more than six comments or recommendations, the number of articles about husbands accounted for half, or 47 percent, with 10,995 articles. Most of the postings said husbands work late and do not contribute to childcare, such as company dinners or travel.They also said that cash support such as children's allowance and baby shower was negative and that more time is needed for fathers to take paternity leave and leave. One Internet user, who said, "" I appreciate the allowance, but I need more time for mothers to spend with my children, "" adding, "" I can't stop thinking about the dark side of the company. "" A year of paternity leave is too short. I wish basic two years were guaranteed, but I hope it will increase to at least 18 months, said the government official, Listen to the mothers ` voices and come up with practical measures to deal with low birth rates.The posting had more than 2,400 hits, and even related replies were asked to "" I want my mom and dad to take a two-year childcare leave every day. "" Employeer`s office would like me to provide childcare leave.Experts also point out that it is more urgent to improve the childcare environment, such as nurturing the working class of the child services and expanding the number of public childcare centers, than cash payments.IT and financial management at Soonchunhyang University Kim Yong-ha said, We are currently providing childcare services to the Department of Foreign Affairs, but with an estimated 30 trillion won per year in jobs for children if the budget and the workforce are vastly insufficient. hyuk7179@fnnews.com"
"■ Broadcasting : Standard FM 95.9 MHz < Focus on Byun Chang-lip > (07:30-09:00) : "" I strongly recommend Byun Chang-lib's Anchor ■ For starters, "" or "" Kim Young-ran, Professor of Law School of Law at Sogang University isn't. There has been a lot of controversy and controversy since the introduction of the Bill. The current government will revise the standard of 3:5:10, the upper limit of meal, gift, and expenses, to 3:5 before the Lunar New Year's Day, and revise the value of gifts to 100000 won, based on the amendment to the agricultural-product system. How does he view the argument as a result of the enforcement of the law on Kim Young-ran's financial difficulties? Now, he is a professor at Sogang University's Law School. Let's talk to Kim Young-ran, former chief of the Commission on National Rights and Rights. How are you?Hello, Kim Young-ran. My name is Young-ran Kim.Woman : Would it be more convenient to call me Professor?How are you doing?Kim Young-ran > I am continuing my second semester lecture because my lecture is not over yet.I will take the final exam and now I will be busy until the end of the year.Promoters > It was the beginning of law enforcement last year. Professor Kim once stated that he was afraid that the law would allow for a safe soft landing. Do you think it's been soft to date on a large frame?Kim Young-ran : I think it's a better soft landing than I thought.Is that what you see as a presenter or especially at the national level?Yes, it is.☎ Do you feel the presenter > changes?I don't know about Kim Young-ran -- I don't know about my age or I, but I don't know if it's the young people who have just become parents, or the people who have just started as public officials, and I think it's a great idea that these people are going to support me in the future.So, you see the hosts of the future are standing firm in your support of the Kim Young-ran method and adapting.☎ presenter > Yes. The Government is steadily pushing up the amendment. Did you expect it to be revised when the Commission's revision was submitted? Or did you expect it to fail?> ☎ Kim Young-ran said she believed that's the last time I I know by presidential decree is on that amendment. Now you're not and now law. Article 3, 5, 10, now a Presidential Decree. So now the Cabinet meeting is a good idea. So that part of the Cabinet meeting in the last time some possible by the Presidential decree, just trying to rewrite some parts I understand.> presenter > But since you didn't make it, what did you expect? I personally > ☎ Kim Young-ran said she believed I do because the president will probably talk about it while I understand you have said the prime minister and several of the Ministry of Food.A lot of talk, I can relax it a bit from interested bodies than mitigated because you doing. Me too.You did it. I assume you're also concerned that it would harm the law in a big way? It's not okay to answer, but in principle, it's forbidden. If you really can't make it, you're a government employee, and you could be your childhood friend. If you can't make it to a wedding, for example, or something like that, the private sector and the public sector could get together to work together and eat.☎ presenter > Sure.☎ Kim Young-ran > The standard amount offered or the amount needed in such an unavoidable case is basically prohibited altogether. You were even in trouble for banning even a single can of coffee.☎ presenter > Yes. And carnations aren't available, too.☎ gim ran yeong deun , > ye, so whatever it is going to be 3 ·5 or 10, this is basically a prohibition, because it would bring up a clause that would be exceptionally stiff. The numbers. I was thinking that way basically.Promoters > You think we already have a good root in our people's minds.Yes, it is. So this amendment wouldn't make a big difference, but it wouldn't make any big difference, and I think it would have given you a discussion that wouldn't have made any big difference, and the original intent of this law was to make you forget about it, three or five.I say three, five, ten thousand times a day. I'm sorry.Kim Young-ran > Sure. It is easiest and most convenient if you think you shouldn't.How about another revision to the ceiling on food, gifts, and expenses, or discussing next year's Lunar New Year's Day, so why not do this? The basics do not change. We've all helped by easing the three five or ten arguments a little, which is beyond our control, and I don't think we can touch it.☎ The presenter > What are the proactive ways to help? And some businesses that need to be encouraged also have to be directly promoted by the ministry, and I really have helped with this amendment, and it is now a huge question whether the cause is actually the revision itself. If you really want to revise it, I hope it will work, but if you do, you will. And if you say, "" Is it really effective? "" or, "" If you say, ' I have done enough, ' then you can ask, ' What is it going to do? ' or ' Don't you know, don't you want to answer me wrong? ' or ' Don't answer me, don't answer me, ' or do it? I hope it works. If you really want to revise itSo you don't think it's enough to adjust the price of a shipment by 50,000 won.I wonder if you can feel it with your skin.Hey, you might have seen the latest news, but recently, there was news about credit card use during the past year. The consumption of agricultural, marine products and their credit card use decreased initially but increased overall. Corporate cards increased by 26 %. But now it is unfortunate that the increase is mostly in imports and fisheries products. What would you say to the question of whether farmers, fishermen and fishermen need help?Since you said so, it is very difficult for me to answer, and I say it is now necessary to increase the amount, but since there is a limit on the price, it would be difficult to pay promptly.> presenter > Of course, the amount of entertainment we use at our bars and five-star hotels has decreased significantly.So, you know, our consumption patterns are very high, personally, but when it comes to government employees, or teachers, or people like this, they pay the price in expensive ways.So, I feel sorry for the agricultural sector in the process of doing so, and I feel sorry for the farmers, but if that is not the right way to go, I think it would be better for us to reverse that direction. Because of the overall increase in usage, I am sorry to ask you a question only about the Kim Young-ran Act, but it is not Kim Young-ran > No, it is not. For that is the issue.☎ I will change it to presenter > You see it's settling well in the big frame.☎ jinhaeng presenter > recent. Conflict between the courts and prosecutors has come to the fore as the courts have released the suspect detained through the intention of the enemy's arrest. How do you view the current judge who even made public accusations, citing the defense of the district justice concerned?Kim Young-ran : Actually, I've been a judge for a long time, so judges don't really know if I was in the position of not reading the records and I wasn't really aware of the truth about the release of the case, or if I was right about the release of the truth. Because what's known out there and how the record is different, and it actually has its own standards, and it's not the case that AI trials, so it depends on individual standards. But don't argue after you've made a decision and a decision, and it's not allowed. That's something that you can't avoid and you can't avoid.☎ presenter > Okay.Kim Young-ran > But the argument isn't enough to let us know that we're in good health and that we need to embrace diversity in our society."

SK Telecom explains that it is a "" simple mistake, "" but KT says it is a clear criminal offense.According to the telecommunications industry on October 4, SK Telecom and its employees are accused of cutting the cable pipes of KT owned in Daegwanryeong-myeon, Pyeongchang-gun in October and installing their own optical cables illegally. The corresponding communication lines are located near the Main Press Center (MPC), the International Broadcasting Center (IBC), and the ski jumping station. The inner coffin was marked as KT's, and there was an empty appearance beside it.KT confirmed the damages on its communications agency on October 31 and sued SK Telecom and its employees for interference in business and destruction to the prosecution's Yeongwol branch on October 24. SK Telecom has already illegally taken over the telecommunications center on Sept. 4, a KT official said, We have damaged several communication lines so far, all of which we have caught. SKT (right - red), in its manhole located 42 meters from the IBC. It is a scene where an internal optical cable installed by SK Telecom with the right lights broken into by three Olympic broadcasting networks (left - and - red). KT has signed a contract to provide a total of 333 kilometers of communication networks with OBS, the host broadcaster of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and installed the networks from September 2015 to August 2015. Optical cables are vulnerable to changes in weather and external shocks, requiring geostasis. In such a case, place 4 to 5 inner tubes inside the cable to prevent it from being stripped of its cover and point it into the cable. The installation of an optical cable in the corresponding pipeline must be approved by the Olympic Committee. We accidentally cut the inner tube of KT while talking to the organizing committee orally to improve traffic quality, the organizers said, but we never told SK Telecom about the use of ducts. "" The pipeline is the point where the cables from the 12 stadiums for the Olympics and five non-captains are delivered to the IBC, "" said an official of the organizing committee. "" SK Telecom had already put the optical cable inside the stadium. ""Introductions and cables are property-specific, written or colored. The installer can not help but notice the company`s signature, said KT, much to cut off the inside lines of KT, although empty exterior can be discussed with the organizing committee. KT officials said, If there is a breakdown during the Olympics, KT should take full responsibility for it and consider it an apparent offence. We regret that something unsavory happened before the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, a global festival and a national ambassador, was called into effect, KT said in an interview this morning.

"ITC, Inc., Inc., Inc. packaging technology, started to talk about using a card policy to build up pressure on Korea's semiconductor industry, the world's largest. According to the semiconductor industry on July 3, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) decided to investigate whether the memory module products of SK Hynix violated the patent rights of domestic semiconductor companies on July 28. SK Hynix's memory modules and related parts, including DRAM integrated circuits installed in computer main circuit boards, are investigating whether or not the U.S. semiconductor company Netlist infringed on them. ▽ Graphics = Lee Jung-kwon's Korean headquarters, SK Hynix America, and SK Hynix memory solutions were included in the U.S. SANUSE. The probe also followed the formula ' ITC that works when a U.S. company competing with Korea raises a suit. ' Netlist filed a patent infringement suit against SK Hynix on Oct. 31. U.S. customs authorities say, ' We can order a ban on imports of foreign products that violate U.S. corporate and private intellectual property rights (IP) '. ITC investigating unfair trade conduct sets a deadline for deciding within 45 days of setting up an investigative body. The industry says that American companies lagging behind Korean competition are taking full advantage of the Trump administration's protective trade strategy. Netlist filed a lawsuit with ITC and California Central District Court last September before winning Trump, accusing SK Hynix`s server memory of violating its patents, but ITC "" found recently to be a patent infringement. "" But the mood changed last month when Tesera, a U.S. semiconductor packaging system specialist, filed a patent infringement suit against Samsung Electronics Co. of Korea. Thesera argued Samsung Electronics ` Wafer-Level Packaging (WLP) technology violates two patents in the United States. WLP is a technology that cuts wafers per chip, simplifies packaging procedures, and produces semiconductor finished products directly at the wafer stage, unlike the existing method of packaging. The advantage of this is that it reduces the volume of finished products. Thesera filed a complaint with ITC to ban the import of violated Samsung Semiconductor Products that infringed on its patents, as well as embedded smartphones, tablets, laptops, and laptops, and immediately addressed Samsung's request for an electronic packaging ban. Local industry insiders say the plan is partly attributable to the view that Korea is more profitable than the United States. U.S. law firm Techanro's Koo Tae-eon said, "" The U.S. government and U.S. businesses are seeing Korean companies making as much money as they are doing in the ' super cycle ' of intellectual memory and are trying to get away with it. "" In fact, the Korea International Trade Association said, "" Exports to the U.S. increased by $ 45.93 billion (approximately 52 trillion won) from January to August this year, and imports by $ 34.48 billion (approximately 40 trillion won), respectively. Import growth was nine-fold greater than export growth. Among them, semiconductor imports increased significantly. Exports of integrated circuit semiconductors ($ 1.9 billion 940 million) and secondary memory units ($ 1.32 billion) increased by 67 % and 90 %, respectively, in conjunction with the memory semiconductor boom. However, semiconductor manufacturing credit costs ($ 35.58 billion), the largest among imports to the U.S., increased by a whopping 199 % from the previous year. In addition, imports of semiconductor-related products, including integrated circuit semiconductors ($ 2,457 million), were twice larger than those exported to the U.S. "" As the export of electronic finished goods or memory chips increases in Korea, the imports of U.S.-made machinery or equipment to manufacture them also has increased, "" a lawyer said. "" In an industry that is not considered unilateral. Despite the situation, the domestic industry is tense as ITC has pointed a microscope at Korea`s semiconductor-mine maker, Big 2. He did not know who would be next for the semiconductor. ITC had already prepared a recommendation to impose an emergency import restriction on washing machines from Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics last month. Prior to this, the committee also confirmed that Korean solar modules should be taxed. The Trump administration is only starting to attack the local industry now, and it is highly likely that it will continue its term, and companies that rely heavily on exports to the United States will have to diversify their policies to protect the economy.

"After North Korea's test fire with Hwasong-15, the U.S. government and North Korea have been making strong comments.Congress is even talking about preemptive strikes against North Korea, which is a background and meaning.I'll connect you with Washington correspondent. Correspondent Kim Hee-jun! First of all, the U.S. Congress gave us some strong words today. The rumor of a preemptive strike against North Korea has been remarked.[Republican] It's a hard-liners in the Republican Party.Senator Lindsey Graham has raised the possibility of a preemptive strike against North Korea.Speaking to CBS in an interview, Graham said North Korea's advanced missile technology is likely to make a preemptive strike on the North.The U.S. has no time for North Korea.He then argued that it was not normal to send an American spouse and children to Korea, and that it was time to move their families out of the country.It also said that if North Korea conducts a nuclear test, it needs to take serious action, and that it is time for Congress to hold an open debate on preemptive strikes against the North.Senator Graham even made a strong statement shortly after North Korea's missile attack on ICBMs, saying that if the situation does not change, it will go to war.[Anchor] White House National Security Adviser Herbert McMaster said earlier that the likelihood of war is rising every day.[Reporters] This was a remark made at a defense forum when it was answering a question from a Fox News anchor.National Security Adviser McMaster says North Korea's recent launch of an ICBMs is "" growing every day. ""He says North Korea's nuclear ambitions are the most serious security threat facing the United States, and that it is clear that its technology is improving every time North Korea launches a missile or performs a nuclear test.In another interview, McMaster called on South Korea, Japan and Taiwan to play a role of pressuring North Korea, saying it is possible that the threat of nuclear weapons might rise.U.S. Director of Intelligence Mike Pompeo also warned North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.Pompeo, director of the bureau, spoke out about North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, in a defense forum like his advisor, McMaster.Chairman Kim seemed not to know his plight at home and abroad.He also criticized the fact that people around him do not tell the truth about his unstable position in the world today.He also said he has a good understanding of the size and scope of North Korea's nuclear missile program and the level of development of its strike capability against the United States.Amid the strong comments by the U.S. government and Congress, the U.S. is considering the deployment of an advanced missile defense system, the THAAD system, to deal with the threat of North Korea's ICBMs.[Reporter] North Korea's preparation for ICBMs is reportedly being considered setting up a THAAD missiles defense system on the U.S. West Coast.Congressman Mike Rogers from the U.S. Senate Armed Forces Services Committee.Rogers says the agency is looking for a suitable location, and several sites are competing.But missile defense officials denied that they had been instructed to look for the THAAD site on the West Coast.The United States currently has seven other THAAD missiles in addition to South Korea and Guam, and plans to deploy 52 more launch pads to North Korea and other countries by September next year.Q : What do you think is the U.S. government's remark and Congress ' promise to act on North Korea?[a press] North Korea's recent icbm, Mars - 15 type that Trump president's remarks shortly after launch was a ""I will manage the situation we are"".They say they can not wait and see as long as North Korea's nuclear missiles threaten the United States and the world.But although some hard-liners, such as Graham, are making extreme statements about the possibility of war or a preemptive strike, it is unlikely that they will act immediately.The current U.S. stance on North Korea makes it clear that it will lead to changes in the North through diplomatic and economic sanctions and pressure rather than military action.The United States is speeding up its independent sanctions against North Korea as well as its unified sanctions against the United Nations and other international communities, and most importantly pressuring and urging China to play the role of North Korea.CIA Director Pompeo also stated clearly that rather than lead to military results, China's diplomatic and economic pressures would rather resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.McMaster also reiterated the two countries ' commitment to work, as North Korea's nuclear threat is a threat to China and Russia.In that sense, Trump, president and Secretary of State tilleoseun a visit by a North Korea made more harsh sanctions can be released this week, disrupting oil supplies, and also maritime interdiction.Is how tough action is to come out.Anchorwoman Kim Hee-jun, correspondent to Washington, has talked to us about the growing strength and impact in the U.S. since the North's launch of type 15 Mars.▶ Subscribing to YTN news channels on Naver. Collecting video news. Friend the YTN [Copyright holders : P) P.P.S. 10 % LOWER SAINT AND REdistributional SAINT PROPOSITION PROTION 1 ""] This is a response to the Bank of Korea's return to a quarter-percent increase in interest rates on July 30 for the first time in six and a half years. Compared to this, the interest rate of bank loans has decreased. If the interest rates on deposits go up and the rates on loans go down, it would be the best scenario for banks ' consumers. However, this trend is not likely to last long. According to a report by bank officials on July 3, Shinhan Bank will raise interest rates on its banks on July 4, and Kookmin Bank, Hana Bank, and National Agricultural Cooperative Federation will raise rates on deposits earlier this week. The increase was made by the banks of Shinhan and Hana, who gave 0.1 to 0.3 percentage points. Kookmin Bank and National Agricultural Cooperative Federation are also planning to decide on the size of their impressions and products to target. Lee Jeong-gwon, a reporter at Woori Bank, announced on July 1 that it would raise interest rates on deposits by 0.1 to 0.3 percentage points. The target is 18 installment savings accounts including Woori Wellich 100 travel savings deposits and deposits with temporary savings accounts with low cost. Interest rates on deposits charged to the prime minister rose from 1.8 % per annum to 2.1 %. New subscribers will be subject to higher rates after the first day, rather than the existing account. The online bank raised its year-and-budget rate by 0.15 to 0.2 percentage point from January 1 to January 2, to the "" year-end event. "" Regular deposits preferred by shareholders were raised from 2.2 percent per year to 2.4 percent, and the "" Plus K free savings account "" from 2.5 percent per year to 2.7 percent. It would be a good opportunity for customers to find a stable investment destination to protect depositors by 50 million won depending on the mood of interest rate hikes, said Ahn Hyo-jo, head of the bank`s operations. However, the event could be terminated earlier when the fixed deposit amount is 100 billion won and the free deposit amount reaches the limit of 10,000 people. Commercial banks saw their mortgage rates fall, however. According to each bank on July 3, mortgage rates on mixed housing (fixed for five years and variable interest rates) fell by 0.07 to 0.08 % compared with a week earlier. Kookmin Bank saw its annual rate fall by 0.15 % to 3.58 % compared with Jeonju (3.65 % to 4.85 %) and from 3.73 - 4.93 % in October. Mixed loan rates are set based on a five-year bond basis. The rate has been on the decline since the middle of last month. The central bank already saw its key interest rate hikes in October. Lee Joo-yeol, governor of the central bank, also said on July 30, I will make careful decisions on whether to further adjust the rate. Non-Mixed-Rate floating mortgage rates remain unchanged until July 15. The floating rate loans will be adjusted on the 16th of each month to reflect the COFIX (Financial Cost Index) rate announced on the 15th of each month. Therefore, the interest rate for deposit is higher than before, but the lending rate is lower than before. Unlike the rapid increase in lending rates along with the commercial rates, the deposit rates have remained intact. However, it is only a matter of time before lending rates are on the rise again, as interest rates are rising. Still, the market rate is forecast to continue to rise. Although the possibility of another rate increase is small by March next year, the long-term market rate will continue to grow slowly as consumer prices and economic indicators improve, said Kim Jin-pyung, economist at Samsung Futures Institute. Furthermore, as the interest rates for deposits and yearbooks rise en masse in December, the Copyx rate is bound to rise on January 15 next year. Copyx is calculated by aggregating bank financing costs, including e.g. installment savings, installment savings, and negotiable certificates of deposit (CD) rates. Among them, deposit money is the most important. If most banks raise their interest rates by 0.1 to 0.3 percent, Copyx is more likely to go up as well. Unlike the past when banks raised lending rates by raising the additional rate, it is hard to explain that the market rate is leading to a rise in lending rates, an official at the bank said. Therefore, if you need a loan, you'd better hurry. In addition, the fixed rate loan rate is between 0.4 and 0.5 percentage point higher than the floating rate. If the loan is more than 10 years old, a fixed rate plan should be considered for future rate hikes. Korean War journalist, Guyani Joongang.co.crk."
