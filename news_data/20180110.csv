That is why they say the Internet is slow to use when dealing with virtual money. I use a mobile app to check the exchange frequently, but now I try to change my cellular phone because it is dead, complained A, saying, It seems like I just look at smartphones all day. Investors who forgot about the night due to the boom in virtual currency investment are the only ones who are wealthy. One investor in a virtual currency Internet community wrote in an article titled "" The best thing to do with the currency is to get a neighbor on fire, and I called it in and caught it immediately. "" "" You're not going to save your life because you lost sleep. "" Another trader said, "" Corinne, who entered the cipher currency a week ago, was lucky enough to call it the Coin Market +, "" but he suddenly saw himself being stressed out and had to do with charts and community meetings all day.▽ Lotto, Virtual Counties … 〓 South Korea [Yonhap news source photo] Our society is suffering from a speculative frenzy in hopes of turning around its life. Lotto is becoming popular again, adding virtual currency to its current popularity, making people's dreams come true. Last year, Lotto sold by an average of 10.4 billion won per day, marking the highest selling rate ever. Lotto was in a ' wild wind ' for a while from 2002 to 2003 when it first debuted, but lost its popularity when its per game price was cut from 2,000 won to 1,000 won. However, with the sluggish economy, the annual sales of Lotto steadily rose after recovering 3 trillion won in 2014. As the price of virtual currency, such as Bitcone and Doodle, has soared in the short term, rumors of making a fortune here and there through the Internet and social networking services spread. Netizens were envied by the recent posting that they earned 54 billion won from investing in virtual currencies on an Internet community. The speculation frenzy is becoming more overheated as the virtual currency exchange is expanding and more virtual currency available for investment is also expanding. In particular, the so-called "" minuscule coine, "" or low-priced, is now trading, creating a growing number of bit-coint Zombies that only look at virtual currencies every day. According to a survey of office workers late last year by the job matching platform, 31.3 percent of the respondents were invested in virtual currency. They stated that ' the Internet community bulletin is frequently checked ' (39.7 % · multiple responses) or ' the concentration is poor ' (27.5 %) or ' the rate of return is highly dependent ' (22.4 %). As the negative effects of investing in virtual currency arise, banks are moving to block it. Earlier this month, the bank sent out an official notice to all of its branches banning virtual currency speculation. He thinks that one can invest in virtual currency as one of the financial institutions, but that one can lose money by going into speculation and therefore go into financial trouble. Other commercial banks, including Shinhan and Woori, were also prohibited from investing in virtual currency, saying they could lose interest in the bank's operations. We urge bank employees to refrain from reckless speculation to block the possibility, as financial accidents can occur if they lose money through speculative investment. People who are watching the virtual currency market [Yonhap news release] invest in virtual currency not only in the working class but also in the elderly. According to the app analyst firm Wise App, the most age group of Bitcone users was in their 20s (24.0 %) and 50s (15.8 %), respectively. Many college and job seekers who have relatively long time on their hands check the 24 hour app rates. The government has banned minors from investing in virtual currency, but teenagers who are still investing in the ' detour. ' A high school in Daejeon also told parents that "" Students at school recently tried to deal with virtual currencies using laptops and personal laptops provided by their school, "" and that they would send a message to parents to regulate virtual currency transactions. Shin Kwang-young, a sociology professor at JoongAng University, said, "" Now that people can reliably stay employed and expect income, the real estate speculation phenomenon has turned out to be a real estate speculation phenomenon, and people want to escape reality by making big money at one time. "" Professor Shin said, "" Students are unable to work properly until retirement. When they are not confident that they can work reliably until retirement, the issue of virtual money appears to be tempting. "" pseudojm@yna.co.kr"
"Lieutenant Lee Hyung-seok of Jeonju Deokjin Police Station, and the way to get a confession from her father and daughter from the victims ' relatives, and to forgive her daughter that she was a victim of the crime, she said, "" was the truth about the disappearance of her crime. Do you believe me?On July 28, around 10:00 p.m., when the "" missing 5-year-old Ko Jun-hee "" investigation was in full swing, a senior prosecutor (37) at Jeonju Deokjin Police Station asked Lee Hyung-seok, a senior prosecutor and a senior prosecutor were investigating himself. Then, she wrote down on a piece of paper asking whether she trusts her. Koh, who smoked a cigarette with the detective, began to talk. "" I buried Jun-hee, "" Ko's father's body is reenacted at a field inspection session in Naecho-dong, Gunsan, North Jeolla Province. [Yonhap news] Koh, who mistreated her daughter to death last April and stayed in the hills, was based on a tightly woven drama with her aunt (36), Lee's mother (62), and her mother, Kim (62). Soon after, Ko was immediately caught off guard and the investigation quickly caught on. The hero who removed Ko's disguise was detective Lee, a 22-year-old veteran who has persistently investigated him since the beginning of the investigation. Chief detective Jang Hyung-pil, who is known to have been involved in child abuse and abandonment cases by her father and daughter on April 12, reportedly died of a criminal homicide committed by her father, Jeon Hyung-seok. The investigation team learned that Jun-hee, who was suffering from thyroid problems, wore diapers when she used to. It was a loophole in the play that Ko had not yet dealt with and a result of public criticism of the sluggish investigation. Based on this, when questioning why he had not purchased diapers since April, Goh was caught off guard and began to shake. Koh acted as if her whole family was traveling on April 29, and cooked seaweed soup in time for her daughter's birthday on July 22. Police, firefighters and military units are searching for her at Ahjung Reservoir on the morning of July 18, 31 days after she disappeared from Jeonju, North Jeolla Province. Until then, Goyang had disappeared. The decisive clue was the birthday cake. It was a purchase that Ko intentionally left to disguise as if her daughter was alive. Koh stated, "" I bought a cake for my daughter and threw a party three days before her birthday, "" but the actual time of purchase was one day before her birthday. The answer was different from what Ko had prepared, who was already in a quandary over diapers. Asked by the detective, Ko began to talk out of turn, saying, ' I think my internal wife has bought another cake. ' He finally hung himself from a device he had set up to appear innocent. `` It's winter and it's getting colder, so let's stop bringing Jun-hee in, '' Koh said, completely collapsing.Koh's confession was necessary without witnesses, except for the suspects in the case. Ko Joon-hee's pro-parental department is in the middle of an on-site verification. Ko, who confessed to Kim Joon-hee's "" abandonment of the body, "" did not show a naked face immediately after taking off his mask. At first, the sick daughter had died independently of her, and she had to bury the body. The detective also obtained an endless confession in the process. To the witness who was at the center of the mystery, Koh said this time that the internal combustion woman, Lee, was not involved in the crime. Lee, Lee's mother, Kim, also gave the same answer as the scenario. "" If you find one, "" the detective said, "" the play continued based on the following scenario. "" Koh also admitted he planned to make a statement on the progress of the investigation in preparation for his crimes to be revealed, referring to the word ' second plan ' in police investigations. Chief Inspector Jang Hyung-pil of Jeonju Deokjin High School and second grade student Lee Hyeong-pil, who were found to have been involved in child abuse and abandonment cases caused by a biological father and daughter, were found to be two. The detective said, "" I couldn't get home properly and slept, but I couldn't tell you how hard it must have been for me to find the traces of Jun-hee, who was raising her children, "" adding, "" I felt much harder to the story. "" Ko Joon-hee's biological father is walking down the mountain after field tests. Previously, the detective had hoped the incident would have been a simple disappearance, as claimed by his father, Ko, and an insider. At least I could keep the hope that Jun-hee would be alive. So unlike other cases, this case is solved but can not get over the burden. However, it is fortunate that the bodies of the young woman, Jun-hee, who was buried in the cold hills for eight months, could be released. The detective said, "" It appears that Jun-hee died of abuse by her father and mother, but since it wasn't clear to the prosecution that the details of her case were not completely hidden, we didn't put the puzzle in place for her. "" We also could not have found Jun-hee even with her body without prosecutors who led the investigation, the blind and fellow violent team members, he said. Faced with numerous violent incidents, the detective specifically stated to Koh, whom he investigated nearly 10 times, that "" it is as Father that it is best to sincerely ask for forgiveness from her daughter, and that she has so many things to say to her, "" Jeonju = Kim Ho, reporter kimho @on gaongang.co. kr. .. ▶.

"[The Seoul Shinmun] Moon Jae-in, the president 10 days in Cheong Wa Dae as well as the journalists to New Year news conference.A smiling president - Moon Jae-in the president of the New Year which was held at Cheong Wa Dae yesterday at a news conference, smile at reporters with his hand to questions.to exist "" My goal with the government on New Year's Day through the New Year's message, titled ‘My life is getting better country’ is the president 2018.1.10 better and keep the ordinary lives of the people."" to make things he promised “the compass of people and demands of the people he can make changes in their life experience I will” high.After a 20-minute speech, the press conference proceeded freely. The president asks a question of the order and a select and answer a reporters, a news conference in a manner that is my hand, the president's questioner on the spot designated to.And the questions.Who was also the chairperson of the yunyeongchan presidential secretary for public communication said, the eye, hand as president he was last asked a reporter for the right. It is the first time to get confused. I have my eyes correct, "" adding, "" It is not good for you to get up unilaterally. "" Reporters at the scene burst out laughing.Next door an interview with the president -- his second year in office with opposition parties in order to realize the relationship is important, the bilateral meeting is going to do?Since the ruling camp is in the middle of a minority ruling party, it seems very important to communicate with the opposition through a narrow range of measures and seek cooperation for reform.In the New Year, I will do my best to maintain a level of sincerity while communicating and talking with the opposition parties.- What does it mean when I recently said, "" I will not pursue dialogue insidiously ""?As you can see in the video, we need to improve the relationship between the South and North as well as resolve the North Korean nuclear issue.These two things are not separate problems.Inter-Korean relations can improve only when the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved, and the two Koreas can solve the North Korean nuclear issue only when the relationship improves.The aim of sanctions and pressure is to bring North Korea into dialogue.Now, as a first step forward, conversation is not the only solution.We will work hard to improve inter-Korean relations by talking earnestly with North Korea, but the international community will impose strict sanctions and pressure if North Korea does not provoke or show sincerity again.The Korean government is also saying that it can not help but open its eyes to the possibility of using both sides.-- If you are planning a summit that is not easy, what are your goals, directions, and preconditions?If necessary to improve inter-Korean relations and resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, the two Koreas have a summit meeting and other meetings open.But talks for the talks can not be the target.I believe that the conditions must be established and certain achievements secured for the summit.If such conditions are met and expectations remain, we are willing to attend the summit anytime.-- The time has come when North Korea can threaten the U.S. directly. Whether it is an alternative, however, many Americans wonder how South Korea will position itself in the event of a conflict with the North. What is the president's thoughts on this.Although we are longtime allies of the United States and Korea, I think we share common interests in security. South Korea and the United States are under similar threat from North Korea's nuclear weapons and missiles.South Korea and the United States have been dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue with close coordination. As I mentioned earlier, he also made it clear that the ultimate goal of sanctions and pressure with the international community is to draw North Korea into dialogue and seek a diplomatic solution. It could be the effect of U.S.-led sanctions and pressures. Inter-Korean dialogue has begun. We will use the dialogue as an opportunity to improve inter-Korean relations and further develop it as an opportunity to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue. There is no difference at all with the United States. That is why the U.S. fully supports the latest round of inter-Korean talks and also expresses its hope to help resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. - Moon Jae-in president during his New Year news conference held in Cheong Wa Dae Monday morning are answering reporters ' questions.Yesterday, Yonhap News Agency -- Kang Kyung-hwa, Minister of Foreign Affairs, grannies processing is Japanese military sexual slavery agreement between Korea and Japan victims released by the president, I think it is not the result of a satisfactory level.Can you be satisfied.Can you be satisfied with a feed? Since it is a matter of confrontation, diplomatic troubles, and an official agreement between the two countries in the previous administration, it is important to find the best way in reality, even if we are not satisfied enough. I think the Lee administration has announced such a measure. If it is difficult to accept the existing agreement, one can ask why not break it and ask for renegotiation. But I'm Basically, the Japanese military sexual slavery problem is I think it can only be resolved by the principles of truth and righteousness.Japan and the truth, and victims testified about wholeheartedly apologize, and learn from it and I do not happen again.With the international community can forgive Japan, damage and able to work together, it was a complete it fix Japanese military sexual slavery. That is not the problem that the government should resolve by engaging the government in exchange of conditions and excluding the victims. It is wrong for the previous administration to seek to solve the problem by excluding the victims in that way. We urge principled approach to truth and righteousness of Japanese military sexual slavery issue in Japan. However, I do not think it can be solved by calling for renegotiation.-- Have you heard the word "" lipoclasis ""? The amendment alone does not solve all the problems caused by the centralization of the metropolitan area and the decline of the local population, but what direction should local decentralization take?Some doubt whether the local government has such capabilities when it comes to the policy direction of decentralization and enhancement of autonomy in the Gaepae region. I don't think so. I think local governments are well equipped, rather they fill the gaps in national politics.If local governments expand autonomy and control over finances, organizations, personnel, and welfare by taking up a small part of the administrative office, they can do many things closer to the residents. That is what develops the fat in a balanced way. Then, I believe that anyone can fundamentally block the road to becoming impoverished and co-operated in the Seoul metropolitan area, while containing the phenomenon of being driven to the capital.Second four-year term -- the president of constitutional amendment, there are a dual executive system, a parliamentary president is Do you prefer some form.In year I have personally U.S.-style two-term president since presidential elections is the desired it tell you that idea. I think it is the most supportive plan among the people. However, I do not intend to insist on my own belief. That is because it should be able to revise the Constitution.The revision should receive two-thirds of the National Assembly's approval and pass the referendum. So I think it is necessary for the National Assembly to find those minimum denominators that the people agree on and can support.I think decentralization is too natural and expanding the basic rights of the people is natural, even within the smallest denominator. How to revamp the central power structure is a very controversial point. If we can not agree on a single agreement, we should consider delaying the amendment to the next one. We will closely consult with the National Assembly on where to reach an agreement.Kim Yoo-min, reporter at planet@seoul.co.kr"
""" The Suwon District Public Prosecutors ' Office said, "" We found that one of the victims of the scandal was found to have been murdered by six women who were charged with cheating by the Kim family. Kim (age : 32, female), a family band member who used to rob women to get married, and her husband escaped from their lives with a family name of 50, 8, and 3. She wore a thin, short-sleeved clothing in the middle of winter, and bruises were found all over her body. Some of the wounds were being necrotic. "" How hard have you been living with the impostors, "" said A with a straight face to the crying mother, stroking her daughter's wounds. "" Mom. They are good people for my husband and his family. "" The prosecutor, who was watching them, said it was serious and asked Mr. A to be treated. Even during the investigation, A defended her husband's family, saying, All of them are good people. Prosecutors estimate that he suffers from Stockholm Syndrome. The hostages are seen as defending human beings. A prosecution logo In 1973, four armed robbers broke into a bank in Stockholm, Sweden, took employees hostage and confronted the police for six days, and the hostage was backed up by police. A family members who ran away after ripping off large sums of money from women were caught by the prosecution. They introduced themselves as a rich man and took her with them and abused them for being not enough to trick and steal victims. The criminal division of the Suwon District Prosecutors ' Office announced on July 10 that it indicted Kim and her husband, an aunt, on legal charges of aggravated economic crimes and other fraud. They are accused of taking 1.97 billion won (7.17 million U.S. dollars) out of marriage for six women in their 20s and 30s from January 2011 to July last year. According to the prosecution, the relationship between A and Kim began in January 2011. A private institute instructor was introduced to Kim's son, Park (29, aged among those who belonged to Gu). Park showed off her wealth by helping her do real estate projects. The two soon grew into a couple and had an interview with each other. Kim and Lee, who appeared at the meeting, described themselves as real estate agents and current police officers, saying, "" If you visit a house, I will treat you like a daughter. "" However, the reality of the two were con artists who sought out objects to make a favorable impression and asked for money on their wives ' weddings. In fact, the Park family asked the A`s for money to pay for her wedding. After marrying, he visited his parents and demanded money. The A`s family gave the three of them 1.3 billion won. As they continued to ask for money, the family of A felt suspicious and sued the Park family for fraud. However, after dropping the offer, Park ran away with his family. Since then, he has had a hard time. Park and others were forced to work in restaurants and carry him around the country and lived on the money. She said, "" I don't listen to you, "" and said, "" I hit you with my hands and feet, and swung a stick. "" Park, who runs a real estate business, was found to be a member of a violent organization in Daejeon. Lee, who was called a police officer, was also a stepfather and a former policeman. They have asked the women to marry them as if they were harmonious families and ask for money. At first, he suspected them, too. But her mother brai senoeashed her to obey her husband`s family, and her husband Park, who has lived like a benevolent orphan so far, finally gave up on you whom she loves. As Mr. A complied, they became more daring. Mr. A was included in their crime. They accused the victim of coming to their home of being in a big debt because she was a cousin. In May last year, Park also accompanied A to a wedding ceremony with another victim, B (28, female). As a result, he claimed, A is one with them. But A said, My husband and mother-in-law have children of different men. I thought it was because I have a part time job to do only at weddings, ' she said. Some of the women complained, but were acquitted after Park denied the accusations, "" It was a conflict while preparing for marriage. "" [Photo Pixabay] But the details were revealed last August when a broadcaster covered their criminal acts. Park later turned himself in for being acquitted as before, and was prosecuted for being involved in the scandal. When Park was caught and they were put on the wanted list, Kim and others assaulted him harshly, brandishing a blunt instrument, saying, My son was caught because of you. A, unable to endure the violence, escaped from the victims last month and contacted their family members when she thought they would die. However, even in the prosecution probe, A defended her husband and his in-laws by saying they are good people. Prosecutors persuaded Kim to catch Kim and Lee who were hiding in Goseong, Gangwon Province on July 19. Kim said he strongly protested the prosecutor's move by wielding a knife. In a prosecution investigation, Park said, I have ordered all of them, and my stepfather, Lee said, I knew it was the place to eat and I didn`t commit the crime. We believe he may have mistaken us for one family member who fell in Stockholm syndrome, and now that he and Park are the same family, prosecution officials say, I understand that Park's whereabouts is one of the family members in 2013. Choi is a reporter who asked for the return of the dead bodies at http://joongang.co.kr and JTBC Content, according to Facebook. The Seoul Central District Court's civil appeals division 9 (senior judge Choi Seok-moon) on July 10 dismissed the plaintiffs ' appeals in an appeal filed against the state against the prosecution.Park found Yoo's body while working in his plum garden on June 12, 2014. Park then reported that he was an unidentified speaker who died of alcoholism, as a result of severe decomposition and a bottle of alcohol around the body. Police in South Jeolla Province held a Compensation Committee for the arrest of the offender in September of the same year and could not report the prisoner's whereabouts as compensation because Park failed to report the incident to the investigating authorities.Park then filed a lawsuit against Yoo, saying, "" Even if we did not know the identity of the body at the time, we should get some of the compensation for the bodies since it was revealed that he was the chairman. "" The chairman did not specify that he would receive compensation only when he reported his name to the wanted leaflet. The court, however, refused to accept Park`s claim, saying that the act designated by the advertisement was to report Yoo Byeong-eon, a brief statement in the advertisement that was not problematic to recognize. Park never realized that the body was Yoo, said a former chairman of the presidential office, adding, We can not find any evidence that indicates that the body was later identified as Yoo, a separate report on the allegation against the body.Asd 12 @ bo View the news and photo on PyeongChang 2018. set up a news channel on Naver main!"

""" Declinining the Performance of the iPhone Act "" [Choi Ja-yoon and Jo Hae-in] Participation in the first lawsuit filed by the combined civic groups Apple and the first lawsuit filed by the Seoul citizens is the first case involving 150 people who will file a separate lawsuit against the prosecution. Civic Council for Consumer sovereignty in the United States and Apple Korea announced on July 10 that they will file a suit against the Seoul Central District Court against Apple headquarters and Apple Korea. The damages claim was estimated at 2.2 million won per person, including the average device price and alimony. There are 150 people who take part in the lawsuit. The court is expected to determine whether Apple's Update to Performance is meant to increase sales. Under Korean law, it is not very practical to determine whether the victim's damages were due to the criminal's intent or negligence. However, it is expected that Apple's decision will have a certain influence on the judgment as well as social criticism if it is proven to be reasonable. If Apple is recognized to have intentionally declined performance, claims could soar astronomical in countries with punitive damages, such as the United States. It is also important to note how the iPhone's poor performance proves that its users suffered material and mental harm. Consumers who use older models such as the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6Gb/s complain the updates are damaging the nation's money transfer failures, stopping applications, taking photos and stopping music.Data Apple released a statement on July 20, admitting that it introduced the feature to the iPhone 6, the iPhone 6Gb/s and the iPhone SE last year. On the same day, he said, "" I never intentionally shortened the life of my Apple product or lowered the user experience to encourage customers to upgrade, and I will never deny that. "" However, users point out that Apple's poor performance was a trick to increase sales of the new iPhone, citing the fact that Apple knew that the performance of the iPhone would be affected by the update. Korean consumers are likely to file a series of claims against Apple. The Council on Consumer's Sovereignty is set to file a first suit and then file a second suit. Separately, the number of people who want to participate in class action lawsuits at the law firm HannurI reached 352,394 as of Tuesday morning.

Nexon said Monday that it has accepted an application for an injunction asking China's court to suspend its copyright infringement and corruption of its unlicensed game Arad's rage. The 2D arcade game ' Dungeon & Piter ' was developed by Neople, a subsidiary of Nexon Korea. The game's trademark and copyright, as well as all other intellectual and intangible rights, are owned by Neople. Neople exclusively gave Tensent control over the services and operations of Dungeon and Fitters's PC games and mobile games in China. Nevertheless, illegal mobile games violating IP (Intellectual Property), such as stealing game materials of Dungeon & Pitur, are being developed and serviced in China. The Chinese court decides that ▲ Shanghai Jina Online Guard-Line, ▲ Shanghai Kingnet Online Guarand-Line, and Super-Computance, which provides similar games such as "" Arad's Rage, "" and immediately download the company ▲ Shanghai Kingnet Online. Chinese court says Neople has exclusively assigned PC game, mobile game service and management rights of Dungeon and Piter to Tenrasent, and "" The anger of Arrad Icons and their characters "" In particular, the key elements such as character, skill, and equipment attributes were highly similar to the setting of the dungeon and fighter, "" he said. Nexon Korea said earlier on November 22 last year that it had requested Tensent to take legal action concerning the distribution and service of similar games with dungeon and fighter, which are not legally licensed. Nexon said, "" game publishers suspected of violating the Dungeon & Fighter IP are ▲ Shanghai Kingnet Online Guangi Limited ▲ Shanghai Jina Online Limited ▲ Shanghai Yuhang YuhaI Online Limited ▲ Byeonggi GuagI Online. "" The five games suspected of violating the dungeon and Fighter IP are ▲ Arad's anger and _ Dungeon Alliance _ ▲ Dungeon Legend ▲ Dungeon's legend ▲ Dungeon and Gugeomsa's awakening. Nexon officials said, "" With this decision, Chinese courts will make the same judgment that ' The Dungeon and the Brave ', similar to Arad's, and ' The Dungeon Alliance, ' which is based on the Chinese version of ' The Golden Gate '. We will decide on the direction of response based on the reaction of the developers involved. 2papers@newsis.com> [Seoul Newspaper] sees an explosion of 20s to 30s who try to make a fortune and put all their eggs in virtual currency investment, including Bitcone, into the bargain. There were also a series of cases in which he threw off his job and jumped in. We made billions by investing tens of thousands of won in a bit coin, the statement said, turning them into bit-coined zombie. A virtual coin market is lit in front of the Korea Exchange (KOMSUNG) in Jung-gu, Seoul. As the price of Bitcone dropped 41 percent in a day on July 22, but surged 21.5 percent on July 23, many people are saying that people should be cautious about investing in the market. Park Yoon-seul, a journalist at Yoon-seul, said, "" The reason for this trend is structural problems in our society. Being in desperate need of a job, you can't afford to buy an apartment with the money you've saved all your life, or risk losing a gold spoon or a coin that you'll never beat, you know, the ones in your 20s or 30s, aren't going to make it.● As the economic polarization continues, some say that investing in virtual currency is the last channel for moving the class. A (30) who got ready to work started investing in virtual currency last year, and has been studying it for a while. Rather than sticking to the job market, which has failed many times, he or she is thinking of getting out of the job market by investing virtual currency. On July 9, A said, "" It is difficult for an average office worker to get a house in Seoul after saving a penny for 10 years, so it would not change his gloomy future. ""　Government regulations are not acceptable either. The current law does not have any basis for taxation, so the tax amount is 0 won even if you earn tens of billions of won. There are moves to introduce protection such as transaction real-name system, but financial authorities ' attempt to pull the virtual currency market into the regulatory framework appears to add to the turbulence. In addition, the fact that he made billions by investing in virtual currency has fueled the development of virtual currency.　B, a 30-something office worker who started investing in virtual currency at the end of last year, often checks his smartphone while on duty. We were told that her co-worker made a lot of money with her virtual bills, turned the car into a big car, and even raised money to buy an apartment in Gangnam. Friends nearby are also making money from millions to tens of millions of won, said the official, I think this is the only time we can change lives.　Recently, an online community posted an article on the Internet saying it earned 54 billion won from its virtual currency investment along with a capture photograph. The Internet user wrote one after another, saying, "" If I write a story down, I will send one million won each to 10 people. "" The account number was then followed by hundreds of comments asking to be shared, "" I live in a semi-basement hotel, "" and "" I have requested my own recovery. "" It is a ' hilarious ' (funny and sad) scene produced by the virtual money frenzy.　Non-named miscellaneous causes are constantly being promoted in collective chat rooms and Internet message boards designed to exchange information on virtual currency investment. Though the coins were not listed on the Korea Exchange, the temptation to invest only a small amount of money in Lotto is needed. It is very possible that it could fall or disappear in an instant, and it could become the target of fraudulent crimes.● Like games for young people … regulatory hourly wage earners at Kyungpook National University's sociology department Roh Jin-cheol said, As the younger generation is familiar with the Internet, it is not immune to say that virtual currency transactions are any different than games. As there are many side effects, such as causing obstacles to everyday life, regulatory measures should be set up, he added.Lee Jeong-su : Set the channel and challenge New Year's gifts!"

"Mazinga Z > Japanese animation and robot enthusiasts are astir after returning to the screen after 45 years That is because Mazinga Z is about to return to the big screen after his debut 45 years ago. The new movie, "" Mazinga, "" will open at theaters across Japan on Saturday (113) with the animated film "" Mazinga Z Infitini. "" Mazinga Z, a Japanese animation show that aired on Fuji TV in Japan from December 3, 1972 to September 1, 1974, was the only show to reach the highest ratings of over 30 %.In Korea, it was also very popular every Monday, following the Japanese show "" PappI, the prince of the universe "" in August 1975. Mazinga marks the 45th anniversary of the publication of its first TV series, and the current 50th anniversary of the cartoonist's debut (1967) of Nagaida High School. Here it is 10 years since the commonly used notation) and Mazinga Z's escape from the ambitions of evil scientist Dr. Hell and the surrendering world conquest of the empire.Koji is following in his footsteps (Kabuto Jujo) and his father (Kabuto Kenzo) as scientists. Among these, Cosey encounters an unidentified supermanent, Infiniti, and Lisa, a mysterious creature from the tomb near Mt. Fuji, and brings Dr. Hell and his device back together. Koji fights with Mazinga Z to save the Earth again.The original film, "" The Mazinga Z "", is based on the same characters, but has changed a lot over the past decade. According to the character introduction of the official website (www.mazinger-z.jp) Dr. Kabuto Shiro, the brother of Koji and fifth grade elementary school student, has grown into a unified platoon leader defending Earth.The sequel to the original film, TsurugI Tetsuya, female robot Venus A.'s pilot Honon and Coseborot, are also adapted to the stage as friends. Dr. Hell, of course, is back to the bad guys, including his men, Count Brocken, Baron Ashra and the machines they control. Of course, with the development of CG technology, the screen is more splendid. The machine numbers that Ma Jing-ga fights against are all made of a 3D CG.  Among the numerous Super Robot animations, Mazinga Z is particularly significant : it is the first humanoid robot to ride on a robot and pilot. Astro Boy (1952, Tezuka Osamu), an animated robot released before Z by Ma Jing-ga, was an Android 28 robot that the remote control operator operated with doctors.When NagaI was watching the cars in traffic, he said he had conceived the idea of a passenger-type robot, thinking "" I wish I could get out of my car and cross the road. "" He said he wanted to create robots that were totally different from Atom 28 and Ironman 28. One of the most significant things is that Koji, the main character of the movie, will actually act as the brain of a robot, riding on a vertical take-off and landing plane (initially a hoverfill, a jet file, and later a dock). In the early stages when Mazinga Z was still called Energer Z, the main character was set to dock on a motorcycle. The concept of a passenger robot is the backbone of many robot animation programs since then, and is the basis for the emergence of super-robot animations as a key part of the Japanese animation industry.NagaI High School, who turns 73 this year, is the father of Super Robot, and Mazinga Z is called the "" aid Super Robot. "" NagaI deserves the nickname "" Father of Super Robots "" and is the helper of the Mazinga series < Great Mazinga >, Katmajinga >, and the Sachinka and Shikata Robots.    [Culture industry meaning > mazinga Z is a very commercial animation. In the early 70s, just before Ma's appearance in Z, the high cost of producing animations tended to decrease in Japan. The high viewing rate of the first Super Robot Animation has led to a significant development in the character product market, including toys. ▽ Product Series = Super Earnest Dollars (1974) ; Jumbo Machines ' (1973) and Jumbo Machines (1973), Merchander Dozer's Confectionary (60 cm), have launched. The animation production practices led by toy companies are still ongoing. The popularity of animations led to the sale of records, and the theme song album of the time was a big hit selling about 700,000 copies. The new film is also preparing a number of related products, including "" Figure "" and "" Theme "" albums.The Japan Animation Industry Association announced last fall that it had recorded 2.09 trillion yen (about 20 trillion won) in the 2016 Japanese market, exceeding 2 trillion yen for the first time. It is equivalent to the next year`s budget of Gyeonggi Province, the nation's most populous metropolitan government. Among them, revenues earned outside of the country were 766.6 billion yen (approximately 7.3 trillion won), a 131.6 percent increase year-on-year. The sales of related products such as characters and characters amounted to 566.7 billion yen (approximately 5.4 trillion won), and those of related music items such as albums were 28.5 billion yen (approximately 270 billion won).

Earlier, Chairman Kim said, "" I could not attend the hearing because I could not communicate with you due to stress and hearing difficulties.

"The Embassy of the Republic of Korea in Morocco said on its embassy Web site that Moroccan Airlines does not hire any foreign flight attendants. ▽ Photo = Amid the cold wave of the job market in GalmurI, the Korean embassy in Morocco, the job market is frozen with job postings that are suspected to be fake. Moroccan Airlines Inc. is hiring Korean flight attendants, one company said. We need to register at our institute to get an interview, but authorities confirmed that we don`t have any Korean employees who can afford to go abroad. The Embassy of the Republic of Korea in Morocco said on July 10 on its Web site that Moroccan Airlines does not hire foreigners as its cabin crew. The company`s announcement of hiring Korean flight attendants was not even possible at the beginning. Even at the embassy, the company pointed out that the Korean Embassy in Jurwanda and Rwanda Airlines have recently filed "" fake recruitment ads. "" The company said last September, Rwanda Airlines hired 100 Korean flight attendants through our institute, but the admission was confirmed to have received tuition, fees, and agency costs, but the announcement was false. At least 150 people claim that they have lost money and their minds to job postings. One of them is victim A (26, female). A registered with Morocco to work for the company and received a final notice of acceptance. But for a moment, he was told that Rwanda, where the company was doing it, was a lie. The student spent about three months and 2.2 million won to get the final exam. The tuition fee that I registered for the company to get an interview was 1.5 million won, and I paid an additional 700,000 won including the cost of a non-ferential, proxy, and physical examination after I finally passed. "" `` I was shocked to hear that the CEO had to write a pledge that said, ' We don't ask Morocco Airlines directly for a job ' during the hiring process, '' he said. The Korean Embassy in Morocco confirmed, "" We have virtually no Morocco airline, "" but the CEO of the company said, "" We are still considering hiring. "" According to the messenger tipped off by victim B, K told the Moroccan flight takers that he would be in the quickest possible rush to get a ticket to Morocco, and he would go to Morocco by Air United Arab Emirates Airline and Air Morocco. Representative K is reportedly denying the scam by telling students to trust him or her, not hire fake ones. Victims who demand refunds such as the price of water and proxy fees are receiving a complaint from Seoul, Daegu and South Gyeongsang police stations, including the Suseo Police Station in southern Seoul, accusing them of hiring expat flight attendants. We will make clear the addresses of the companies and coordinate our tax cuts, the police said, We will start investigating the case as soon as we are set up our jurisdiction in the coming days. Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that K also introduced herself as the head of a private university in Korea. I thought, "" If you ask a private university to host an international beauty contest, you can ask me to pay you to promote your fellow foreigners, "" an official at the university said, "" I don't think you can actually ask me to go with you. "" Eventually, the university said, "" Because K did not bring any foreign participants, the company was excluded from the list of sponsors. "" ■ The nationwide police investigation team tried several times to contact the CEO of a company and the director to get an explanation on hiring Morocco Airlines and sponsoring a university beauty contest, but could not get through. Victims agree that the government should keep an eye on the outside world because it is unstable about hiring foreign companies. Victims C (26, female) said, "" If many foreign airlines have encouraged domestic flight attendants to hire Korean flight attendants, it would be good for us to do so, "" adding, "" We have been encouraged by overseas employers to hire Korean flight attendants.

It was quite different from the Cheong Wa Dae press conference that we have been hosting. And of course ask any questions directly the president nominates a way. Yoon Young-chan, the communication chief of the public, explained the new method before the news conference. Yoon, "" the president a press conference today and journalists freely and how to answer. There may be confusion in the process of calling the questioner. Finally, a reporter for the president has formally designate it as my hands and eyes given the right questions to her, and said, "" I as one-sided and difficult if you wake up that to snow.

The president is about 20 minutes from 10 a.m. announcement released a year with a government policies regarding for New Year message. This is the second time she has held a press conference since her inauguration on August 100 last year.Kim Min-jung (a20302@edaily.co.kr) Now, when you write a card abroad, you reduce the double fee to one kind. It is easy to check the confused results of the previous month. Also, the information on revolving payment (payment due) and installment payment should be strengthened.The Financial Supervisory Service announced on July 10 that it would revise the standard terms of loan-specialized financial institutions to protect consumer rights. We will resolve the irrational information asymmetry between card companies and consumers, and strengthen the purpose of the transaction, said Kim Tae-kyung, head of the watchdog agency.More than 130 billion won worth of credit card points have been destroyed each year since 2012, according to the FSS. Last year, as of the first half of the year, 66.9 billion won worth of stocks were lost. Though improvements were made such as paying taxes and allowing donations to be made with the points provided, many say that they do not appeal to consumers.The standard conditions shall be adjusted so that the consumers can cash in their accumulated card points on the credit card company's home page or application and find them on ATM. When canceling a card, pay your credit card by the credit card or pay it back with the money you want.Avoid international brand fees among the fees for overseas services. Now, the fee charged by Korean credit card companies (0.2 %) and the brand fee charged by international brands such as VISA and MASTER card (1.0 %) are double if they are scratched overseas.In the future, it is prescribed to charge only the fees for overseas services of Korean credit card companies, excluding brand fees. The fee-charge scheme is explained to consumers in detail.The revolving user shall notify the anticipated payment information via a bill. After a certain period of time, the terms and conditions shall specify the fact so that the credit card company can notify the customer. Revolving cards may have the advantage of preventing late payment of the card, but the higher the rate of interest is, the higher the burden of paying the card. However, if the payment is not made in full after the revolving payment is made, the customers will not know the revolving payment characteristics well enough to continue without knowing the revolving payment.■ News 1 : As a Bang Eun-young designer, a guide to the results of the previous month, which is considered to be a hindrance in using credit card services and benefits, is strengthened. Now the calculation is complicated with different periods of service charge from the previous month's performance assessment institutions, and with no immediate inclusion of installment or tax or utilities in the previous month's performance. It is required to check the performance of the previous month with the website, app, and bill at the beginning of each month, and to notify the possibility of adding up the results of the month.If the loss of a time benefit due to a loan is expected or confirmed, the terms and conditions shall reflect this fact to be communicated to both the collateral provider and the joint surety. The clauses concerning the obligation to provide information on the right to withdraw and protest installment transactions and to ask for a cut in interest rates, should be included in the act.In addition, the Commission improved the practice of unilaterally placing responsibilities on consumers to prove their cases in the event of an accident involving credit card use, modulation or hacking, and further discussed with the industry the reasons for consumers ’ ‘ intentional and intermediate ’. Expansion to information in any such changes, dormant card automatic termination of criteria to six months, etc., extension amendment details and terms of the revised to reflect the director of the Financial Services Commission regulation.FSS is scheduled to finalize the revision standard terms and conditions in the first quarter of this year after consulting with the credit and financial institutions. The specific time of implementation may vary for each issue. By improving irrational business practices for card consumers, we will increase consumer convenience and the credit card industry will also be able to boost people`s trust, said Kim Tae-kyung, director of the credit card industry."

The suffering of crocodiles is of course affected by the recent cold wave hitting the U.S. continent, but another interesting secret is hidden in the picture.Surprisingly, the crocodile is not verbal but alive. "" I don't believe it, but the crocodile in the picture is still alive and well, "" Park said, explaining that when the pond froze in freezing weather, it looked like it was frozen dead. "" When it gets warm again, the crocodile controls its body temperature as if nothing had happened, "" he added.This behavior of the crocodile is hibernation. As is well known, some mammals, including bears, hibernate after being stuffed to the full during the fall. The same is true of reptiles, which is a poikilothermal whose body temperature changes depending on its ambient temperature unlike mammals. But while bears hibernate lightly, crocodiles spend the winter almost died until the weather warms up. Park Jong-ik, reporter of the Seoul Times, pji@seoul.co.kr / Photo : "" If you leave the news section, people say, ' Why are security guards not here? ' and they say, ' How can you rest at an apartment complex in Seoul? ' (Chung's office) on the afternoon of July 9. It was to bring the courier to the security office when they arrived at the right time. Coincidentally, Chung was taking a break during recess. The break is not keeping well, but Chung is hopeful that his salary will be raised. The media reported that the minimum wage for this year is expected to rise by 16.8 percent from last year's. However, when Jeong heard a notice from the management office recently, he gave up his expectations. It means that it is difficult to meet the minimum wage, so they will increase the resting time by one or two hours, leaving the wage of only 1.4 million won per month. According to the report, other apartment guards in Seoul were in the same situation. Everywhere, Commersot tried to avoid raising her minimum wage under the pretense of increasing her less-guaranteed rest time. G Apartment in Sadang-dong, Seoul, increased the resting time of guards by two hours starting January of this year, and the apartment building in Dangsan-dong P, 583, increased the break time by three hours. Usually, security guards who work every other day work around 14 hours. Five hours out of the remaining 10 hours are bedtime, and five hours of rest. Assuming that they work 210 hours a month, the monthly wage should be at least 1.58 million won (based on the minimum wage this year). The recess is divided into one hour and 45 minutes for lunch, one hour and 45 minutes for dinner, and one hour and half before bed. It is difficult to make a complete rest even if you adjust the hours of work and rest. A security guard cleans an apartment complex in Yangcheon-gu, Seoul yesterday. ▽ Photo = News1 guards say in unison, "" It is only recess, but working hours without pay are actually being forced. "" In addition, residents can not get a good rest by knocking on doors to find the delivery service frequently, as there is no place to rest, Jeong said. An apartment guard, Lee (65), also said, I should run when I receive a complaint at 1:00 a.m., even though I slept at night. It is frustrating because even management offices can not afford to be sharp. It is burdensome to pass on the wage hikes of tens of millions of won a year as a result of the minimum wage increase to administrative costs. "" I recently extended the guards ' resting time by half an hour to reduce costs due to a rise in minimum wage, "" said an apartment manager in Dongdaemun district. "" From a point of view of management, the residents ' resistance suddenly rose. "" Experts agree that it is not right to avoid the burden of minimum wage hikes by increasing the amount of time off, and that it is necessary to improve the actual treatment. The court case sees the recess under the command of the operator as working hours, said Kwon Hyuk, a professor at the Law School at Busan National University, noting that the expediency to circumvent the minimum wage hikes is not healthy. Labor unions designated by Lee Hwang-gu should also be guaranteed to make sufficient use of their free time, saying, It is not easy to engage in unfair treatment, but they should receive strict advice on how to deal with the problem over the long term.

"▽ Possible abuse of money due to easy concealment of criminal profits…House of the seminar, the virtual currency discussion on tracking methods and how to confiscate [Yonhap news] (Yonhap news) [Yonhap news agency], Im Soon-hyun (Yonhap news agency) said, "" Prosecutors will prepare encrypted virtual currency such as Bit-coin for criminal investigation. "" The Supreme Public Prosecutors ` Office said Monday that the Cyber Crime Study Association under the Supreme Public Prosecutors ` Office is scheduled to hold a seminar on Bitcone Technology Overview and its utilization status to discuss criminal cases involving virtual currency. The seminar will discuss ways to trace virtual currency, and confiscate and collect it in depth, especially in criminal cases involving the profit from virtual currency. As it has the advantage of being easy to hide when used as a criminal profit, criminals prefer it, and the possibility of tracing virtual currency with regard to the investigation is discussed here. Prosecutors will also discuss ways to respond to the court's recent ruling that the seizure of Bitcone, a well-known virtual currency, is unacceptable. The court ruled earlier last September that Bitcone, unlike cash, is not a physically internalized file and should not be confiscated. However, the prosecution appealed, saying, "" It is hard to accept this. "" Although the court originally planned to pass the second trial on July 9, the court postponed the decision until July 30, citing the need for more in-depth examination of related legal principles. We will prepare a technical analysis that says virtual currency should be considered as a criminal profit by stepping up research on ways to deal with virtual currency crimes through seminars, prosecution officials said. The prosecution is planning to support the prosecution's investigation into crimes using virtual currency by organizing the discussion at the seminar, and review the measures to utilize the money actively in future investigations and trials. In particular, it has become difficult to find good jobs as the youth unemployment rate has risen to an all-time high and the number of manufacturing workers has increased. As the number of employed people in the food and lodging industry decreased significantly last month, some say the effect of the minimum wage hikes has become serious. According to the December 2017 employment trend announced by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on July 10, the number of employed last year rose 317,000 to 265,000 from the previous year. The annual number of employed people increased significantly from 299,000 in 2016, but fell to 337,000 in 2015 and 533,000 in 2014. The annual number of unemployed stood at 108,000 last year, the highest since the country began statistical work on the same basis in 2000. Unemployment in 2016 was 101,200. The National Statistical Office found that the number of jobless dropped in their 20s, 24 and 50s, but increased from those over 60 to those in their 20s and 29 and 30s. The number of manufacturing jobs that were found to have been relatively good was 4.46 million, or 12,000 (0.3 percent) less than the previous year, and the reduction was even greater than last year's (5,000). Employment in wholesale and retail businesses grew at an increasing rate, construction businesses saw an increase in the number of employees (6.2 %), and construction businesses saw an increase in the number of employees in the health and social services industries (3.3 %) as well. Last year, the number of self-employed people rose 72,000 (1.3 percent) from the previous year to 562,000, while the number of unpaid family workers decreased to 15,000 (1.4 percent).Job seekers look at the recruitment boards at the 2017 Seoul Global Company Career Fair at Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) in Seoul on November 10, 2017. [Yonhap] Last year, the youth employment market was especially bad. The jobless rate among young people (ages 15-29) last year was 9.9 %, the highest since the current standard was measured in 2000. The jobless rate for the young class stood at 435,000, the same as in 2016, the highest level since the standards were revised in 2000. The employment support index 3, which shows the jobless rate at the age of 15 or older, rose by 0.4 percentage points and by 0.7 percentage points to 11.1 percent for the younger generation and 22.7 percent for the younger generation. Although the employment statistics division of Statistics Korea Bin Hyun-jun is in a bad shape these days, we still received applications from additional civil servants in November and had local civil service officials test in December. So, it is believed that the current job seekers have moved on to the jobless, especially in their 20s and young. The overall unemployment rate was 3.7 percent, the same as in 2016. The economically inactive population stood at 617,000 last year, up 2,000 from a year earlier. Private view was decreased from childcare (- 7.0 %), attendance and class (- 1.9 %), and mental and physical disabilities (- 3.4 %), but increased from rest (6.5 %) and from fuel (3.4 %). The number of job seekers who gave up on the job market stood at 483,000, an increase of 36,000 from 2016. Employment rose by 0.3%p to 60.7 percent from the previous year. The OECD comparison standard of 15-64 years of employment stood at 66.6 percent, up by 0.5 percentage point from the previous year, the highest ever. Last December, the number of employed people rose 253,000 from a year earlier to 246,000. It is the third month since October last year when the government target of 300 thousand more workers per month. It is the first time that the increase in the work force remained in the 200,000 range for three months in a row since the lengthy period of the financial crisis in August 2007 to March 2010. Public administration, defense and social security administration increased by 81,000 (8.3 percent) and manufacturing industries increased by 88,000 (2.0 percent). In contrast, the number of restaurants and accommodation businesses (- 49,000 · 2.1 %) and education and service businesses (- 25,000-1.3 %) decreased. The decline in accommodation and restaurants business is the biggest since a reduction of 71,000 in May 2011. According to the NSO, expanding the reduction in the number of restaurants and accommodation businesses is a fundamental influence on the cumulative decline of tourists last year and the increase in the number of tourists a year ago. However, some analysts say that the fact that the job insecurity started in the face of the minimum wage hikes has affected the nation. Indeed, the number of daily workers in the accommodation and restaurants sector decreased by 49,000 from a year earlier, the biggest decline since September 2016. We should be more specific to see whether the wage increase affected the number of people employed in the accommodation and food industry or reduced the number of working days, said Bin Hyun-jun, director of the ministry. Employment was 60.2 % last December, and the employment rate was 66.5 % of those aged 15-64. Unemployment rose 68,000 people to 915,000 due to the restructuring effects of some regions, and the jobless rate rose 0.1 percent to 3.3 percent. Unemployment among youths rose 0.8 percent to 9.2 percent from a year earlier, the highest since December 1999 when it hit a record of 103 percent. Government analysis shows that the influx of job seekers from local civil service exams and the ongoing contraction of employment is likely to have an effect on the nation's workforce. The jobless rate stood at 21.6 percent for the younger generation. The job market is likely to worsen as the job market is expected to start hiring young people in the first quarter, and we will strengthen the job market and provide job security support to support them, a government official said.Participants are interviewed at the 2017 Global Trade Workers Recruitment Fair in COEX, Samseong-dong, Seoul, on December 1, 2017.

Starting July 18, the new ' Second Passenger Terminal ' will be opened at Incheon Airport. Depending on the airline, existing first and second passenger terminals shall be used separately. Since the airport expects 770 passengers to experience confusion on average a day, it is advisable to know the relevant information in advance. In particular, if you visit a terminal incorrectly, you can spend at least 15 to 30 minutes. The Dong-A Ilbo asked the questions concerning the second terminal for passengers at Incheon International Airport in a question-and-answer form. Q.

Airport railways and KTX are extended from July 13 to the second passenger terminal. It is the next stop after the second passenger terminal. 103 airport buses, including the route bus and limousine bus, will also be extended to the second terminal.Most buses, like the airport railways, go to the second terminal via the first terminal. However, it is advised to check the other eight routes, including Korean Air and Limousine, before using the bus because they stop at the second terminal. Q. What should I do if I visit the terminal incorrectly?A. You can use the shuttle bus or airport railway that connects the first and second passenger terminals. For a free shuttle bus, go to Gate 8 on the third floor of the first passenger terminal to get to the bus stop. Although the initial schedule was to run every five minutes, the exact interval between buses is currently being adjusted. You can check the location of the passengers and the interval between buses at the Incheon Airport's homepage from the 11th to the 12th. If you need to get to the terminal on the first floor after getting off at the wrong terminal, you can take a shuttle bus at the bus stop between Exit 4 and 5 on the third floor. Q. What duty-free shops are available for use at the second passenger terminal?A. Lotte Duty Free Shop, Shilla Duty Free, Shinsegae Duty Free, FM Duty Free, City Duty Free and Entas Duty Free will open on July 18.

Lotte Duty Free Shop sells liquor and cigarettes, Shilla Duty Free Shop sells cosmetics and perfume, and Shinsegae Duty Free Shop sells fashion and general merchandise. It is estimated that duty-free shop businesses will have no difficulty in shopping as they attract various brands. Shinsegae Duty Free Shop held Chanel branch in the second terminal after withdrawing from Incheon Airport in 2015. The brands held at the second passenger terminal can be found at each duty free shop's homepage, etc. Q. Where can I park?A.

According to prosecutors, Kim and her son Park had to date A (26, female) in January 2011 and live together without a marriage registration that year. The Kims began charging A parents for large sums of money during their wedding preparation and took 1.3 billion won until last year on the grounds that it is necessary to do business. The number of women who were subjected to this trick was six, including Mr. A. Kim and others received 1.197 billion won from those in their 20s and 30s through July last year. In the process, Park faked her entire career, age, and wealth, making herself a doctor, businessman, and one of the gang members in Daejeon. Kim and Lee went around looking for the target of the crime, and made a good impression that they were happy families and asked for money when women decided to marry. When the Kims decided that they could no longer obtain money from the victims, they went into hiding and prepared for the next crime. The victims sued, but some of them were acquitted after Park denied the accusations, saying it was "" a conflict during the wedding preparation. "" Their crimes were revealed last August when Park turned himself in as he started to report on SBS TV's indictment program, "" I want to know about it. "" Park turned himself in for one more case, but the prosecution confirmed other damages by conducting further investigations and appointed Kim and Lee who escaped after arresting them. After being robbed of more than 1 billion won, he ran away with Kim and others, but could not endure the abuse and managed to escape from them on July 9. It was found that Kim repeatedly beat the victim to make money. Prosecutors persuaded A not to realize his defamation until then, and arrested Kim and Yi in Goseong, Gangwon Province on July 19. A was under the delusion that she was the most vulnerable to charges of being a member of the Kim family, including the Stockholomm syndrome, in which hostages are assimilated with offenders, prosecutors said. zorba@yna.co.kr"

"■ News 1 : Choi Jin-mo, a South Korean designer, arrested and arrested Chinese citizens using 25.46 billion cases of personal information, and used the secret service phone number of 500 million people to steal information from servers. The Cyber Investigation Department of the National Police Agency announced on July 10 that it arrested a Chinese man (27) on charges of violating an information network, using a computer, and attempting to be indiscreet, and is investigating a Korean accomplice. According to police, they conducted 126,467 Altuls site members operated by East Soft at their workshop in Qingdao, China from February 9 to September 25 last year, including the personal identification number of 127,247,000. They learned that members using East Thorpe's Altles Service, which provides integrated ID and password management services, will automatically save the ID and password of several sites, including portal sites. Based on the program, the user could randomly enter the ID and password he or she had obtained through various channels, and when they found the ID and password that allowed them to log in, they were stolen one by one. A and others revealed 430,000 identities and passwords stolen through EastSoft from September 1 to 8 last year, and said, "" If you don't give members the personal information that they have exposed, they have to be revealed 500 million won in cash. "" It was also revealed that the two were even producing press releases with the same content and threatened EastSoft 67 times using phone calls and e-mails. When EastSoft did not respond to the threat, they used their passwords and passwords to access portal sites. In the process, the members secured resident registration and credit card photos that their personal information was stored in the cloud, opened their mobile phones in the names of the victim B, and used the five computer servers to commit crimes. Their use of the cloud refers to the cyberspace that makes data available anytime, anywhere when they are connected to the Internet after storing it on a central computer with Internet connection. The two even got additional personal information stored in the cloud by identifying the cloud access ID and password. They have also made it useless to strengthen the authentication process using mobile text messages and OTP (one-time passwords). According to police, A and others used spam protection services and cell phone calls from victims to prevent text messages calling for their authentication from being transmitted to their victims ' phones. The OTP authentication device allows victims to set the same OTP on their mobile phones by stealing the victims ` stored initial setup codes, police explained. Using the personal information obtained by the same method, A and others went to the virtual currency exchange, such as Bitcone, and took some of the coins (worth 8 million won) owned by the victims. According to police investigation, the two women, who used to make money from the gap between the countries of encrypted currency such as Bitcone, have purchased and sold the coins in China. When the police revealed the crime, they began an investigation and arrested him at Incheon International Airport last month. Police said, "" 25 million personal information leaked is believed to have been used as passwords and identities to access certain websites. "" On average, each victim received 150 individual access accounts as a result of receiving a different ID and passwords. Police, in collaboration with EastSoft and the Korea Communications Commission, ask members whose personal information was leaked to avoid further victims and to change their passwords to those who did not have their personal information leaked. Police also encouraged Internet websites to strengthen their security so that they could detect attacks by leaking passwords and IDs to their operators. Internet users should be careful not to automatically store pictures with sensitive information, such as ID and credit cards, on portal websites to prevent similar damages, police said. Cyber-territorial Investigation Team at the southern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency investigating the incident is investigating a margin counselor (suspected of having engaged in gambling opening) who provided gambling opportunities through margin transactions on July 10. Most of the members who were surveyed said they did not know whether it was illegal because of the services provided by the exchange. Police, however, say the crime could be established even if there was no recognition of the injustice. However, it is still reviewing the law to punish actual members with criminal intent. Members claim that they had not recognized the irregularity in the margin transaction at all, and because the bill itself has not been ratified, some say it is too much to punish the members. A recent indemnitor said, Frankly speaking, I feel bitter. Meanwhile, police will punish those involved in the gambling business for opening the gambling house, and will investigate the disadvantage of the gambling opening if the members who played the role are not punished. We have to consult with the prosecutors as well as the team before we can sort out any offenders, a police official said. Usually, the police set a schedule by the number of gamblers or the amount of betting money, and then cover those who entered the case. Coine officially stated on the same day that the transaction can not be considered as a gamble and said, We will not allow any of the members who were asked to appear on the witness list to take advantage of the disadvantage of the lawyer. goals@yna.co.kr and inquiry, 1:1 chatting with reporters on July 9, 2018 China Robot, a Chinese company developed by LG Electronics, and even copied airline robots to open its robotics business in Las Vegas.

It is also being sold through some local distribution channels. It also supports Hangeul Service, which is said to have collaborated with Hancom.Korean robot makers are also unhappy to see Chinese companies take off after taking control of the exhibition. Some Chinese robot distributors are increasingly copying Korean products and entering the robot business themselves, and there is no way to deal with the problem of technology theft.High-in-President Robotiz said, "" Some Chinese companies have entered CES as entertainment robots, and some of them have copied over their patents as distributors of our robotics products.
