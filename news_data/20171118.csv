"A poor drinker starts getting nervous when the year ends. Because there are many drinking parties such as dinner table and alumni meeting. A little drink makes me flushed, and I have had a terrible hangover and suffered more than once. Whenever other people offer alcohol, Mr. A says, "" I don't drink much "" and tries to avoid it, but the return answer is always the same.Do I really drink a lot and do I get to drink more and drink better? Today SBS Life interviewed Jang Eun-sun, a professor of digestive medicine at Seoul National University Hospital in Bundang to check whether the myths about drinking alcohol were real.■ Not enough alcohol? Lack of acetaldehyde breakdown enzyme!The main components of alcohol are water and ethanol. Ethanol absorbed in the stomach and small intestine is broken down by ADH (alcohol dehydratase) in the body's detoxifying organs and becomes acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is then broken down into acetic acid and water by AL DH (acetaldehyde breakdown enzyme) and released into urine.In general, the term ' less alcohol ' is used for people who get red in the face or feel nauseous after a small drink. This happens when acetaldehyde, which is 10 to 30 times more toxic than alcohol, is left in the body without decomposition. Ultimately, alcohol consumption is determined by the amount of al AL, an acetaldehyde decomposse.But alcohol is not an activating enzyme, because it's too heavy. Moreover, there is a research result that Korean people are genetically deficient in AL DH enzymes. Chang Eun-seon, a digestive medicine professor at Bundang Seoul National University Hospital explained, Korean people reported that around 14.5 percent have almost no AL DHs genetically, and about 50 percent of the population has no AL DH.■ "" The more you drink, the more you can drink "", is that sound enough?So is it completely groundless, saying "" The more you drink, the more you drink ""? Experts explain that the way you dissolve alcohol may affect your drinking. There are three main ways that the body dissolves alcohol. When alcohol enters the body, it is broken down mostly with AL DH enzyme.If you drink too much and the concentration of alcohol in your body remains high, the liver will activate the enzyme Microsomoal ethanol oxidation (MEOS). And our body tries to break down the alcohol with an enzyme called peroxisome catalase. These enzymes are normally not involved in alcohol breakdown and become active the more you drink.But the effects of these two enzymes are marginal. Because ALVDA takes up more than 80 % alcohol breakdown. "" You may feel drunk because the MEOS enzyme is activated, but it is only a temporary effect because 10 % of the time it actually involves alcohol metabolism, "" Chang told SBS.■ "" I've become really good drinker. "" … alcohol resistance helped you drink more alcohol?Some say, ' You're not drunk because you're a little sober, ' but that's also groundless, experts say. Alcohol tolerance can increase the amount and frequency of alcohol consumption, but it is irrelevant that the enzymes that break down alcohol are activated to improve the ability to process alcohol.Professor Chang says, "" Drinking too much has become resistant, and it is not the medical fact that it has become more expensive, "" adding, "" The days when I feel like I am drinking well are not the same as the day I was. ""■ Even though you can't drink more, keep healthy when you drink!Experts say the most important thing to stay healthy when drinking is not to drink too much. It's also a good idea to have a meal before drinking. It is because if you drink while empty, the alcohol concentration is twice as high as usual. Drinking water is also helpful. Drinking water frequently during drinking can reduce the amount of alcohol consumed and also encourage the breakdown of alcohol.Army fire training Lee was indicted on charges of insulting an instructor, Captain Kim (37), while serving as an Army private first class officer in May. Lee was then informed to stand upright by Lt. Gen. Kim, who was on the firing range control tower. "" Can I scream, boss? "" Lee replied aloud. When Captain Kim ordered him to leave the shooting range, he said, I am still with the other soldiers and threw his bulletproof helmet hard on the floor. Military criminal law mandates that a superior be sentenced to no more than two years in jail or in a safe if he or she insults him or her face. Judge Kim pointed out, "" What Lee did at the time could be regarded as disrespectful to his superiors and improper behavior. "" However, it was judged that social evaluation of the personality value of one's superior, who constitutes an insult offense, can not be seen as a degrading action. He concluded that it was hard to say that he meant to insult his superior because he threw a bullet proof helmet as he went down the shooting range, not before his instructor. seaman@yna.co.kr • Report and inquiry (click!) ▶ Starbucks Coffee shot at 400 minutes of Yonhap News Channel. Pohang Earthquake Safety Certification Building, Central News Agency's Central News Agency reported no real gold in its 3-story, story-like report on the construction site. "" The center is located about 6.6 kilometers from the epicenter of the Pohang earthquake that hit on July 15. It is 3.6km away from the damage caused by the collapse of the building's outer walls. The entrance was damaged, but there was no sign of an earthquake inside the welfare center. There were only two real gold cracks in two places throughout the three-story building. A nurse who was inside the welfare center when the earthquake hit, said, As I was shaking, I felt an earthquake hit. But I did not know it was such a big earthquake because the books on the bookcase did not fall out. `` I was surprised to see the damage that was seen later on in the news, '' he added. The exterior of the welfare center has a yellow mark with the words "" earthquake-proof building "" on it. It means that the entire building was earthquake-proof, so the government certified the safety of the public building. Though not an expert, it certainly did little harm, said Kim Young-kook, director of the office. It is a big difference from the cracks in my nearby studio wall. As we do, the twisted floor near the entrance to the welfare center shows the boundary of the earthquake-proof design. The tiles outside the perimeter were broken, and the ones inside were not broken, "" explained Cho. Other buildings near the community center were badly damaged. The exterior walls of the apartment were cracked and the pillars of the first floor of the studio were bent. A resident who was passing by said, There was a big commotion as a water tank exploded in the studio. We are in a very difficult situation right now. Poeun Central Library in Buk-gu, Pohang City is also one of the buildings certified for earthquake stability. The library, 7.6 kilometers from the quake's epicenter, was also damaged. The toilet tiles were broken, and several walls were cracked. However, the damage was slight compared to nearby homes where the walls had collapsed. Pohang Police Station in northern Pohang, 190 meters away from the library, has collapsed its roof and police officers are blocking access to the area. Hwang Yong-jun (75), who lives right next door to the library, said, The house was shaken and the wall was broken. The wall was covered with an electric wire, and 119 firefighters put it down, claiming it was dangerous. Jun Geum-soon (62), who lives next door, said, The bedroom door has twisted, not closed, and the ceiling is cracked. The ‘ Seismic Stability of Public Buildings ’ system was adopted by the government in November 2013. As the public opinion grew that "" Korea is not safe from earthquakes, "" the Ministry of Public Administration and Security (then National Safety) decided to notify the public of the designation of public buildings safe from earthquakes. If local governments submit a performance statement that says their public buildings are well earthquake-proof, the government is deciding whether or not to authorize them by applying anti-seismic criteria. Ministry officials said, "" The criteria we are using for this certification are about the average of the anti-seismic design standards that the industry is recommending for newly built buildings. Although anti-seismic designs are important, we carefully check whether they were well built as they were. About 1,600 buildings have been certified nationwide. Eight of them are in Pohang. The welfare center for the North disabled is the closest among the eight buildings to the quake's epicenter. The government is set to expand the certification to private buildings next October. As it has not been long since it was implemented, and local governments have applied for it, many citizens don`t know about the system. I expect private structures to become more interested when they can receive the certification from next October, the official said.

"The ` Money Without tags ` by the National Intelligence Service (NIS) special activity group is shaking the nation once again. The epicenter is the mouth of Lee Heon-soo, 64, former director of planning and coordination at the National Intelligence Service. Matters went from bad to worse when prosecutors were ‘Cheong Wa Dae, Park Geun-hye’ at the end of his “50,000 won a wad of cash bag delivered in the black James Bond.” is being bombarded with carpet bombing. The door handle power, as Park Geun-hye, former president is under investigation on the list again and trial events nongdan anbonggeun ijaeman the former secretary is under arrest. After going up for investigations on joyunseon Hyun Gi-hwan, the former president, the then presidential again when Gen. Nam Jae-joon ibyeonggi ibyeongho investigation at the same time, wreaking havoc for the right of the former NIS chiefs. Prosecutors investigating the NIS said that the money now of the pro-Park Geun-hye faction over the top of the table, Rep. Choi Kyoung-hwan of the world of (chinbakkeunhye) at a political circles. The Special Part 3 (The yangseokjjo) of the so-called ‘white lists events’ (Park Geun-hye, executive director of the Seoul District Public Prosecutor's Office in September this year the government pressing for support to the conservative groups in large companies.Case) received a full investigation since the investigation. Prosecutors previously secured a full account of the amount of money the ministry's budget office sent to Lee with huge sums of money to cover the special activities. For example, the amount of money given to the chief of a company was distributed to the employees on October ○, the year of the petition. Normally, such records can not be handed over to the investigating agencies, but this time, the NIS operates its own "" Intimidation-clearing task force, "" and therefore, all of the staff's statements and records were delivered to the prosecution. NIS officials also said they have delivered the cash under Lee`s direction. Prosecutors have tracked down a bank account to find evidence and checked Lee`s cell phone records, which led to questioning. One example is that Choe, who was deputy prime minister for economic affairs and minister of planning and finance, documented the National Intelligence Service's withdrawal accounts in Lee`s self-help book in October 2014, which said he gave 100 million won to former chairman Lee Byung-ki. Usually, when prosecutors obtained secret accounts of fund managers during lobbying fund investigations, they passed the 8-minute mark of investigation, according to the NIS investigation. Prosecutors say that former chairman Lee made a thorough statement on where to use the special expenses of the NIS. The lawyer seemed to have persuaded Lee to cooperate fiercely, a prosecution official said.▼ ' ○○ Year ○ Month ○ ○ billion…Check and secure secret fund account … ▼ Lee Heon-soo can only state by date where the money is to be spent, if it is to be made clear. It is known that the company is not only handing over lists but is also actively cooperating with further investigations into the details of the delivery. When the three former NIS chiefs ' arrest warrants were reviewed on July 16, Han reportedly argued, We should arrest Lee first in order of investigation. Lee said the idea of "" running from the special expenses for the NIS chiefs because of the lack of funds for the work at Cheong Wa Dae "" was sparked, but that he would avoid arrest alone. Some say that the prosecution is making a statement on the condition that Lee will investigate her daughter's wedding on July 19 without physical detention. They say the police have a kind of pleabaging system in which the accused can adjust the sentence in return for admitting guilty or making statements about someone else's crime. But even if Lee had made a list of bribes, it is unlikely that the team would want to protect him, despite the usual incident, said a lawyer who was a high-ranking prosecutor. Prosecutors often hide the testimony of bribery collaborators, and this time, Lee's statement was the starting point of their investigation, which is different from the case. Some NIS officials are known to be watching Lee`s active statement with a peep. The Roh Moo-hyun administration of former NIS chief Kim Man-bok, directly below when the Executive Director undertook yesangwan. Lee Myung-bak, have private contracts of staff problem at the time of inspection and survey in South Korean intelligence chief Won Sei-hoon of the government, former executive director of the right after a license. "" the buck to his men.Don't ask. I will carry them with me. "" Some say that there is a reason why prosecutors can not talk about Lee's cooperation in investigation. For example, whether some of the special activity expenses were personally misused or the investigation team was weakened by another incident. Lee, a former head of the NIS ' public affairs department, was responsible for internal financial affairs and administrative affairs until the third grade. A friend of Park Geun-hye, he was teaching at a government representative at the company that operates right after the inauguration of the Executive Director was appointed. Other than his close acquaintance with former secretary Ahn Bong-geun, the details of his appointment have not been fully disclosed. The Executive Director National Intelligence Service to charge of the budget and personnel of National Intelligence Service posts, in particular the first president, was appointed Executive Director immediately after the launch of the administration figures often.Many. Kim Dae-jung administration's igangnae, Suh of the Roh Moo-hyun government, Kim Ju-sung, former Executive Director of the Lee Myung-bak government representative. The Park Geun-hye of government kept positions throughout the four years. In addition, Lee has been granted greater power than the previous administration. Former president Nam Jae-jun said, I don`t want to be given any political misunderstanding, and the authority of the deputy chief of the national body, Vice Chairman of the National Assembly, and the head of the Legal Affairs Bureau, are all to judge whether or not to rule on compliance with the ministry. Lee will face not only high-ranking officials of Cheong Wa Dae, high-ranking government officials of the vice ministerial level, and lawmakers, but also high-ranking business officials of the company. There are more hot lines than the second car manager in charge of the nation, the source said.

It was inconvenient right after we got rid of the car, but now it is worth living, Yoon said, I plan to save and save my house unconditionally within five years. Korea`s key economic indicators are the recent boom, with domestic consumption hardly surviving. The gap between economic indicators that appear on the surface and the actual economic situation at the workplace is growing. Indeed, the export industries such as semiconductors, chemicals and automobiles were the driving forces behind the economic growth index. As the income situation of jobs and households, directly linked to private consumption at home, is lower than expected, sales of the retail sector, including department stores, remained negative. ▽ Kim Da-na Designer : Exports are up and the stock market is in a boom … In the third quarter of this year, real GDP hit a seven-year high of 1.4 %. Industrial production, retail sales and facility investment all increased in September. Exports are also sharply rising thanks to the semiconductor special, and this year's goal of GDP growth has turned green. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised Korea's economic growth rate this year to 3.2 percent. The stock market is also experiencing its biggest boom. It has been well over 2,500 since the KOSPI (Korea Composite Stock Price Index) hit the 2,000 mark for the first time in 10 years. It has been a tremendous explosion in a year since he was revised below the 2000 mark in the aftermath of last year's national struggle and falling oil prices. However, the index has not led to domestic consumption. Even with various large-scale discounts and generous gifts events, customers rarely opened their wallets. Three major department stores, Lotte, Hyundai and Shinsegae, were also affected by sluggish sales. Lotte Department Store saw its sales decline for the third straight quarter from a year earlier, with its first quarter posting 4.3 percent, - 5.6 percent and - 3.6 percent. Hyundai Department Store saw a decline from an eight-percent gain in the first quarter of this year to third-three percent and a third-three percent decline. Shinsegae Department Store, which had been on the rise until the second quarter of this year, also saw a decline of 0.7 percent in the third quarter.As sales of clothes, cosmetics and luxury goods, which are about to pick up after the economic recovery, have lost momentum, a senior official at the department store said, with many customers flocking to the restaurants./ Graphics = designer Kim Da-na ◇ trend of ` saving ` instead of ` Yolow ` … job insecurity, income reduction … Experts say that the recent sluggish domestic consumption is the only reason why they are encouraging people to spend money freely : ` Living up on you ` The recent podcast (Internet radio broadcasting) is so popular that Kim Saeng-min's receipt has become a regular broadcast on the network. Economics professor Ahn Seung-ho at Sungkyunkwan University said, We have become a society that does not feel ashamed of tightening our belts and saving money, saying, Because saving money is not an investment for the future, but an investment problem for the future. Ahn said, "" The current spending trend for some young people is so serious that they have reached a cliff over saving, "" adding, "" It's not about investing for the future ; it's about living, it's about to be a problem that they shouldn't want to live now. "" The "" family price "" trend, which has been around for many years, is another reason. One of the most popular products among retail companies is private brand (private brand), Uniqlo, Diso, and others, and seeing the products at a department store and comparing the prices of products online or by comparing them with the prices. Some say that the Japanese economy is beginning to show signs of a prolonged recession, in which it can not spend money due to vague anxiety. The poor employment and income situation is directly related to sluggish consumption. The number of employed Koreans rose to 26.86 million in the first half of this year from 2,235,000 in 2016. Yet the monthly employment turmoil continues. In fact, the number of manufacturing jobs classified as decent jobs decreased in September. Unemployment rose to 3.8 percent in the first half of this year from 3.7 percent in 2016.The average monthly income per household decreased from 4.86 million won at the end of last year to 4.47 million to 8183 won in the first half of this year. Economics professor at Sookmyung Women's University in Seoul Seo Yong-ju said, "" The major consumer group, the number of people in their 30s and 50s, and the growing anxiety about the future, made the trend of spending less money on middle-aged people, and therefore makes the trend of being unable to get jobs stronger. "" We should not equate the good economic indicators with the real economic sentiment felt by consumers, Suh added, We need to be cautious about follow-up measures, such as raising interest rates.

"Professor Lee Guk-jong of the North Korean Army briefings on the results of surgery and the patient condition of the North Korean soldier who defected with a bullet in a hospital in Aju University, Gyeonggi Province yesterday. Suwon : Yonhap News Agency announced on July 13 that a North Korean soldier defected from the Joint Security Area (JSA). The soldier's defection was a hot topic of conversation. The North Korean army fired 40 shots while he was riding down the military jeep to the South. The soldier was taken to the Southern branch of Kyung-gi University Hospital and underwent surgery to recover. Though the defection was in fact identical to that of North Korea, it received more attention as it was mostly used as a reference to the North Korean soldier's defection. The term Guisun was used this way because the former military authorities referred to soldiers who fled the country as "" refugees from the North "" to take advantage of their Cold War conflict. Some defectors have been warmly welcomed and settled in South Korean society, but not everyone.Captain Lee Ung-pyeong, warmly welcomed as a "" Welcome to the Resident""held to South Korea, shouts for a press conference after fleeing the MiG-19 fighter jet on February 25, 1983 at the Sejong Center in Seoul on March 4. Korean Daily Data Photography. On Friday morning, February 25, 1983, an anti-air warning siren sounded in Seoul and other metropolitan areas. The radio showed an urgent announcement from the Civil Defense Agency to evacuate, saying, This is a real situation for the public. This is because North Korea's MIG jet has crossed the Northern Limit Line in the Yellow Sea. As South Korea and the U.S. are training as a joint team player, North Korea is also on high alert according to its quasI-war posture. As the South Korean fighter jets on patrol got ready to intercept, the southbound MIG jet MiG 19 waved its wings and announced its surrender. The pilot of the MiG 19 plane, which landed at the Suwon airfield, was Colonel Lee Ung-pyeong, then a responsible pilot for the first group of the Korean People`s Army. We decided to leave the country because of the Samyang-ramyeon bag, he said in an interview after he defected. "" The Samyang Ramyeon, which became stranded with the casual donghae from alteration or damage in a sale or distribution processes, products are product bags did you pick up on there in outlets or company representative.Will replace ’, even small things with when he saw the convenience of the people in hundreds of thousands of South Korean society he wanted to come now, "" North Korean military officer is admired the South.Now that we have arrived at and valuable materiel to fighter jets, who voluntarily defected to the Chun Doo-hwan government, could not be welcome. The government held a welcoming rally to celebrate Lee`s defection in April of the same year in Yeouido. The competition attracted 1.3 million people. The government gave the colonel about 1.5 billion won in relocation aid, including a MiG grant and two homes. Lee's huge rewards were due to the competition in the inter-Korean regime. The Special Compensation Law on the Vietnam War, which went into effect in 1978, provides for the free and open working of refugees who have resisted their country's peaceful unification and were able to provide compensation for their livelihood. As there were not many defectors who defected, the government provided substantial rewards to increase the amount of gold by 1900g to 450g per person, and free housing with a size of 15mm or more.Lee Ung-pyeong holds a bouquet of flowers at a welcoming rally for defection in Yeouido, Seoul on April 14, 1983. Korean Daily Data Photography. Lee has adapted well to South Korea. He was commissioned as a major in the Korean Air Force and married the daughter of an Air Force Academy professor the following year to start a family. It also served as a good advocate for the defection. When Kim Man-cheol and 11 other family members fled North Korea on a small boat in 1987, Lee actively persuaded the South to go to the North. However, he suffered the thoughts of his family that he had left behind in the North all his life, and was afraid of the North Korean government's retaliation. Lee's wife said in an interview that she was extremely nervous when her husband told her that she would not let her eat rice cakes or milk delivered by her neighbors while using crotchete-detectable silver. Lee was promoted to Air Force colonel, but died of a chronic disease in 2002 and was buried at Daejeon National Cemetery.Captain Lee Chul-soo (right), who defected in a combat plane in May 1996, is waving at a news conference with Colonel Lee Ung-pyeong (left) who defected in 1983. Korean Daily Data Photography. There are defectors who have pulled North Korean fighter jets directly since the 1990s. Captain Lee Chul-soo, who defected on May 23, 1996. It was a time of extreme tension between the two Koreas. It was on May 17 when a North Korean patrol boat invaded waters near Yeonpyeong Island and crossed the border three times after it unilaterally announced that it would not comply with the DMZ maintenance regulations in April.When Lee flew in, he was also tense for about 30 minutes. The Seoul Mayor, Cho Soon, apologized urgently as an alarm bell was not sounded in Seoul without confirming whether Lee`s arrival as an air strike or a defection, and four officials from the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Management were reprimanded. Lee said, I could not live in a hell of a society anymore, but there were also complaints about why he had to defect. The North Korean authorities promoted her successor first, and a political advisor in the unit bullied her. Lee was also given 478 million won in return for the plane and fixed money, and was promoted to colonel in 2010.A strange visitor appeared at the GP on April 27, 2008 in Paju, Gyeonggi Province, convicted of attempting to murder his wife in a bid to kill a knock-out celebrity. Lee Chul-ho, the lieutenant of the 15th Division of the North Korean Army, walked to the South Korean railway line and defected. After crossing the iron railing, he took off and shot into the G.O.P. in front of our side, but when no response was given, he went to GP and knocked on the door, calling out Korean soldiers. After he defected from the North, Lee appeared on a TV show and became famous for telling the truth about North Korea. He was the first defector to the North Korean military command of the Korean Central Command, and received great attention for his thorough knowledge of the North Korean military intelligence and defense posture.She seemed to settle down in South Korea by marrying a female defector in 2012, having a family and a baby. However, he had difficulty in adjusting to the jobs he got through a group of North Korean defectors, and was fired immediately. He emigrated from Belgium in 2013, but lost all of his property due to fraud and his relationship with his wife went sour.Lee choked his wife while arguing for a reunion at her home in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, in 2014 when she was being sued for divorce. He was sentenced to two and a half years in jail on charges of attempted murder when his wife, who he thought had suffocated to death, regained consciousness.Shin Hye-jung, Editorial Writer, arete@hankookilbo.com[Unrestricted reproduction and redistribution by Hankook Ilbo (hankookilbo.com), yesterday does not result in the conclusion of the Defense Business Promotion Committee … The Korea Defense Agency, Korea's 2nd Army, and the Korea Army's 2nd Army's main battle tank, K2, will be training for the introduction of overseas transmissions. According to the military authorities on July 18, Defense Minister Song Young-moo failed to reach a conclusion on a variety of ideas for promoting the second mass production of K2 at the Defense Committee held the day before. Therefore, the plan to push ahead with the second mass production of K2 tanks has been put up for discussion. The main issue of the conference was the poor performance of the Korea Electric Power Pack (engines and transmissions), which is to be installed in K2 in Yangsan. The first mass production project of K2 tanks will have German power packs and have operated since 2014, but the second project will have a domestic power pack, which was conducted six times since January last year. During the first production inspection of the secondary products, the transmission bolts were cracked and the pressure dropped, which caused them to fail to function properly. Local defense companies are developing power packs for the K2 tanks and argue the military has a problem with equity due to the country`s tougher durability standards of transmission. Regarding this, the KCDC said, "" Companies agreed on the standard of transmission durability, and it is not possible to change it now. "" The issue was also controversial in last month's parliamentary inspection of the National Defense Commission at the Korea Defense Security Council. The Defense Planning Committee is also known to have argued over the necessity of easing the durability standards of transmission and opposing arguments. The agency is pushing for another test with the same durability standards, but it is uncertain whether the results will be achieved due to opposition from businesses. Companies have filed an application for an injunction demanding the suspension of the test. The agency is pushing for an alternative plan to use foreign cars and local engines to keep Korean ones in production, in case Korean transmissions for the second generation are found to be deficient in performance. The demonstration of the power pack combining a foreign transmission and a Korean engine will be completed sometime next month. If the technology is successfully proven, the agency will propose to introduce a plan to produce K2 tanks equipped with foreign transmissions and Korean engines to submit it to the Defense Acquisition Committee early next year. We can not delay any more of the K2 production projects because they have been delayed for quite some time, a military official said. ljglory@yna.co.kr"
"Even before the YemenishutI rebels ' missile offensive in Saudi Arabia Monday, attackers also bought a high-tech THAAD missile system from the United States, which is equipped with the U.S., China, Russia, and Russia's missile defense system Saudi Air Forces reportedly intercepted a missile as it headed for Kingkalid International Airport over the northeastern part of Riyadh. BBC reported that the missile fragments were flown to the airport parking lot. The news covered up the fact that Prince Muhammad bin Salman al-Sauds (32) arrested 11 princes, four present ministers, and dozens of ex-ministers, but it was no less a purge in importance. The Saudi Defense Ministry said the missile was launched by a Shi'ite Huti rebel from Riyadh, which is 12 kilometers away. Sabah News, Yemen's Sabah, operated by the Huti rebels, said the missile was Burkan H2O, its own developed long-range missile. Western intelligence agencies are focusing on the possibility that the Huti`s forces were provided with the finished products from Iran or reassembled with parts before assembling them, rather than having developed their own long-range missiles. That is because the Huties are supported by Iran, which has missile ties with North Korea. The New York Times said it was not the first time that the Huties had attacked a missile, but the first time they had flown to a private airport in the heart. Bbc huti, according to the rebels last May Donald Trump made missiles in the previous day to visit the American president leaves Saudi Arabia. They were intercepted 200 kilometers from Riyadh and avoided the sight of news. The first missile that the Saudi missile Huti rebels launched into Saudi Arabia was June 6, 2015, when they were first held or deployed. This came shortly after Saudi decided to form a Sunni coalition and intervene in the Yemen civil war. In Yemen, a civil war broke out in 2014 when Shi'ite, Hutian rebels attacked the Sunni Abd Rabbo Mansour Hardy government. Saudi joined in the civil war in 2015 by forming a Sunni coalition and supporting the Hardy government. Saudi claims it has hijacked all of the Huti rebels ' missiles. But Saudi Ambassador Abdullah Nalmu said, Huti rebels carried out 1700 attacks against Saudi civilians, killing 500 civilians. Yemen launched 57 Scud missiles off Saudi Arabia until August 15, according to military officials. Saudi Arabia cut 40 of the shots, and 17 hit the target. Foreign news reports are a little different. More than 100 missiles were hijacked by the Taliban from January 2015 to April 2017, and more than 90 of them were allegedly hijacked. The Huties ' missile capability is considerable. The U.S. Navy and the Sunni coalition also attacked the ship with surface-to-surface missiles, which the U.S. Navy used to intercept with SM-2 missiles. In the civil war, the Huties are actively using missiles for tactical purposes. In February, he hit a 750-kilometer-long government military command post with a ballistic missile, killing senior officers, including a lieutenant general. The ' War on the Shields ' between the Missile and the Interference Missile (missile) is catching fire not only between superpowers, but Saudi Arabia in the Middle East desert and the Huti rebels in Yemen. As such, missiles have spread throughout the world. It also means that the threat of missiles is now common. With North Korea threatening the world with a ballistic missile, we need to prepare ourselves aggressively. Saudi made a bold decision as the confrontation between the missiles and the interceptor missile intensified. The U.S. plans to purchase the THAAD·Sad system and put it into action. It is an advanced weapons system that can not compare with the facility defense system of airports and military bases. It can defend up to 150 kilometers from a 200 km radius of operation, so it can protect one area. The problem is the U.S. ' approval and the estimated cost of introducing the fund, which amounts to $ 15 billion. The U.S. Defense Department approved the sale of Saudi Arabia at the beginning of September. This is the first time that the THAAD system is purchased and placed in the country. Saudi War, Conflict, and Security Countermeasures ● Send troops to Bahrain in 2011 due to pro-democracy protests ● Support for Sunni insurgents during the Syrian civil war, including the presence of Sunni insurgents in the Syrian civil war ● from 2015 and the presence of Sunni insurgents in the Iraq-2005 ● post-  missile defense forces in Iraq ● Saudi King Salman held a summit in Moscow on October 5 and agreed to purchase the S-400. The purchase amount is not immediately known but is estimated to reach between $ 2 billion and $ 4 billion. The United States ally, Saudi, is not very good with Russia. Nevertheless, he decided to buy a Russian weapons system with no emotion for the security goal of missile defense. It is the first time in the world that the United States ' THAAD (THAAD) and Russia's S-400 are held simultaneously. Saudi Arabia's security pragmatism is on the way. India and China have decided to introduce the treaty, and Turkey, a member of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), is showing interest. Saudi has already imported DF-3 missiles from China in 1988 and DF-21 ballistic missiles from 2007 for deployment. DF-21 is a machined weapon that strikes a ground target in the range of 1700 kilometers and a warship at a height of Mach 10. Saudi is the only country that has missile deals with the United States, Russia, and China. According to the military, it is said that "" to see the future of the Korean Peninsula's missile warfare, see Yemen with funds. "" Saudi Arabia, which has even changed its foreign policy to protect its missiles, needs to pay attention to its options. We can not rule out the possibility that North Korea's technology sent to Iran was used for missiles flying to Saudi Arabia. What is happening in Yemen and Saudi Arabia is quite possible on the Korean Peninsula. [S BOX] South Korea's missile defense, its one-ply armor Patriot, and the ROK Armed Forces launched a massive retaliation against North Korea's threat of nuclear and missile strikes against the North and launched a "" Kill Chain, "" or "" War "" in the near future KAMD`s missile intercept before it reaches Korean soil. When North Korea shoots missiles, anti-ballistic early warning radars or Aegis destroyers radars are detection. Korean troops introduced two Israeli green pine radars (detection distances of more than 600 kilometers) in 2012 and used them as early warning and control radars. Another option is to buy two more of the same radar. The SPY-1TD (v) radar fitted to three Aegis destroyers such as the Sejongdae Navy, Yulgai Navy and Seohae-ryong-ryong Navy can detect ballistic missiles 1,000 kilometers away. The problem is the interceptor missile. Currently, the only missile that South Korea can intercept is the U.S.-made Patrice missile. In other words, KAMD`s only armor is flat. The military is in the process of upgrading the Patrice missile base from PAC-2 to the new PAC-3. It is an effort to put on layers of armor. The Agency for Defense Development is in the process of improving the anti-air missile defense. The Cheonan can only intercept aircraft, but it is intended to add to its ability to drop missiles. It is also developing a new missile called L-SAT (anti-ballistic missile), and is planning to build three more Aegis destroyers and build SM-3 missiles. U.S. Forces in Korea will also conduct joint operations with Korean troops using the THAAD·Sad system in case of emergency."

"Local launch on July 24 … 252GB, 1.55 million won carrier's support fee, "" Let's face it, "" and "" Let's face it, "" an explanation about the "" Let's face it, "" resulting in Apple's "" sell out of fees. IPhone X, which was released in the U.S., China and Japan on July 3 and is scheduled to be released in Korea on July 24, will be sold for 1,557,700 won (256 GB) and 1,360,000 GB (1996 GB). Samsung's premium smartphone Galaxy Note 8 is about 300,000 won higher than its initial price of 125,400 won (256 GB). Most consumers receive public support during the contract period or receive optional discounts on mobile phone usage. However, as the price of iPhone X is very high, consumers will have to pay 1.2 million won for the device even though they receive support. The public support fee for the iPhone X, set by SK Telecom on July 17, was 122,000 won from the highest price, which is about one tenth of the original price. Even with additional support from the retail store, the actual purchase price of an iPhone X (64GB) is 122,400 won. The same amount of public support for the iPhone 8 and the higher price of the terminal makes consumers feel burdened. Under the fee-based plan for the 60,000 won to 72,000 won most consumers, public support is only 60,000-71,000 won. You can get a cheaper price by using the selective drug discount system. If you use the 110,000-won system, you can get a maximum discount of 660,000 won. Most consumers are expected to choose a discount system instead of publicly available funds. The initial high price of output is also pointed out as a problem. Apple Korea has set much higher handset prices than other countries, including the United States and Japan. The iPhone X costs a pre-tax $ 999 thousand (about 109,741 won) in the U.S. and 118,800 yen (about 1.1 million won) in Japan. Even when VAT is considered, about 200,000 won is more expensive here. In the United States, the iPad Pro 10.5 is sold for $ 999, the same as the iPhone X, in which the iPhone X and iPad programs are sold for $ 137,000 and 100,000, respectively, at 129,000 won. Regarding the price controversy, Apple Korea only reiterates, "" Product prices vary according to the exchange rate and customs policies of the country. "" The Fair Trade Commission is also investigating Apple Korea`s mobile operators ' policies to pass off advertising fees and repair. Many flaws, especially those raised by the first national market of the iPhone X, including the United States and Japan, are also problematic. The problem of having a vertical green line in the liquid crystal of an iPhone X and the problem of stopping smartphone operation when the temperature falls is typical. As more and more Americans complained about the problem, the U.S. IT industry began to call it the Green Line Gate. Other problems include the buzzing sound from embedded speakers and the face recognition function, the face ID function. Most banks here have decided to limit mobile banking using a face ID because of security concerns. The controversy over the malfunction of the iPhone X will likely arise further when the iPhone X is released in Korea on July 24. The previous work, the iPhone 8, also saw its battery rise, raising the quality controversy. Nevertheless, most sales of iPhone X reservations by mobile phone companies on July 17 were sold out. According to SK Telecom, online booking began at 9:00 a.m. and the second booking began at 6:00 p.m. and ended at 1:50 seconds. KT Freetel has more than 20,000 customers booked in five minutes. However, the initial volume of the three service providers ' plans to receive a supply from Apple is estimated to be around 150,000 units, half of the original iPhone 8. Some analysts say the iPhone X symbol of the 10th anniversary smartphone has been used by loyal Apple customers, and will continue to be popular for the time being. Apple's arrogant marketing policies tend to make consumers follow what is called an iPhone, said Lee Joon-young, a professor of consumer housing at Sangmyung University.

"Dr. Park Eun-jung, a professor of medicine at Aju University in Seoul who is 50 years old, married, pregnant retired mother, and a father-in-law who grew up as a mother of a mother, died of premature birth at age 41 and wrote a report on nanotoxicity research. Oh Jong-taek, "" former soil spoon, career break ups, contract room research professor, glass ceiling to break. "" Park was ranked the "" World's Top 1 % Research in 2017 "" by the global information and analysis firm Claverse Analytics (formerly Thompson Reuters) on July 15. She was named one of the top Korean scientists, Professor Hyun Taek-hwan of Seoul National University and Professor Lee Sang-yeop of KAIST. It is also the second abnormal record for a HCR spot since last year. Especially, he is on the summit after overcoming many contradictions and innunciations in academia and society. I am a career divorced woman, Professor Park told The HCR at the Four Seasons Hotel in Gwanghwamun, Seoul. He is not the right person to come to this place. "" As a researcher, Park has been absent from the research center all her life. Because of the nature of toxicologists, this can cause problems if cosmetics and toxins meet in the lab. Oh Jong-taek, a Korean journalist, is another word for irregular researchers at a university. I visited the University of Azu in Suwon where Professor Park is on the morning of July 17. He was sitting in a tiny desk, less than half the size of a regular desk, in the corner of the brain science lab on the fourth floor of a medical school building. His major is nanotoxicity, the field that studies the toxicity of nanomaterials in recent issues. Although it has nothing to do with brain science laboratories, she is staying in a cell on the condition that she pays for lab materials. Park entered Dongduk University as a four-year scholarship student with a degree in health care. She applied to university to get a four-year scholarship because her family was in trouble during high school. Originally, his dream was to become a medical school, but both universities and majors were forced to compromise with reality. The dream was too far away. He joined Korea Electric Power Corp. as a special manager at the end of fourth grade. At least he had to leave the company in less than a year due to the pregnancy of his first child and poor health. I wanted to continue studying, but this time a little boy was trampled on. Park is like a ' little tank ' for research. Once a student is absorbed in a study, he or she does not go home and lives in a laboratory for a week. It is 10 minutes walk from the house where he lives now. Oh Jong-taek entered the graduate school of Pharmacology College at his alma mater after the age of three. After two years of master's course, she had to take another break from studying. The year of graduation came hard times. After the child was diagnosed with leukemia, her mother died of pancreatic cancer. A month later, her father-in-law was diagnosed with end-stage esophageal cancer. Instead of studying, the years of care continued. The challenge to the doctor's degree again came eight years after graduation. This time, her husband quit his job to help Professor Park. If you quit studying now, you can not do it anymore. Is that okay? Instead of answering, Professor Park just cried. "" I'll help you this time because you've had a long time to care, "" he said after sleep. Professor Park was curious about the family's continued outbreak. It was thought that the pollution around our lives was the cause of all illnesses. In the course of his doctorate, he studied nanotoxicity under the theme of "" Identifying the cause of environmental diseases. "" She ran contests and university offices around the country to find clues to her research. I have been to anywhere from Chungcheong-do to Jeju Island, he said. There was a time when he did not sleep for three nights and four days to conduct research that was like conducting a mouse cell experiment without a laboratory colleague. So I finished my doctor's course in three years. He published five papers in an overseas journal of the International Science Index (SCI) level. It was an unusual achievement at his alma mater. But there was nowhere to call. She was not a doctor at a prestigious university, and was already 40 years old when she was a ' pregnant woman. ' Eventually, he remained as a researcher at the school and continued his research. Although Professor Park had many adverse conditions in becoming a researcher, such as career break and female researchers, middle-aged people, and screaming universities, her passion for her studies overcame many hurdles. Oh's career came in 2011, three years after his doctorate. Around by the introduction of an acquaintance. National Research Foundation of Korea applied for ‘president Fellowship poseuteudak’. It was a program to select talented people out of irregular researchers who have been working for less than seven years to earn a doctorate. He earned a fellowship and received 150 million won in research support for five years. It was also thanks to the fellowship that he got a job as a research professor at Azu University. Although he is still a professor of contract research, his writings have become famous among epidemiologists, with more than 400-500 entries per book. In recognition of his achievements, he received the Knowledge Economy Minister award from the Ministry of Science and Technology for his achievements in late 2015. After 2016, this year was the result of ranking as the world's top 1 % researcher (HCR). Professor Park, who is a professor of irregular workers ` studies, has written 65 SCI papers and 85 Korean journals combined. When she wrote many papers, she wrote up to 16 a year. However, despite the "" specs, "" Korean universities ignored Park. The paper was a brilliant piece, but nowhere was it that welcomed Dr.Christendom Moon-cheol, who had just turned 50. As university evaluations are prevalent both in home and abroad, it is possible that students of the same ' high-specialized ' academic rank as Professor Park would be raised. However, the local academic climate has refused, as professors already in the department are reluctant to accept the elderly as junior professors. Professor Park's desk and lab are micro-minis. Less than half of the usual desk is located in the corner of the University of Azu's Institute of Brain and Sciences. Professor Park, who met Oh Jong-taek at a small lab, smiled brightly. "" I love doing this, anyway. There are a lot of people who laugh about it, but I'll win a Nobel Prize for it. "" Park Eun-jung, a professor at the University of America's School of Medicine at Harvard's University of Science and Technology, met with Choi Jon-ho, reporter Joon-ho, and mobile networking at http://joongang.co.kr"
"Salarymen are not easy either, but self-employment is really harder, although some scholars say the macroeconomic conditions have improved here, it is just pie in the sky. The average working class is still experiencing the depth of winter.These days, major commercial buildings are empty on the first floor, he said. `` It seems like the worst recession ever is happening. Nine out of 10 self-employed people have no choice but to close after all, he argued.When I register for my business, I get various notices to pay for my four major insurance, health insurance, and national pension, said C, I can`t take a good rest on weekdays, day, weekend, and holidays. The problem is that I don`t make any money properly despite all the hard work I have done.`` I feel it every time I run the restaurant, but it is too expensive to get reproduced. It is quite a blessing for private businesses, not corporations, to find good employees who work well, he said.If there is some business going on in the neighborhood, big businesses around here are launching brand new products with similar items, creating a brand name, E said. That is why many businesses are starting businesses in the form of franchises, and that is why it is only good for our headquarters, '' he said.Three out of 10 businessmen who entered business recently had less than five million won in seed money.Analysts say that last year, more and more people were forced to leave their jobs in the aftermath of the restructuring and start their own businesses to earn a living.The latest data were published by the National Statistical Office in August 2017, which showed the results of a non-payable supplementary report on working conditions. The survey was conducted by non-paid workers of 32,000 households as of August this year.When referring to business funds referring to seed money, less than 5 million won was the most important factor, or 28.3 percent of the total. It was found that the order of persons who received the information was 1.2 % or more with the following :50.3 percent of the self-employed paid less than 20 million won in seed money were self-employed, which were more than half.Compared with the previous survey in August 2015, the range of 5 to 20 million won increased by 3.5 percentage points, the highest increase.In general, it is recognized that the higher the seed money, the higher the expected profit and stability.The results of this year`s survey show that small business owners are running their businesses.The problem with the less than three out of ten self-employed people and the less than five million won in seed money is that the situation has become worse in recent years.If the starting time of small business is shortened from two years to less than one year, the proportion of small business owners will grow to 5,500,000 won and 5,000-200,000,000 won, respectively.When it comes to raising seed money, 68.8 percent of the money was raised by themselves or their family, but not a few borrowed money was.Banks, insurance companies and mutual savings and financial companies ranked at 1.4 percent, with 31.5 percent, followed by relatives and partners ' funds, 7.8 percent, 5.0 percent borrowing from others, and government support or support.This is a testament to the weakness in the capital of self-employed.The most difficult aspect of starting a project was the one that was cited as the most frequent source of business financing (28.6 %).Considering that the jobless rate rose 1.3 percent from two years ago, it can be interpreted that the small business owners in the era experienced a greater loss in their jobs.More than half (57.4 percent) of those who entered the business due to poor earnings ···It is also possible that he lost his job after earning a stable salary and was forced to work for his own business to make ends meet.Nine out of 10 respondents (88.9 percent) answered that their business preparation period was less than one year. In one to three months, 52.0 % were also found to be more than half.Other business motives reported were ' I want to run my own business myself ' (71.0 %), and ' I have difficulty finding work as a wage earner, ' and ' I have to answer ' I want to do my own business ' (12.5 %).A bigger problem is that the outlook for the future is not very bright as the self-employed are already saturated.As a result of an analysis of the changes in the sector while doing other self-employment, the reasons for the switch in the business sector were the most, 36.8 percent, for "" switching to a more lucrative business. "" The following were due to sluggish business ahead (27.0 %) and no prospect of business ahead (17.0 %).In other words, they didn't make much money.Kim Hyun-ju, a journalist at hjk@segye.com Many people were frustrated because they did not know when they would be able to go home or whether they would be able to live at home. Dozens of office workers gathered in the Pohang city of Heunghae-eup to report the damages. The telephone rang nonstop beside the desk. Taxi driver Kim Ki-chang (67), who brought in 80 grandmothers, said, I slept with 16 family members in a 6-pyong container near my house, but no government officials have been able to avoid it since. I am so nervous, I can`t go back in.About 150 people were displaced by the incident at Daedo Middle School in the North, one of the evacuation centers at 2:00 p.m. They have to move to a church about 6 kilometers from here tomorrow. Kim Soon-hee (62), a resident who was sitting with a tired look, said, I don`t know if my house is safe, and I`m afraid to go to a remote church. Do you happen to know when you can go home?What to do … - A victim who is staying at a public gym in the northern part of Pohang City, hugs her young daughter with a blanket on Tuesday. Mom and daughter wore masks in cold weather. Children were seen nagging at their parents, "" When can I go home? "" / The Yonhap news administration wants to determine when the evacuated residents will return home. Local authorities should not be forced to step up to the plate because residential areas are private buildings, said an official at Pohang Disaster Prevention and Countermeasures Headquarters. There is no manual on how to secure homes for earthquake victims. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOCT) said yesterday that it would provide 160 homes for the victims, but it is far from enough compared to the total number of victims.The earthquake victims of the building will be notified by an evaluation team formed by the Disaster and Safety Countermeasures at local governments. However, it is up to the residents to decide whether or not to move. Pohang City set up a risk assessment team with 36 members from 10 teams to assess 1,500 structures affected by the attack. Builders and civil servants in a group will apply green (available), yellow (restricted), and red (dangerous) labels. However, it is up to the residents to judge what to do after the evaluation team makes an appearance. It is up to the owner to decide whether to repair the limit of use or the hazard class. For more precise inspections than visual confirmation of appearance, the owner of the building must bear the full cost.The ministry said, We have no other option but to provide disaster assistance to private facilities. An official at the Ministry of Public Administration and Security said, "" Emergency recovery is when public facilities such as roads or fences are collapsed. "" "" Most residents do volunteer work to repair damages on their own. ""Unlike Korea, which residents say should be dealt with on its own, Japan will start to secure housing by taking action right after the earthquake. It is due to the fact that the manual for earthquake response is in place. When the 6.5-magnitude earthquake hit Kumamoto Prefecture last April, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport set up a Central Emergency Response Headquarters and sent a detachment of emergency measures. Kumamoto Prefecture was an earthquake-free region, but it was able to respond quickly according to the guidelines. Tens of thousands of residents stayed in shelters, but there was no panic like Pohang. The ministry asked local accommodations, the real estate industry and local governments to help secure more than 10,000 homes, temporary apartments, and empty houses to accommodate the victims. After the damaged apartments were inspected and their buildings were checked, the residents of the affected apartments were asked to stay in houses with their land transportation systems secured until they had been repaired safely.Cho Won-chul, honorary professor of social and environmental systems at Yonsei University, said, "" It is not only about judging on the risks involved in the building, it is not only about being accurate, it is also about ensuring that the standards of facility safety assessment are low.

"The U.S. electric car maker Tesla opened its first truck on July 16 (local time) with a 36-ton cargo and four 800 kilometer-long electric motors launched in 2019. The CEO of the company held an open exhibition on the first electric truck, Tesla Semi, at Hawthorne, Space-X.What is most unique about semi-electric trucks is that the driver's seat is in the middle, not to the left of the vehicle. It will help the driver broaden his horizons, Musk explained. In addition, the handle has a touch screen on either side. The driver's perimeter is very wide because there is no engine required. "" A semi-electric truck can run up to 500 miles (804 kilometers) with a load of 80,000 pounds (36 tons) per charge, "" said Musk. In addition, he added, "" We will allow the car to run 400 miles (645 kilometers) by charging it immediately. "" The truck is equipped with four electric motors of model 3. They can reach 60 miles per hour in just 20 seconds. "" Tesla's semi-automatic driving ability enables drivers to drive on highways independently, "" said Musk, an event video clip of Tesla's electric truck show. Tesla is scheduled to go into mass production starting in 2019. It costs 250,000 dollars, and a deposit of five thousand dollars (5.5 million won) enables the reservation process.

In the U.S. state of California, trucks account for only 7 percent of cars ; however, greenhouse gas emissions account for 20 percent of cars ; and nitrogen oxides account for one-third of all vehicles.The show also unveiled a new model of Tesla's first electric car, Roadster, which was released in 2008. The new roadster can reach 60 miles per hour in 1.9 seconds and 100 miles per hour in 4.2 seconds. It also has a 200-kilowatt battery, allowing for up to 620 miles per charge. The maximum speed is 250 miles (402 kilometers) per hour. The year of its release is 2020, and the price is around 200,000 dollars.

Compared to last year's iPhone 7 sold out 20 minutes in the first and one hour in the second, it is very fast.The iPhone x64 GB model sold for $ 999 million in the United States, but is sold for $ 1237 (about 1,360,000) in Korea, according to the IT Media Arena on Tuesday. Still, it`s interesting to sell out in a short time. It is also the courtyard of Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics that contributed to this, he added.The iPhone X's domestic mobile phone price is 1,367,000 won for 64GB models and 1,556,700 won for 256GB. The sales figures are basically due to the lack of iPhone X. Less than half of the iPhone 8's iPhone's product is known to have been manufactured by Apple. In addition, the cost of the trip to the United States does not include different taxes for each state. SK Telecom, meanwhile, began its online booking at 10:00 a.m. on July 18.

"Residents of Daeseong Apartment in northern Pohang sit down on July 17 after moving their belongings.[Pohang : Economic Research Institute of Asia journalist, Kim Min-young] said, "" I lived here for 27 years and have been able to live because of the earthquake. I have to move out of my way to live here no more. "" On July 17, the second largest ever quake, the woman (played by Park Yong-seung) in front of her 63, Daeseong Apartment House in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province.Park, who is likely to fall at any time due to cracks and cracks in the wall due to an earthquake on July 15, did not start to lift her luggage until the third day of the earthquake.I don`t think I can live here any more, so I will move into my daughter's house first, Park said, It is sad to know that I lived here for 27 years after the apartment was built. On this day, people were crowded with people moving things out of their homes. The wall outside the Daeseong apartment building was sparsely dotted with serious cracks. A house on the first floor was a giddy goat that seemed to sink and fall down at any moment.On the first day of the earthquake, residents who were unable to enter their homes due to worries of an accident began moving into their relatives or acquaintances from emergency items such as clothes or valuables from the previous day. However, residents who have no place to carry their luggage or those who have no room to leave bulky packages such as refrigerators and air conditioners complained of being frustrated.Kim (58), who lives on the fourth floor of the apartment, said, "" I've got to go home and get my stuff, and I've got to leave my head in the clouds so I can't take my things with me. "" "" Jim lives nearby.In front of Kim was a pile of blankets, frames, books, and kitchen tools. When I left work on the day of the earthquake, I could not even get in, Kim said, When I went home the next day, everything was falling apart.We lost electricity at home and the refrigerator is in a mess, Kim said, adding, I have still brought out what was in the freezer because it was still cold. Kim's family lives nearby, but people with no relatives around him do not have room to sleep, so he sleeps in a temporary shelter at the gym. According to the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Agency, 17 to 97 people who lost or split their homes are waiting for their homes to return home, sleeping curled up.Even if we repair the apartment, I can`t get in now, Kim said, I live with my older sister at home, but I don`t know where to go even though I have to move soon.On the first floor of this apartment building, A still gets a hair stand on end when she thinks about the day of the earthquake. At the time, he could not even evacuate because of a crack in the wall of the front door due to a sudden earthquake. The house wall on the first floor of Daeseong Apartment is cracked by an earthquake on July 15.After 20 minutes of fear, A was forced to leave the room by the firemen. `` I don't even remember how I came out of a complete panic, '' he said.Mr. A is currently temporarily resident in his mother's cottage. We could move our luggage by 10 to 20 million won, and we had to have a place to live with my wife first, so we moved quickly, he said.`` Even neighbors go there when they have children or relatives, and they go to the gym if they don`t, '' A said. `` Few rich people in the apartment are.

It is strange. When I went to see it, water was pouring from the rice paddy field. "" Heo Nam-gon (41), a farmer in Heunghae-eup, Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, witnessed the flow of water on the paddy field on the 15th.Heo's rice field is 2 kilometers south of the epicenter, but the rice field around Gwanjeong Island is said to have been flooded simultaneously.`` It is the first time in my life that I have done this, '' he told The Daily News on Tuesday.The reason why the water springs from the paddy field is because of a phenomenon called liquefaction. It is the first time that an earthquake made liquid known in Korea.A "" liquid phenomenon "" is emerging at the rice paddy field near the epicenter of Yongcheon-ri, Heunghae-eup, Buk-gu, Pohang-si, Gyeongbuk Province, Korea, Korea, on July 17, three days after a massive earthquake with 5.4. Liquidation is the first time that the ground becomes softer due to strong earthquake and rises with groundwater.Pohang : Ha Sang-yoon (left) and Pohang (right) are two of the stories that show the swollen paddy (left) and the general rice field (right) with water.The alluvial layer (sediment), such as in the northern part of the country of the quake, is a mixture of soil and water. Normally, the two sides have balanced proportions so it is not a problem, but when an earthquake occurs and the ground leans or cracks, the water can be drawn to one side. Then, the sides of the water are liquid and the ground water rises to the surface, making the ground surface soft and soft.On the other hand, where the water is reduced, the soil becomes loose and becomes weaker than usual, just as it is at the liquid point. "" Liquefaction can occur regardless of the size of the quake, but it has not occurred in the liquid hillsides, mostly in the Kyung-am region, "" said Professor Yoon Seong-hyo of the university.Professor of earth science education at the Korea National University of Education, Gyeongjaebok said, If there is a strong earthquake, settlement takes place where water cracks.Yoonjiro, Pohang = reporter Ha Sang-yoon (gija), kornyap@segye.com ⓒ neun nun ilbo, Global Media Daily"
"Innovative Virtual Money Why is It Only Used in the Underground Economy? # 1 Public book, "" The Block Chain, "" a credit history transfer. Would it be possible to establish itself as a mere fad to attract speculative capital? Is it the Getty image bank's innovation or bubble? Since the first appearance of Bitcone in January 2009, its prospects have been mixed. Although high expectations have been gathered on the payout of virtual currencies without central control, the rosy future of ' single global currency ' to replace the current one is far from enough. Why is the most valuable and unpopular currency? The innovations of deneutralization, and the acclaim of developers and supporters for the block chain Bitcone, are really about the core technology, the block chain. A new concept of cipher, the block chain, is simply a form of public book. It can be applied to several platforms, and the Bitcone system ensures safe money transaction by replacing the verification and control of government or financial institutions. In other words, when purchasing and selling things with virtual money made entirely out of data, they can prevent double payment by duplicating items. It's like this. Transactions made everywhere are made in blocks of new transaction history every 10 minutes and are constantly updated in streamlining, sending and sharing the information to all network participants. Since the books are shared by users around the world, no one can fabricate the transactions. Hacking is also meaningless. If some servers are destroyed, they can be copied from anywhere else. There is no reason for the government, financial institutions and brokers to intervene. The benefit of being secure without a central management body is attractive to the advocates. Block chain technologies can revolutionize all areas that need authentication and security. When selling used cars, it is impossible to manipulate or fabricate a car if the accident, repair history, and mileage information held by manufacturers, insurance companies, and businesses are shared with block chains. That is why the Seoul Metropolitan Government decided to apply block chain technologies to the market of Janganpyeong used-car sales system by next March. Since last year, Wal-Mart and IBM in China have adopted block chain technologies for distribution and distribution of pork in China. Consumers can check the entire process of meat production, slaughter, and distribution with their smartphones. Major financial institutions around the world, including JP Morgan Chase, Visa, MasterCard and Blacklock, and the World Economic Forum (WEF) forecast that 80 percent of global banks will build a block chain technology system by this year. The WEF predicted that the global government would collect taxpayers ' money with block chains by 2023 and that 10 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) from 2027 will be saved with block chain technologies. We have a block chain that optimizes when all our physical assets are digitalized and distributed, said Eo Jun-sun Coinplug, director of Coinplug Corp., referring to the domestic companies as a block chain whose copyright rights are to be distributed.It was the underground economy that first opened its eyes to the extraordinary attributes of Bitcone, such as dispersion and anonymity. Though it has become a means of paying for the Getty Image-Bank black market, the results of the innovations were first seen in the black market, including drug trafficking and illegal weapons. Unlike other payment methods, anonymity is guaranteed. The public key, the address of the Bitcone account, and the private key that can be used are all available anywhere, but all other personal information is not needed and is misused in the underground economy.The "" Silk Road incident, "" an illegal drug dealing site using Bitcone, is a typical example. Silk Road, which had bankrolled drug and other commodities dealings since 2011, raised sales of 9.5 million BTCs (about $ 1.2 billion) with the closing of the FBI. In January 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Charlie Shrem (24), founder of Bitcone Trading Company, and Robert Peela (52), an online drug dealer, for money laundering. When the users who wanted to wash the clothes gave them cash, the drug dealer bought the bit coins from the bit shop and washed the money and gave it back. Of course, the trail is not entirely loose. Transaction details are distributed to all participants so they can track all transactions in the past. In addition, each transaction can be identified by the user's Internet Protocol (IP) address. As the local Bitcone Exchange allows users to withdraw their bills from their bank accounts, it is possible to track the users through a bank account when exchanging coins. Hong Ki-hun, a management professor at Hongik University, said, "" This is why the Bitcone Crime is brought out in a row. "" "" At the time of the transaction, my personal information is not disclosed, but my personal information and my purse is bound.However, using additional methods of hiding IP addresses or using overseas servers or exchanges that are difficult to investigate and coordinate with will make identification difficult. Eo Jun-seon said, "" As any exchange checks itself when liquidizing Bitcone, if we work together with global experts, we can track the users by nearly 100 percent, but some countries do not have good cooperation with us. ""The possibility of a single currency becoming reality is darker than that of an all-out replacement for existing currencies. The biggest obstacle is the higher value variability. Professor Hong Ki-hoon said, It is hard to seriously examine the bills because the Bitcone prices are changing in real time at the moment, and pointed out that although they are volatile, they tend to increase in value. "" Inflation, the monetary depreciation, is what people are going to spend on. On the other hand, if you say you can buy a cup of coffee today and two cups tomorrow with the bit coin you have, who's going to use it as a currency? On the one hand, it's not very predictable when the price will go down, so you'd rather have it exchanged for won, and that would make it an unstable asset. "" Technology, that's too long to approve transactions. Because the block chain is taking about 10 minutes to form, the money is not immediately good for immediate transactions. Kim Jin-hwa, co-president of the Korea Block Chain Association, said, "" Credit card payment methods are capable of processing 2,000 to 5,000 transactions per second, but Bitcone is not eligible to handle seven transactions immediately because it is a distributed system. "" As the level of mining difficulty continues to rise, the transaction fee could increase significantly in the future if profit is not realized. Another limitation is that the understanding of related technologies is essential and therefore can lead to an information gap among the underprivileged. To improve long approval times, some exchanges are being made in an off-chain, off-chain manner, rather than in a block chain, that is, with the exchanges writing down only on the inside pages of the exchanges. However, that would lead to other security, manipulation and fraud, and closure of the exchange. Thanks to the block chain, the problem of security and hacking that was avoided is reemphasized when the off-chain method was adopted.While widely announcing Bitcoin as Korea`s first co-operator of the crypto-cash exchange Cobbit, Chairman Kim should be cautious of rosy prospects of imagining a universal key that would replace all existing trading methods. Earlier cases of bit coins being used in Switzerland or Japan were called "" trendy. "" But I believe it could serve as a financial asset, such as a limited trading tool and gold, although it has limitations as a currency, he predicted.

"Chinese and Italian scientists have successfully transplanted one head to another with two human corpses.

Professor Canabero explained to the other the body the nerves and blood vessels with biological glue known as PEG, after cutting the head off of one of the bodies, saying the procedure was carried out in two stages.`` It has been proven to be successful by nerve stimulation, '' he stressed, `` the two people are perfectly attached.

According to the National Assembly's Strategy and Finance Committee on July 18, the number of tax investigations into public institutions from 2012 to last year totaled 110. The National Tax Service decided to impose a total of 1,469.7 billion won in tax imposition after detecting missing persons, with the average tax amount of 13 billion won per case. Tax investigations by public institutions (additional tax amount : 59.6 billion won) were carried out in 2012, 21 cases in 2013 (24.4 billion won), 23 cases in 2014 (204.5 billion won), and 27 cases in 2015 (468.5 billion won).

The ministry revised the building law and approved the use of buildings with a total floor area of 16 or higher or with a total floor area of 5,000 ㎡ (completed) shortly after the Gyeongju earthquake hit last September. Seismic capability is classified to 12 classes of ' seismic intensity ' (magnitude of ground shaking). Richter magnitude (energy size at ground origin) 5.0 to 5.9 earthquake is magnitude 6 to 7, and 6.0 to 6.9 earthquakes are magnitude 8 to 9. For example, an apartment with a sixteen-story building means that it can withstand earthquakes less than 6.0. Previously, simple seismic design applications could only be identified in the building register, and the ' performance ' of a building was not known to be specific. The government's policy reflects criticism that the targets for the disclosure are too limited to be effective. Currently, the mandatory anti-seismic design target range is for buildings with two or more floors or with a gross floor area of 500 ㎡ or higher, while those with anti-seismic capability of 16 or more floors or with a total area of 5,000 ㎡ or higher. Freedom Party Rep. Park Chan-woo said, We should exclude the lowest-rise building that is most vulnerable to earthquakes from being unveiled in Pohang, just one year after the earthquake. First, the ministry will push for the improvement of the system based on a revision to the building law that Park proposed last September. The revision adjusted the scope of capability disclosure to the current aseismic design mandatory range (level 2 or higher). We will change the scope of the bill`s revision to that of all homes, which is mandatory, so it can be discussed at the regular session of the National Assembly, a ministry official said.

"Shim Dang-gil's 14 Borrows, Shim Soo-gwan's Interview with Shim Soo-gwan, and Shim Soo-gwan's "" Four 400 Years of Back "" at the Dong-bo Il-min Gallery in 1998 are saying, "" I've been in an adventure. Even the pottery we had made from our ancestors had to go to my hometown if I had a soul. Shim Soo-kwan (Kagoshima Prefecture) = Seo Young-ah, correspondent of the show, "" Maybe it's autumn in Korea. If I could see it one more time ... "" I miss the clear, clear, and lonely fall weather, and I don't know if I can make it again. The descendants of potters who were brought from Namwon, North Jeolla Province, during the time of the reign of Jeong Yu-jae in 1598 have lived here for over 400 years. It is still a secluded spot that leaves from Kagoshima Airport every two hours only when you take a taxi again.All I have accomplished is my father`s dream, he said, 14 of the bad debts Simdang-gil, who was dragged from the Joseon Dynasty over 400 years ago. Shim Soo-gwan is currently a member of Kagoshima Prefecture and has been treated as a familiarist and made pottery by hand. He is one of the most famous Japanese pottery market. Since the Meiji Restoration when the 12th Shim Soo-gwan was honored, the descendants have succeeded. Born in 1926, people in their 14th teens still visit the bird almost every day. After she passed away in 1999, she lived with her dog Kotaro in a nearby house. Kiyohara Masako, the oldest daughter, stops by every day to eat and live. The 14th century was also widely known as the main character of the novel "" How to Forget My Country, "" written by writer Shiva Ryotaro (1969). He says what he did in his life was actually the process of achieving the dream of his father's 13-something. "" That Novori sedan, the stairway oven on the slope, the stand-in height, and the workshops were all 13 aspirations. (Father) It was difficult until his death in 1964. If I had enough money, I would do this, and I would do that ... I grew up with such a story that I said, "" It was very kind of you to grow the goodwill and advice of Shiba Ryotaro, the greatest intellectuals and author of the time. The author advised him to make a work worth about a month's salary for an average person. In early 1970, when he was free, he first built a Japanese tea room. To make the proper dining room, the design was left to Urasenke, the main hall of Dado. After Shiva told the media, Japanese provinces had such a big talk : If you don`t drink tea from the Shim Soo-kwan, you will not be a dicky. "" When they come (when they come for tea), they don't just go. My tea service cost was about 30,000 yen, and as a result of my shopping, the price went up to 90,000 yen, "" said one ceramic pot, one of the fifteen brands of marketing. The Shim Soo-gwan was busy preparing for the "" Miyama pottery, "" which was several days away. [2] The twelve ' Baeksatsuma ' pieces on display in the past collection department. Only the ones with flaws in the manufacturing process were left in the Shim Soo-gwan Street. [3] The value of Shim Soo-gwan rose as correspondent Seo Young-ah grew more intergrammed with leading Japanese culture people. So, he completed the collection to pay off the debts of his forebears, build more gama, build workshops, and preserve works handed down from father to father. The two-story water-high building was built strongly to withstand an earthquake. The first Simdang-gil exhibit works by ancestors, including Hibakari, which is Joseon's, and Dawan, which means only Japan's. His anecdote is a good account of how much the family's longing was in the water-call completed in 1980. "" About 80 percent of the construction was going on, and my mother was in the hospital and continued to let it go. I took her in my car, and took her to a building under construction, behind the scenes. My mother suddenly asked me to let her down, stood on her shaky leg, and cried for three cheers. And then I sat down and I began to cry. Mom's dream was just like Dad's. As we drove back to the hospital, my mother was in a heartbeat, and she said, "" My father's 13 years of age have passed since he graduated from Kyoto University and lived at the law school. The times were complicated by war. When my fiery son said at the end of the war, "" I want to go to the military school like my friends, "" the father said, pointing to the trees in the yard. `` They don't live here because they want to. She would have grown free in the mountains and the fields. But now I try my best to live in a serious place. We are like that tree. "" This gave him a full understanding of the potters ' lives."" Son, please take good care of 1998. "" My father's dying will in 1964 was the 400th anniversary of his arrival here. I look forward to the time. During the next three decades, he spent thinking and preparing how to celebrate the 400th anniversary of SatsumayakI's introduction. My first dream is to bring the Fire of Joseon to Miyama. My early ancestors used the clay and techniques of Joseon to call the bowls of Japanese pottery Hibakari, but this time, I brought home the soil and fire of my hometown. Eventually, he brought the charcoal from Namwon to Miyama in 1998. The embers still burn in the Maya gas station. Another was the home-coming exhibition. Even pottery from a water-high school that had never left Kagoshima before the first time, so they planned an exhibition in Seoul, hoping to miss their home. The dream was finally fulfilled with the ' Simsugwangjeon Family, ' which was built in Japan in 400 years, at the Ilmin Museum of Art in Donga Ilbo, July 1998. About 50,000 people attended the event for five weeks. "" The exhibition was actually a great adventure for me. Before the event, I was so worried that I couldn't sleep well for several months. "" When the Korean exhibition was unveiled, local media fiercely protested. About 140 points of the head of the water storage house is the only collection that can tell the history of SatsumayakI, and they were concerned that they could lose the entire thing in the event of an accident. It was the first and last time that the Shim Soo-gwan's ancestors had left Miyama entirely. On the night of the successful end of the 400-year-old, he stared at his son eating and drinking, who had stopped drinking before the event. He was 39 years old when he was a son. He also succeeded to the party at the age of 38. I will resign from the front line after handing over my family shares next year, declared the statement. He was 72 years old. These days, he says, "" I've done my life's work since I turned ninety. "" "" Up to the age of 16, my grandson is in a Dodo. After that, I leave it to my 15 generations to see how I can prepare : "" Culture shines when I have someone I understand. "" "" Korean pottery bloomed in Japan, "" I asked him, "" The Dodappo in Japan. "" He explained that thanks to the tea ceremony, Japanese people started to think of pottery as a diamond, and they were able to produce potters. Tea culture started in China and went to Japan via the Korean Peninsula, but Japan turned it into a province. During the Japanese Invasion of Korea in the time of the reign of King Dado, Dawan of Joseon was worth exchanging for one of the castles. That is why the Imjin war is called the "" pottery war. "" The works of Joseon potters entered the Paris World Exposition in 1867 and surprised the West. Since then, SatsumayakI has been exported to the world by gaining fame. The potters Joseon used to entertain the pleasure of Japan, and the artisans who refined the techniques in those environments inspired the Japanese art world in the early 19th and 20th centuries by encouraging the Japanese culture to flourish in Western Europe. It is an ironic cycle that Japan's modernization and accumulation of wealth has led to imperialism in the end.What does that mean? People in their 14th century were told that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's family came from the Korean Peninsula. From Satō Eisaku (佐 藤 榮 作 )) who served as prime minister from 1964 to 1972. Even now, HwI-ho, written by former Prime Minister Sato, is hung on his living room. The inscription ‘ MujisikjI ’ is signed by Shim Soo-gwan and the sign ‘ Haisaku in the Spring of the gap nyeon 默 之 ’. The year of the birth means 1974. Those in their 14th generation remember the day when former Prime Minister Sato wrote down the HwI-ho as if it were yesterday. After being treated to a car, former Prime Minister Sato said, It is a good car, and asked, How many generations have you been, Wang-su? "" I'm in my 14th generation, "" he said. "" I think I'll be a little shorter. You came to Guicho when it was 1200-1596-1615, and I think our ancestors came after that. Then, they wrote letters to him asking for brushes and ink. MujisinjI means to recognize and understand everything that you need not say. Regarding this, the 14th generation people said, We have not really discussed the authenticity of the remarks, but I think it is possible for Prime Minister Sato's hometown Yamaguchi to interact with the Korean Peninsula, since it has long been the most active area. Eisaku Sato is the brother of Nobusuke KishI, the grandfather of current Prime Minister Abe's mother. He died in 1975.The positive root causes improvement and he says he can not forget his first visit to Korea. Around November, 1965, I went to Busan by boat and spent one night in Daegu, Daejeon, and Seoul. Countless people I met on my way to the shabby daposetting. Everyone would hear of him and they would say, "" What a pity you've been back in 400 years .... "" and "" Welcome to the glass. And first time I saw Han River. My heart was in it. "" From a young age, I grew up hearing that the Han River is the biggest and most beautiful river in the world. From the forecourt to the home country"
"I grew up with a sense of pride and pride in my family, and I think strong optimism about my roots also gave me a talk at Seoul National University at the time. It was a time when the universities were in a turmoil due to the opposition to normalization of diplomatic relations between Korea and Japan. The 14th generation is ready to get eggs and say, "" If you're talking about one in 36 years, I have to say one in 360. But that is not the way to move into the future. "" The lecture hall was relieved for a moment. But then someone stood up and began to sing "" The Man in the Yellow Shath. "" Then everyone stood up, sang and walked toward the stage. The professor who invited me came up in tears and hugged me. Students also hugged on it. I could not hold back my tears. "" Since my last visit to Korea in February 2013, I have been unable to move to Korea. "" I still dream of my last journey. I'd like to rent a taxi with a Japanese-speaking driver and go all over the country to say goodbye to my family. I always think about it, but I can only think of it : "" Seo Young-ah, correspondent of the Korea-Japan Empowerment of Economic Relations, Facebook sya@donga.com ※ Top 14 Shim Soo-gwan, 1908’s, honorary consul general at Japan's Waseda University, and politics, 1908 2008h, 1964 ● The revision, which was handled by the management committee, currently reduces the number of internships at each National Assembly office to one and provides an additional 8-class special civil servant position. The National Assembly's management committee explained that the measure was taken because the National Assembly guidelines require that irregular interns be dismissed if they fail to work for more than two years starting next year. The purpose of the bill is to reduce layoffs by absorbing internships at the increased staff level. Park Hong-keun, a fisherman's lawmaker, told the commission that many talented internships are needed, with 88 students sacked in January next year and 256, about 46 percent of them fired by the end of the year. Currently, National Assembly aides have two senior secretaries, two fifth secretaries and one sixth, seventh and ninth secretaries, all of whom are seven. If the revision passes the National Assembly's plenary session, the number of secretaries will increase to eight. The revision did not include raising one of the two senior secretaries that they had originally promoted to the third level. Regarding this, some say the ruling and opposition parties have sharply opposed the decision to hire more government officials, and the increasing number of aides were handled without any word because of their mutual interests.

The North Korean government has decided to concentrate on the hot economic issues and retaking process. In particular, it is a clear question as to whether the key suspect, the North Korean military pursuit team, has fired into the south of the MDL, and whether some of its chasing units have crossed the MDL, which should be clearly identified as part of the North Korea's military disclosure. Some footage was released as the United Nations Command announced the results of its investigation soon. According to Yoo Kwang-seok, a reporter. The CCTV`s managed to capture most of North Korea's troop defection, according to reports.

This is Yoo Kwang-seok from KBS news.Yoo Kwang-seok : Please make friends with KBS news (ksyoo@kbs.co.kr) However, questions are growing as to why the cancer-caused bodies have not been found.The May 17 Memorial Foundation held a press conference and released the records of the prosecution's investigation records on May 18, 1980, including documents and messages from the prosecutors ' office in Gwangju.According to a report on the Gwangju District Public Prosecutors ` Office on May 22, 1980, the military units set up six bodies of the bodies at a cemetery near Gwangju Prison on May 21, 2008.Also, a message from the Gwangju District Public Prosecutors ` Office sent to Gwangju on May 24 read, We will consult with military authorities on the disclosure of the bodies buried near your cemetery May 21.The documents were recently discovered with the records of prosecutors ` office submitted to the 1995 trial of Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo.The cemetery site is an area outside the old prison on the 6th section of the road that runs from Gakhwa-dong, Buk-gu to Munheung. It is about 100 meters from the wall in the north, where excavation research is being conducted.▽ Field Survey of the Special Committee on Gwangju, 1989 = It is presumed that the cemetery of the combined Newsweet Prison was built as the place where the body of a dead condemned criminal was buried.As the road was built, excavation was carried out at a part of the cemetery site, and the seventh burial site was moved to another location. The death row was erected on the remaining grave of the cemetery.The foundation speculates that if remains missing from the cemetery, it is most likely the body of a civilian victim who was buried in a burial site at the time of May 18.The May 18th Foundation is planning to check the site and make a dig plan with retired prison officers who used to manage the former cemetery.The foundation also introduced a tip on the sale of cancer cells to soldiers who were stationed at the Gwangju Prison. Former commander Shin Soon-yong, a former commander of a 3-car 11 battalion unit, and Yoo, who retired as a sergeant at the headquarters battalion, said, "" The excavation site is not a sale site they have seen or participated in. ""On May 15, the May 18 Memorial Foundation conducted a field investigation to find traces of May 18 civilian victims in the basement of a tower located in Munheung-dong, Buk-gu, Gwangju. The photo shows the inside of a tower's basement where suspicion is raised that the bodies of the May 18 victims were buried and buried in concrete.The foundation will closely investigate pine forest around the house of a warden of a prison south of Seoul on May 22, 1980, based on a tip from Lee, who allegedly buried five bodies as soldiers in the 3rd Airborne 11 Battalion.In 1989, when the parliamentary special committee on Gwangju decided to investigate into the area, it was pointed out as a "" female burial place "" in an old prison, but it was not an exact excavation project.The foundation has expanded its policy to develop the land where it expects the results of the GPC-Ground Testing Radar investigation to come out on July 20.Cars with a ground search radar (GP) are entering a suspected site for a rock burial site yesterday near the wall of a former Gwangju prison south of Munheung-dong, Buk-gu, Gwangju, Korea.Photo : There were a string of reports by the royal guards that they had put up or witnessed a female burial in or outside of the prison in Gwangju, but they have not yet discovered the bodies.The foundation did not see any unusual signs in the first and first expanded sections of the excavation project at the Gwangju Prison, which began on July 6. No bodies were found. May 18, 2008, was most likely the group moved to another location after being attacked by a she-de-do. The fact that the Kye-eum County went back to Gwangju within a month or two after the May 18th Democratic Movement supports this possibility. Kim Yang-rae, executive director of the Foundation, said, As the digging process grows longer, we are concerned about the accumulated fatigue, adding, It is regrettable that some people have specific records and buried them without finding their victims.As social attention is focusing on the issue, new evidence is emerging, Kim said, We need to get active testimony from those involved in the sale.Gwangju : Correspondent Han Hyun-mook hanshim@segye.com ⓒ ilbo The Eye to View the World, The Global Media Daily"

"▽ Open recruitment = Thousands of people could not get the information to work, so the part-timer who worked at the citrus farm in Seogwipo, Jeju Island, came from Taebaek, Gangwon Province. The part-timer starts at 8 a.m. and works until 5 p.m./ If you visit National Agricultural Cooperative Federation in Jeju, you can get not only room and board but also pay for the flight, said Kim Cheol-hwan, 47, a part-timer of tangerine farmers who borrowed from Taebaek this year. This is because the only oranges at a 10,000-square-meter farm were one of her 72-year-old mother and her daughter Kim. The full citrus harvest season is from November 10 to December 20 and requires you to pick all oranges on 1,000 citrus trees in between. Until two years ago, they got workers from a human resource firm, but last year, they had more oranges than usual, they had a hard time finding people. This year, the number of fruit is smaller than last year, but the two working together can not pick oranges within the time frame. If oranges are not picked by the end of this year, they could suffer from cold weather and damage for the year.Kim hired an alang-picking buyer from Jeju Island and the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation this year. If you work on citrus harvest, you can stay at 60,000 won per day. If you work more than 10 days in a row, you can get a round-trip plane ticket to someone who works one way or 20 days straight, the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation said. So far, more than 3,000 people have applied. It is really hard to find anyone who can pick oranges from Jeju Island, and I thank you for being so easily staffed, Kim said, I think we can supply the oranges on a schedule this year.One of the reasons why Jeju citrus harvest is short-handed is so much work is done is because the entire process requires human effort. Officials with Jeju Provincial Government's citrus promotion department said, "" Because other crops need less hands because they can be grown and planted in whole or in part, they need less hands. "" All citrus crops, although they are by example and now useless. This means that a person cuts the ears of an orange with scissors, divides it by size, and packs it in a box.Another reason is the fact that with the development boom in Jeju, all of the citrus harvest workers have moved to the provincial cities. An official at the Jeju National Agricultural Cooperative Federation said, "" In the past, people in their 20s used to come to work as part time jobs for oranges during the harvest season, but now they are looking for oranges at convenience stores or cafes, "" adding, "" It is hard to look into their 20s. "" An official at Jeju Island said, We use a lot of women to pick oranges, but with more women working in the cities as stay-at-home moms, it is difficult to find workers during the harvest season.Jeju Island and the Jeju National Agricultural Cooperative Federation have called for part-time jobs until they are under extreme conditions because citrus farms can not find people outside of Jeju Island themselves. There are a total of 31,155 farms selling citrus fruits in Jeju Island, with most farmers in their 60s and older. They can find ways to recruit people other than by contacting a labor force company. Some farmers even made up for their shortfall by selling their own citrus harvest experience online.Thousands of applicants for the citrus fruit picking group have flocked, but farmers remain troubled. One citrus farmer said, "" We can not afford to do citrus harvest roughly, "" adding, "" You provide airfare and accommodation.[Kim Soo-kyung, reporter of Doosong.com] - Compritations ilbo Chosun Ilbo & Chosun.com, No unauthorized copying and redistribution - < Anchor > Korean missile defense system for medium - As the nation's hard developed high-tech weaponry is on the brink of disruption, many say they can't be understood, and today's military authorities decided to go back in with an M-SAT.First, I am Kim Tae-hun, a reporter specializing in defense.[Press > Armed Forces Day] Korean medium-range interceptor missile M-SAT was introduced as a major exponent of Korean advanced weapons.[Bottoms up!

So why did you say that you could initially hold off and stop producing?< Journalists > M-SAM are domestic weapons that have been successfully developed and are responsible for nearly half of the Korean missile defense system, so few doubted about mass production and early power generation.Still, Minister Song Young-moo said, "" M-SAT is very expensive for performance, "" adding, "" It's an aging weapon that will soon be phased out, and he hinted at the possibility of introducing an alternative weapon. ""And there were a lot of people saying, "" What is that foreign weapon? "" And the SM-3, which is called the THAAD in the sea, was the most interesting.Aren't you suggesting that you are selling high-tech weapons made in Korea that you tried to introduce SM-3?Speaking by Rep. Kim Jong-dang of the ruling Democratic Party, the U.S. Marine Based Interference Weapon SM-3 stressed the need for adoption by Minister Song Young-moo several times.Trump Since back and said it would sell advanced weapons is with the United States is president again.However, there were many military and civil defense groups that pointed out this problem several times, including the fact that the company should buy SM-3 while closing its hard-developed domestic business with Japan.Most of all, we needed a clear explanation that the people and soldiers could understand, and that was not the case at all.Does it mean that the possibility of introducing S-3 is gone?First of all, the North Korean short-range missiles alone are more than 1,000.We need at least a thousand of interceptors.And without M-SAM, the South Korean military has only about five hundred interceptor missiles capable of catching North Korean ballistic missiles.But the SM-3 costs 15 to 20 billion won per shot in interceptor missiles. It's too expensive to live in.SM-3 has an intercept altitude of more than 150 kilometers, but most of North Korea's flagship Scud missiles are flying at speeds of less than 150 kilometers per hour.In addition, it could provoke controversy over the U.S.'s annexation of the MD system, so it would be necessary to carefully assess the issue, even if there is a U.S. demand for it.( Report : Kim Hyun-jong, video editing : Woo Ki-jung, journalist of Seisong Taehoon (oneway@sbs.co.kr) [Finance of Earthquakes : [Unforgetted and SBS] The presence of fear in Cheong Wa Dae …"
"123 Youth Restorements…I don't understand why 56 percent of retreats won't be able to get into the streets on their own. "" "" Smoking restrictions, teen stoppers, and running away from home if it's too cold. I'd like to stay outside, but when it gets colder, I'll look for a place to go. "" Lee, 17, who left home about six months ago, argued with his parents at his house in Uijeongbu, Gyeonggi Province and lived on the streets. I spend the night going back and forth between my friends home, sauna and PC room. If they make money with part-time jobs and delivery jobs, but find nowhere to go, runaways can find a place to stay. Lee said, We have been to about five shelters until now, but the rules were strict and we could not find one day at a time. If we don`t like the rest, we have other information to run away from home. Like Lee, the young people who move around the rest area are called "" Swimdori, Shimsun, "" or "" Shimsun, "" among runaway teenagers.Kim Hee-jae, head of a mobile refuge for teenagers who run away from home, Dongdaemun and Cheonho in Seoul, said, "" Kids are used to this experience and need to stay in a rest area to avoid this kind of information, "" adding, "" I hope they will find a safe shelter for their parentsThere are 123 teen shelters nationwide, which is a youth protection facility to be retreated into the streets. The government pilot project started in 1992 at the YMCA Youth Service in Seoul, but increased the number of runaway teenagers since the IMF financial crisis, which led to more shelters in metropolitan areas. Youth rest areas are divided into ▲ number of days (24 hours to 7 days) and ▲ number of short months (3 months basic detection and temporary protection) and 3 years of rehabilitation programs (counseling and social rehabilitation programs). Ten buses are also operated to provide a portable rest area with a bus with 45 seat change and consultation facilities. Under the Framework Act on Adolescence, from the age of 9 to 24, young residents can choose and enter the rest area regardless of their location. Last year, 32,329 teenagers, twice the number of teenagers who ran away from home in 2013, visited a rest area for teenagers. It was used by 21,168 people until the end of September this year.While the number of runaway teenagers who visit teen shelters increases steadily, about half of them are left out of the rest areas by themselves and are left unattended. According to the report on July 3, more than half of the total number of female residents in Korea's National Assembly and Rural Community Affairs Committee (Dubul Minjoo Party) who requested to return to their home centers by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family were found to be more than 25.56 % who retired last year from youth shelters. Park pointed out, "" More than half of the teenagers who leave their homes to look for shelter in crisis situations due to domestic abuse and violence have problems operating themselves. ""Only 254 people (0.9 percent) are forced to leave because the protection period set for each youth shelter has expired. As to why they would choose to go to the streets and avoid accommodation and accommodation, teenage counselors and social workers who were running away from home and living in shelters "" weren't used to it at all, "" they said, "" in the end, a little bit of a crowd.There are differences between shelters, but most of the regulations are related to smoking. ' Smoking is provided three times a day, morning, afternoon, or evening, ' ' Going home to bed at 9 p.m. on weekdays and Sundays, and using smartphones until 10 p.m. on Saturdays ' With only a few of these rules in mind, children who are free to move around the streets often regard themselves as fetters. Park Eun-ju, head of the counseling team at Geumcheon Youth Center in Seoul, said, There are often children who come to visit the shelter when they explain the rules of shelter. Even romantic relationships are a hindrance to staying in rest areas. Most of the shelters run separate groups of male and female teenagers. Some children might choose to go to the streets because they feel uncomfortable meeting their girlfriends at other shelters due to the different curfew hours.Even though they were always searching for a shelter they liked, one teenage worker in Seoul was once called to police station. The people who called are runaway teenagers who were staying at the shelter. According to the rules of the shelter, when they checked out on the weekend, they reported that welfare facilities held minors in custody. These teens need to get out of the rest area and look for something else, but needn't be too much trouble. You can just leave a message in an online café with runaway teenagers or in a group Kakao Talk room. "" Now, the A rest area has rules that are so strict and uncomfortable, where should it be? Or can anyone help you? I went to Katok, a group of 80 runaway teenagers, and saw what they were saying. Sources have been heard about the shelter they experienced. "" In Seoul, many children used to go out to the Sillim, so we don't want to have a girl running away from home if we can. ""As they seek information on rest areas online, the range of runaway teenagers has become wider. Kim Ki-nam, president of the Youth Rest Council, said, "" Before using smartphones, runaway teenagers used to share information in areas that were not far from their daily lives, but now they know which shelter they should go to and where they should go. "" Children who can not pay for their calls are said to contact each other via text message where Wi-Fi is available.Most of the 17 teenagers who live at the Geumcheon Youth Center are from outside Seoul. Park said that teenage runaways who try to leave the home often feel more secure than physical, and that he or she should consider going to different rest areas to avoid arrest. Last year, more than 30,000 people took refuge, but the number of runaway teenagers who were placed in the blind spot is still much higher.The youth shelter and runaway Pam (living together as a group of runaway teenagers) compete for the runaway teenagers who refused to take to shelter. Rest areas provide information and guide visitors through street counseling and online counseling, but runaway teenagers often show an interest in runaway Pam. Chairman Kim of the Youth Protection Council recently extended online counseling to allow people to enter shelters before entering runaway Pam, but there are often occasions when there is little knowledge of shelters or distrust of public institutions. Joo Jae-hyun, director of the Youth Self-Support Support Division at the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, said, There are rare ways to live together with congenial teens, but usually girls are forced to meet conditions and boys are forced to work part-time.Experts say that while it is best for runaway teenagers to return to society in order of the number of temporary to short-term or mid to long-term rest places, they are lucky to have runaway teenagers who are in immediate danger become sleepoles and stimps. Choi Soon-jong, a junior studies professor at Kyung-kyung University, said, "" For the short term, teenagers who seek shelter are willing to return to their homes and society, "" adding, "" The rest of the victims are likely to be the ones who refuse to be the shelter. ""According to the "" status of teen resitters who have been readmitted by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, "" Kim Seung-hee (National Unification, the ruling Grand National Party and the National Assembly's Committee for Women's Family Affairs), 13 to 16 percent of the residents who have run away from home during the past three years. In other words, they could not endure living in a shelter and went out into the street again. We need to carefully analyze the reasons for leaving and reentering the detention center so that the teenagers who visit the shelter do not go back to the streets, Kim said.The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family and the Youth Protection Council is in charge of the intensive street counseling for runaway teenagers during the vacation season and the CSAT every summer. Youth shelters are like emergency rooms for runaway teenagers, said Kim Ki-nam, head of the association of Youth Rest and Rest at any time.[Lee Jeong-koo Press.com Direct to Dooson.com] - Compritations ilbo Chosun Ilbo & chosun.com, No unauthorised reproduction or redistribution"

Some media outlets have already adopted robotic journalism, which uses AI to write short news articles on the weather, natural disasters, stock market trends and the outcome of the Games.In addition, industrial designers are classified as high-risk, more automative occupational groups.All of these occupational groups have one thing in common : they work according to a set algorithm. The ability to do these tasks is very hard for a human being to survive in the competition with a computer because it is superior to humans.And U.S. futurist Martin Ford stated in his book Rise of the Robots : Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future that the telemarketer is highly automated and predictablePwC report forecasts AI will replace drivers and factory workers in 20 years, and Professor Frey and Osborne have predicted automated real estate operations that will allow computers to perform better than humans.However, there are many jobs that are less likely to be replaced even when AI robots appear.According to the papers of Prey`s and Osborne, the possibility of replacing dentists, nutritionists, fitness trainers, elementary teachers, recreation instructors and firefighters with computers is less than 1 percent.These jobs require human ingenuity, intuition, emotion intelligence, and use unique human characteristics such as manual tasks and physical labor, and face to face work. These tasks can not be performed by computer software without decision making capabilities. Therefore, experts analyzed that it is relatively safe in the face of automation.Ford said, "" Jobs that require creativity, such as artists and scientists, or jobs that need closer relationships with customers, are hard to automate.

"" While special envoy of Chinese President Xi Jinping is in Pyongyang focusing on the North Korean nuclear negotiations, the U.S. and North Korea are engaged in a war of nerves, refusing to budge. Secretary of State Tillerson told a conference in Washington D.C. that `` the only way North Korea can truly secure its security is to choose what is meant by dialogue on the other side, apart from the current line. '' African countries were urged to carry out the U.N. Security Council's resolution to impose sanctions on North Korea. It also called for a reduction in diplomatic relations with the North Korean regime, a break in economic relations, and the expulsion of North Korean workers from the country.Even when North Korea did not make any military provocation for more than 60 days, Xi's special envoy to Pyongyang visited Pyongyang to sound out the possibility of dialogue with the North, Pyongyang continues to exert diplomatic pressure to isolate itself. Donald Trump for overwriting of state sponsors of terrorism in the U.S., the president also announced early next week to rein in pressure on Pyongyang. Earlier next week, when Xi's special envoy to North Korea is expected to return to Korea, he is expected to wait and see the results of his visit before deciding whether to reassign it. North Korean Vice Chairman Choe Ryong-hae met Songtao, head of China's Communist Party's external affairs bureau, who visited North Korea as a special envoy to President Xi Jinping, at the Mansudae Capitol in Pyongyang on July 17. There is no negotiation so long as the United States continues to play war in front of the North Korean gate and maintains a hostile policy, Han told Reuters yesterday. North Korea will also continue to increase its self-defense capability and the core of its capability is its nuclear weapons capabilities, he stressed repeatedly that he has no intention of giving up nuclear weapons. The North Korean Workers ` Party's Journal of Government Labor also wrote in a commentary on the issue of the North's anti-Communist scheme, No sanctions or pressure can work on us. Rather, it will only strengthen our strong will to fulfill the historic task of building the nation`s nuclear weapons. The previous day, we will not step back from strengthening our nuclear capability unless the United States ends its hostile policy toward North Korea, the newspaper reiterated its earlier stance not to engage in dialogue before denuclearization. It is expected that Songtao, the head of the Communist Party's liaison office in Pyongyang as a special envoy, will meet Kim Jong Un on July 19.

"Kim Seon-dong, head of the National Assembly's executive committee, is in charge of improving the parliamentary system in Yeouido, Seoul yesterday. ▽ November 17, 1717.17 / News 1 / Lee Dong-won, a news reporter, pointed out ` Naerong-Nam Bull ` and added, ` It is possible to increase the number of employees who pretended not to see mass layoffs as internships. ` The National Assembly Steering Committee held a meeting on July 17 and passed a partial revision to the law on parliamentary allowances and other benefits for lawmakers who will add one member to their staff.Currently, the number of aides who help one National Assembly member is two in fourth, second, sixth, seventh, and ninth, all of whom are seven, excluding two Interns. However, according to the revision passed by the management committee, a new eighth grade will be created and an intern will be cut by one. In other words, the number of civil servants under the National Assembly will increase by one.In a meeting, Park Hong-keun, secretary of the ruling camp of the ruling camp, said, In connection with the creation of an eight-class secretary, 88 students will be dismissed from the office in January next year, and 45 percent of all internships will occur by the end of next year. Since then, we have not been able to work at many good internships, explained Ahn Jeong-soo, who led the project. However, some are criticizing it. It is pointed out that the swift handling of the increase in aides by lawmakers while opposing the government's policy of increasing civil servants is typical of Naero-Nam-bul. Critics also say that the internships with expired are likely to be operated differently, such as hiring office workers from district offices rather than Grade 8 or 9.However, a member of the management committee stressed in a news conference call on July 18, "" It is the purpose of allowing skilled internships to work permanently "" on the revision. Regarding the effectiveness issue, he said, "" One of the Interns can be considered an excellent candidate for an eight-grade position, "" adding, "" We can add that he can be promoted from a nine-class position to an eight-level membership counselor. ""Another Moon Jae-in, said the committee, the president, irregular situation, the government released by up to zero and the government declares the roadmap to irregular workers in accordance with the policy.The situation has massive job losses anticipated in the National Assembly to make law a temporary secretary to turn a blind eye for an intern antinomy "" explained. Meanwhile, the revision, which will establish the position of secretary for the 8th degree, is expected to pass the steering committee with the consensus of the ruling and opposition parties, and therefore will easily pass the parliamentary plenary session. Lee Seung-hyeong (Pohang = Yonhap news agency), a reporter, said, "" After the 5.4 strong earthquake in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, aftershocks have died, but the refugees have not been able to live out their lives in refuge. Some of the victims who have to live in shelters due to severe damage to apartments and houses, even take their homes with them and leave. In one apartment in Buk-gu, Pohang, the residents who wanted to move to the apartment due to an earthquake were busy loading a truck with their belongings as a volunteer. The sufferers can not keep their eyes open. Although it is hard to endure living in an evacuation center for four days, there is no way to go back to the house that has become a mess and there is no room for relocation. One of the victims who was staying at the Heung-gang Gymnasium in Buk-gu said, "" I was lucky there were no aftershocks overnight, but I was surprised to think that if it was still a little bumpy or noisy here, it would be an earthquake again for now. "" The temporary refugees also often get a night's sleep out of fear of possible aftershocks and an uneasy lifestyle. Shin (64, female), who had been evacuated from the villa, said, "" I felt like I was out of the shelter the next day because my house was devastated. The aftershock was carried out 52 times until 6:57 p.m. on July 17, but has since been mild. Even during the day, the sufferers can often ask for a nap or can not easily get lost in the commotion. She walks outside the stuffy shelter because it is bright, but she enters the gym after suffering from cold winds and cold temperatures. The lowest temperature in Pohang this morning was down to 4.6 degrees Celsius and the highest temperature during the day is expected to stay below 10 degrees Celsius. Their inability to do anything under these circumstances makes them even more difficult. "" I went home yesterday because I was worried, and I was in a hell of a time because I ran out of stuff, "" said Lee (51), who didn't know how to get aftershocks again. Having to go to the shelter in a hurry with simple things to do makes basic living difficult and inconvenient. In a small space, plastic styrofoam is placed on the floor, sleeping curled up without a screen, and washing can not be tolerated. You should also wait for your turn to wash the dishes. One victim complained, I don`t know how to handle the inconvenience, but I have no choice but to endure. Due to the difficulties of daily living at shelters, many people go to homes with children, relatives, or acquaintances or leave their homes because they think they would be better off. Lee Jae-man, a Korean gym in the U.S., said, "" More than 1,000 people used to go to sports, but the number decreased to 800. Nine refuge victims, including the gymnasium, rose from 1,300 on July 15 to 1,536 on July 16 and 1,789 on July 17, but decreased to 1,361 on July 18. Pohang City is planning to spread the complaints as it complained of inconveniences and inconveniences caused by the victims of the sport, and spread them out when people got cold without protection.▽ Leaving Place of Life = People move out of an apartment building in northern Pohang with the help of volunteers, as the possibility of collapsing due to the earthquake is high. mshan@yna.co.kr 117.18 haru@yna.co.kr ▶ Report and inquiry (click!) ▶ Take Starbucks coffee for 400 minutes of subscription to Yonhap news channel."
