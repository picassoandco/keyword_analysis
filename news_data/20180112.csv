'' Following recent police investigations and the National Tax Service investigation, Justice Minister Park Sang-kee even referred to the abolition of the virtual currency exchange on July 11. However, some investors rushed to the presidential office`s Web site to voice their opposition to the regulation, and the presidential office even tried to appease the investors by saying, "" It will be a final decision after further discussion and coordination. "" Meanwhile, the price of virtual currency was cheap all day long.◇ Ministry of Justice "" Virtual currency is a worthless stone "" because the Justice Department views virtual currency transactions as real speculation or gambling. Minister Park Sang-gi likened virtual money to a worthless block of rock at a news conference on the day. Virtual currency transactions were called "" two people paying for a rock. "" "" Virtual money is not a value based ‘ target ’, but demand is growing and virtual currency transactions are virtually similar to speculation or gambling, "" he said.We judged the situation in Korea more seriously. It also mentioned the ' kimchi premium ' appearing on foreign media outlets, which refers to the distribution of virtual bills at a higher price in Korea than in other countries. It is caused by excessive speculative demand in Korea. `` It's an international assessment that the domestic virtual currency market is abnormal, '' Minister Park said. `` The money needed to be disbursed into industrial capitalization, and the losses that individuals would inevitably lose if the bubble burst. ''Park also partially denied that virtual currency investment contributes to the development of the block chain technologies, which store virtual currency transactions simultaneously on numerous computers connected to the Internet. The argument that block chains are going to develop through virtual currency transactions is misleading for the problem, he said.◇ The virtual currency market, which has been teetering all day, has been shaking a lot every time the government opened its mouth. Bitchine was traded in the domestic exchange on a COBIT basis for 21 million won per bit. However, panic has occurred after Minister Park Sang-kee's remarks on the virtual currency exchange were revealed. Bitcone, who was moving in the 11 a.m. to 2.1 million won range, dropped to the 1.5 million won range at 1:45 p.m., according to Park. It is a sharp decline of more than 25 percent. Bitcone recovered to the 20 million won range after 5 p.m. on the back of an influx of investors seeking bargains, but was less expensive in its "" fate "" matrix.The price rebound was made by Yun Young-chan, senior presidential secretary for public communication, in Seoul. At around 5:20 p.m., Yoon told reporters at the gate, It is not a clear matter to scrap the virtual currency exchange. The ministry put a stop to the policy. Bitcone, which had dropped to 2,200,000 won, moved up a bit with the remark and took a step toward the box. As of 7 p.m., the coin market moved around the 6.6,000-won range.◇ Minister of Government Departments ' confusion Park Sang-kee said on the same day, The special law measures have been set up without any conflict between ministries (at the current level of the Justice) and will be enforced soon.A citizen watches electronic boards with virtual currency prices on the virtual currency exchange in Mugyo-dong, Seoul, Tuesday. As the Ministry of Justice announced its regulations such as closing down virtual currency exchange, the price of virtual currency plummeted. Unconfident investors poured out complaints as they posted them on the public petition board of Cheong Wa Dae. / Guest Editorial Writer Choi Jong-koo also attended the National Assembly's 4th Special Committee on the Industrial Revolution, saying, "" The minister's remarks were coordinated between ministries and were in harmony with each other. "" However, unlike Minister Park's promise that it would be implemented immediately, it is a long-term project. Choi said, I believe legislation is needed to alleviate the overheated phenomenon under the current law and possibly close the market if such transactions continue in the long run.The Strategy and Finance Ministry, which is the head of the nation`s economic policies, is cautious. We have not yet reached a unified stance within the government and need further discussion, said a senior ministry official.Meanwhile, a petition against the regulation of virtual currency was posted on the Presidential petition website, and the government's attitude changed as opposition from investors intensified. The presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae has launched the project. Chief Minister Yoon Young-chan dismissed the ministry`s plan to scrap the virtual currency exchange, saying Park`s statement is one of the measures that has been prepared by the Justice Ministry. When Yoon's remarks were revealed, the ministry hurriedly released the data around 6:16 p.m. and said, "" We will lower the level of special laws to close the virtual currency exchange by consulting with related ministries. "" Minister Park confidently said that a special law was set to be enacted without any problems between ministries, but he ended up pushing for it after more than seven hours.[New Journal : [Welcome to the Chosun Ilbo : Getting into the commercial market] [Welcome to the Chosun Ilbo's subscription list] - Complications ' Daily News Agency and Virtual Account Redistributions banghc@chosun.com] The authorities at yatoya@yna.co.kr"" said, `` Investors should take responsibility for investor damages and bubble effects … "" Kim Kyung-yoon, a reporter at Yonhap News Agency, said, "" Commercial banks will not fall into confusion with their real names. Commercial banks such as Shinhan Bank and Industrial Bank announced on July 12 that they would gradually close their existing virtual accounts without introducing a virtual account verification service. KB Kookmin Bank and KEB Hana Bank are also showing cautious attitudes as they are confused over the virtual currency. The company said it will not start providing virtual account services until a policy is decided on. Against this backdrop, the banks ` move was met with embarrassment from their industries, including the Korea Exchange. Currently, the nation's largest virtual currency exchange, which receives virtual accounts from Shinhan Bank, is investigating the situation without receiving a sharp number of transactions. Rain is currently receiving virtual accounts from Shinhan and NHCF banks. However, the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (Nonghyup) is also reportedly considering ways to block deposits into existing virtual accounts, which could disrupt the inflow of new funds and transactions. We are also watching the situation, an official at the Korea Exchange explained. The Korea Block Chain Association Preparation Committee, to which the major exchanges such as Bitsham, Cobbitt and Upbit were affiliated, raised the question of whether the exchange would be able to close down or withdraw its virtual account services when it was made freely regulated by coordination with authorities. Chairman of the Block Chain Association Kim Jin-hwa said, We had to provide more self-assigned teller services starting Jan. 1 under a self-regulating policy, and the government explained later. Yesterday was also the case, and the authorities should take responsibility for any harm caused to virtual currency investors, balloon effects and underpass, he pointed out.[EPA : Yonhap news agency] is also receiving growing complaints from investors. A string of online community postings showed that investors were posting their intention to close Shinhan Bank's account or credit card, the first to announce the withdrawal of the virtual bank account. A total of 380,000 subscribers visited a virtual currency investor's Internet café yesterday to see 600 postings of Shinhan Bank. He cut through Shinhan Card and posted what he called an "" authentication shot. "" `` Shinhan Bank's Bit-Coin actively participated in the sanctions, and I have closed the bank's accounts, '' said Naver ID, `` We have now decided to close the bank's accounts.

However, the exact time for the suspension has not been decided yet, officials at the association added.Earlier in the day, Justice Minister Bahk Sang-key said, "" Virtual currency transactions are actually going on similar to gambling, "" adding, "" We are preparing legislation to ban transactions via the virtual currency exchange.

"" I didn't think to change the way certain products appeared at a certain time, "" Vice Chairman Cho Seong-jin said at the Convention Center in Las Vegas on July 10 (local time), "" anyone said. """" The 300, the 6, is not so good to say we are, "" Cho said, adding, "" but it is a very good product. It is a form of change that will take a long time to make or break anything else. "" The new product will make a decision when it is needed. "" Samsung decided to revise its strategy to release its premium phones twice a year with the first and second half of this year's G-Series at a similar time to Samsung's, effectively giving up its direct fight with Samsung. Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc. are known as the industry leaders, but the gap is wide enough to warrant a rival company in the smartphone segment. Samsung Electronics ` third quarter sales reached 62.05 trillion won, four times larger than LG Electronics ` 15.2241 trillion won. But Samsung`s mobile division sold 27.69 trillion won in the same period, nearly 10 times larger than LG`s 2.8077 trillion won. Profitability is not even comparable. Samsung Electronics earned 3.29 trillion won in operating profit from its mobile business in the third quarter of last year, but LG Electronics lost 375.3 billion won. Korea was mired in a deficit for the 11th consecutive quarter until the fourth quarter of last year.The market`s assessment has already been judged by LG as being a rout, compared with the battle between David and Goliath, but LG has remained firm on its strategy to win and lose against Samsung. LG Electronics, which dominated the world with feature phone hits such as "" Chocolate Phone, "" launched Optimus G in September 2012 to capture the premium phone market. After launching the ' V15 ' series in October 2015, the company launched its strategy smartphone in the second half of the year. It is the same strategy that Samsung Electronics will compete with its Galaxy S series in the first half and Galaxy Note series twice in the second half. Apple only comes out with new products once a year. Last year, an exceptional hit the 10th anniversary film, ' iPhone X. ' LG Electronics ` To-Trac Premium Phone strategy has only put a burden on profitability. LG Electronics ` mobile business unit lost 1.2 trillion won in operation in 2016. Samsung's cumulative operating losses amounted to 500 billion won in the first three quarters of last year, and offering only new products in a row without the same capacity as Samsung's helped boost development costs. Unlike Samsung, which has the competitiveness of memory semiconductors such as mobile application processor (AP), LG has a weak competitiveness of parts unit price based on external supply and demand. In fact, LG Electronics recorded more than twice its original forecast due to rising costs of components such as semiconductors in the third quarter of last year. Due to its low market share, Korea is also inferior in terms of parts costs. The company has been in a vicious cycle in which it would like to lower consumer prices but can not. Because of this, it did not exceed the consumers ' perception of Samsung phones at the same price. Things are the same this year. We expect to see a loss of around 570 billion won this year due to the unfavorable environment of rising parts costs, said Ko EuI-young, an economist at High-Investment Securities Co. In the end, Chairman Cho Seong-jin's remark is interpreted as his intention to change the rules of the game with a strategy to choose and concentrate on the situation of LG Electronics. If we cut the cost of developing new products right now, we can reduce the cost burden. Sony, which boasts of strong brand power, has also successfully shifted its fiscal 2016 surplus to a much larger deficit in smartphones since 2014, including a drastic cut in its product lineup. The latest addition of LG Electronics premium home appliance brand LG signature to smartphones is another strategy unique to LG. Chairman Cho Seong-jin said, When looking at scalability, the phones can also be turned over to signatures, hinting at the possibility of uniting premium phones with signatures instead of the V and G series."
"A story about a boy who became a snowflake boy was online on his way from China, attracting Chinese people. The boy was a child of Nongmin-Gong who went to the cities to make money, and created a sensation by exposing the harsh lives of the poor in China without filtering. According to China's official Xinhua News Agency and China Daily on July 12, recently a Chinese social media and portal site with Yunnan Province's 8th story of King Zhaotong and Bao Xianzhuan's picture was posted. Wang Puman, who lives 4.5 kilometers from school, wore thin clothes and was covered in snow and hair in a snow covering even in minus 9 degrees of cold. After walking for over an hour, my cheeks were flushed. Although he came to school shivering from the cold, he could not even melt his hands and feet because the classroom was not heated. The picture, taken by a homeroom teacher, was distributed nationwide through social media. He even got the nickname ' Snowflakes Boy. ' Wang Puman is a child of Nongmingkong, and is called as a ' children of elite ' in China. Left-on children who are left alone in rural areas often commit suicide while suffering from poverty and loneliness. China has as many as 61 million children who are active. According to her neighbors, Wangpuman, who lives in a mud hut with her grandmother and sister, usually eats rice and vegetables. Without heating equipment, they burn firewood to keep warm. `` Going to school is cold, but not hard, '' Wang said. `` It is my dream to grow up to be a policeman and catch a bad person. '' When the story of Wang Fu's heart was told, donations poured in from all over China, collecting around 300,000 yuan (50 million won) per day. Beijing : Copyright-of-the Culture Ministry's hotwash Seo Yoo-gi, Moon-gi utopian21@munhwa.com[ [Copyright munhwa.com ' The only night of military expedition in Korea ', and ' Marine assault and redistributing equipment ' are all banned from U.S. Marine Corps (subscribed for 55). The Marine Corps held an acquisition ceremony on July 10 at the first division of the Marine Corps in Pohang, transforming the Korean Surion helicopters into amphibious maneuvers to win over. The wingless Marine Corps has reined wings, said Jun Jin-gu, Marine Corps commander. But the Marine Corps still has a long way to go. It is the second time in the world that the Marine Corps is equipped with a terrible presence. Once Marine, forever Marine is struggling. The movie Saving Private Ryan (1998, director Steven Spielberg), about World War II Normandy, reveals that Marines are heavily committed to the guns and shells that were poured into German waters before they reached Normandy's Omaha beach. A machine gun from a German bunker is causing the 20-something Marines to collapse. Even ' Father's Flag ' (2006 - Clint Eastwood), which made a movie out of the Japanese invasion of Yuhwang Island (Iojima) during the Pacific War, was victims of a series of landing attempts by Marines. In the Battle of Iojima from Feb. 16-3, 1945, the United States Army struck 6821 soldiers and 9189 wounded. Until the Pacific War, the U.S. Marine had to pay dearly for landing on the coast by using human sea and air power because of the lack of a landing maneuvers helicopter. The Marine spirit of losing battle is a product of this tragedy. Having landed, there is nowhere to turn. U.S. reporter Park Kyung-min minn@joongang.co.kr] has armed the Marine Corps with high-tech weapons and mobility to reduce the sacrifice of landing operations after the war. U.S. Marines were deployed with an FA Super Hornet, and are now being converted to a vertical-takeoff F-35B. These fighter jets and attack helicopters quickly eliminate the enemy from the bunker before landing. Then, they land when they are judged safe. The officer flies directly from the landing ship to the target area via the air, such as an Osprey (MV-22) helicopter. It is also scheduled to take over the beach with a high-speed air suspension and assault vehicles. U.S. Marines are twice as likely to land in the air as at sea. A typical US Marine ship capable of carrying out these operations is the Wasp (WASP-4410th) assault landing ship. After the inter-Korean talks that collocated with the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, the Waspham is coming to the Korean Peninsula with aircraft carrier Carl Vinson to prepare for the North's provocations. Wasp, who left Hawaii earlier this month, runs an F-35B fighter. From the vessel, a stealth fighter can hit the coast of the enemy. Navy long, fifty m dokttoam waseupeuam (The 257 m) up to 25 amphibious vehicle or people landing troops and five of the Abrams tank, 1894 (aav), 68 of the transport.LCAC landing boat of the 12 large trucks, three more than 22, of Osprey helicopters carried. 22 - mv It is possible to land 2,000 troops quickly. The U.S. Marine Corps has 16 of these large amphibious ships. Less than the Wasp dokttoam (10,000 8800 t) runs a one and comes out and one more in 2020. The Marine Corps needs three. However, the Korean Marine Corps is no different from the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II. Until now, they have not even had an attack helicopter on board. The Korean Marine Corps has 28,000 troops who are next to the United States, but it lacks the means of landing. The Marines ' goal of fast 3-D jet coins is to date. Currently, the Marine Corps can land up to three battalions using even commercial vessels. That is, it should be guaranteed by the massive sacrifice of Saving Private Ryan. The Marine Corps is poised to equip itself with its own fleet by acquiring two amphibious task helicopters, the Marion, 45 years after it disbanded in 1973. The ground of the first division was blown with freezing weather, but the Marines were determined to win. It is not enough to carry out swift landing operations yet with little damage, but there is a growing hope for securing air power in the future. The Marine Corps plans to secure 28 Marine Ons by 2023. By 2026, 18 attack helicopters will be introduced. The Marine Corps aims to eventually have 36 amphibious task helicopters and 24 attack helicopters. Based on this, it plans to form an aviation group by 2021. The Marine Corps is also planning to secure an unmanned reconnaissance plane to locate the enemy. Despite the fact that the Marine Corps is behind schedule like this, the Ministry of National Defense has high expectations. North Korea's East Sea or in the West Sea in the event of the Marine Corps have that big landing plan. The Defense Ministry designated the Marine 1st Division as a task force in 2016. If the Marines land in the region behind the war-powered North Korea, they can attack the North. Because of such a burden, North Korea can not send all its troops to the battle in case of an emergency and can leave several dozen times its combat power behind. Therefore, the Marine Corps is classified as an aggressive and strategic force. Operation to land in Incheon is a typical example. According to the Defense Ministry and the Marine Corps, they are currently pushing for an offensive task force to reform the nation. The unit consists of the Marine Corps brigade, the Army airborne division and the mechanized corps. As before, they will be taking charge of the occupation of Pyongyang in the first two to three weeks of war, not the vacuum in the North, three months after all U.S. reinforcements arrive. To do so, the Marine Corps will establish a bridgehead by conducting large-scale amphibious operations along the North Korean coast. The Army's airborne divisions and mechanized corps then make inroads into the Pacific Ocean to dominate Pyongyang. If successful, the operation could lead to the beheading. The ministry is drawing up such a grand plan, but it is unclear whether the Marine Corps can make its own landing. Expansion of such ability is the first priority. The Marine Corps has many nicknames for its experience in fighting against adverse conditions since the Korean War. They say, "" The Marines Who Cheats the Ghost, "" "" The Phoenix is invincible, "" and "" I will not leave my comrades in the enemy lines. "" The Marine Corps sign says, ' Freedom and Justice. ' Marine Corps members cut their hair short to heal them quickly if they hurt it in battle. Be hungry This Marine spirit is shared by the Korean and the American nations. It is the result of a long combat with him. Recently, China and Japan also have Marines. China is currently expanding to 100,000 from 20,000 in the name of the Navy's Yukjeon University. Japan also plans to establish an amphibious task force between 2018 and 2020. Raising Marines by the day means that the military will change aggressively. We can expect a day when Marines armed with freedom and justice can secure a strong maneuver and proudly protect the national interests in Baengnyeong Island, Jeju Island, Ieodo Island and Ullung Island.

Moon Jae-in is 60 percent of the money market investors regime's main supporters, ages 20, 30 came out because they mean.Regulations against virtual currency are also increasing overseas. The Chinese government ordered the mining companies of Shinanghur and Inner Mongolia to resign because of their low electricity bills.In the United States, where Bitcone futures began trading on October 11 for the first time in the world, global investment banks such as JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, and BOA Merrill Lynch prohibit futures brokerage themselves.

At that time, the international price of Bitcone was around $ 13,000,000, down from the previous day.The price of Bitcone in the domestic market was shaken by remarks made by Minister Park all day long. Park plunged about 25 percent to the 1.5 million won range from the previous statement, but gained momentum with the influx of purchasing power. When Yoon's statement was revealed, it rose from 2.20 million won to 20 million won. Virtual money-related stocks tumbled 20-30 percent on the stock market, with the shares of Biddent and Omnitel, both of which have shares in the stock exchange, falling to rock bottom prices (- 30 %). According to the New York Post on July 10 (local time), on the Christmas day last year, Rubutina and her owner, Caesar Fernandez, and Chavez lost their homes and all their property in an apartment fire.

He urgently set up a makeshift shelter, but later that day, Rubutina neither moved very well nor barked, nor put out her hand to people first. She explained, "" Especially when it was near my old apartment, I was suffering from trauma. "" Rubutina then faced a citizen who recognized Rubutina for the first time since the recent fire. `` It was the first sign of Rubutina's comeback, '' Siza said. The citizens who heard about the story paid back their condolences to her with good love. She opened a page on the social crowdfunding site, Gopundmi, and started collecting.

As it has been revealed that Jeong used a different standard to deal with the case, the reliability of the investigation results is also being questioned. The February 22, 2008 announcing the ‘stock price manipulation of the president the Grand National Party candidate Lee Myung-bak and other scandals are the result of an’ an independent counsel investigation into allegations on perks, Sangam dmc in the process.Park 57 billion of company executives, including Lee executive director (Handok), cooperation between Korea and Germany Inc., revealed 20 million won to accusations of embezzlement. The suspicion of the Sangam DMC preference states that MB gave preference to Korean residents by distributing parts of the DMC land that can only be sold to foreign companies during the time of Seoul mayor. Having failed to close the case, former independent counsel Jeong informed prosecutors the day before the announcement, "" Further investigation and tracing of the account is needed. ""Prosecutors later indicted them on charges of embezzling billions of won in sales and receiving fees for advertising services from businesses during the sales process of buildings on DMC site in March to May 2007. The Supreme Court admitted the embezzlement charges in 2011, and sentenced Lee to two years and six months in jail, five years of probation, and 1.7 billion won in fines, and three and three years and six months in jail for others.Meanwhile, former special prosecutor Jeong did not announce the embezzlement of 12 billion won (173,000 U.S. dollars) by a daughter of a Darth Vader, who was found to be under suspicion when he announced the results of the probe. Although the embezzled money was more than twice that of a Korean reader, Cho returned the stolen money and is currently working at the dozen without being prosecuted. The People`s Solidarity for Participatory Democracy and others accused Chung of grasping the money he received from the former prosecutor, but failed to hand it over to the prosecution, sparking controversy by setting up a special investigation team. Chung also denied including any of the data in the disclosure of the results of the probe because it is not the case of personal corruption that was discovered during the investigation, Chung said yesterday.However, some outside and outside of the prosecution say that it is hard to accept former independent counsel Jeong's explanation. The prosecutors ` office said they will keep the records of the special prosecutors ` investigation, but they say they can not investigate unless they receive a separate notice from them. A local prosecution official said, It is unusual for an independent counsel to hand over his or her case to the prosecution without having made a substantial amount of investigation, even if it was a discretionary decision.

Local media and foreign media reported on July 12 that the four-meter-tall crocodile has not moved out of the region since it was first seen on the Palu River, the capital of central Ireland, in September 2016. Residents of the town are likely to treat the neck-throated crocodile as a local landmark, including a self-car (short for self-service cameras) set against a backdrop. Local authorities say it is not easy to remove the tire from the crocodile's neck. Last September, he tried to land and catch the crocodile once, but failed to do so because he had shown no interest in the chickens and the pole with the meat on it. Haruna, the local wildlife conservation official, said, We should rescue the animal before we get thirsty with tires, but there isn't much we can do right now because we don`t have the equipment we need. Some say they will use an anesthesiologist gun, but authorities say they could drown if they ran into the water of another crocodile before it was completely under anesthesia. A video clip recently shot raised concerns that the crocodile in question might die of suffocation in the near future as it shows its agony, as if its prayers were weighed down. The largest reptile present, the sea crocodile grows to 7 meters and is classified as a Least Concern in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Antiquities (IUCN's).Indonesian Correspondent to View Crocodiles (Jakarta = Yonhap News) Hwang Chul-hwan : On December 29, 2017, when residents of Falu, central Indonesia, saw a swimming river with a neck in a tire. Indonesian animal rights activists have raised suspicions that a tire was stuck in the neck during a failed attempt to capture a sea crocodile alive. On the other hand, however, some say that the tires dumped on the rivers may have been accidentally choked up, citing that pollution in Indonesia's major rivers is serious. Indonesia's Ministry of Environment and Forest announced in 2015 that the survey results of the transfer of rivers in 33 states showed that 68 percent of them were seriously contaminated and that the main source of pollution was waste from homes. In Indonesia, many people are dumping waste on nearby rivers due to lack of waste disposal facilities and low education levels. Discarded waste is blocked from the river, and is washed out to sea every year during the rainy season (November to March of the following year). According to research by the University of Georgia in the United States announced in early 2016, Indonesia dumped at least 480,000 to 1,290,000 plastic waste into the sea during the year 2010 alone, followed by China (1,320-350,000 tons). hwangch@yna.co.kr is a one-on-one chat with reporters and reporters.

"▽ Measures to reduce minimum wage hikes Only to be dealt with by the government's "" People's Measures to spread inflationary psychology … Setting prices on the streets "" and "" Why should we be the only one who can not keep our own businesses ' voices on the issue of paying rent? ""The security workers are shouting slogans. Kim (62), who runs a Korean food buffet restaurant in Yeouido with his wife, Seoul, raised the price of one serving from 6,000 won to 7,000 won starting this month. Sales are estimated to be around 20 million won per month, but due to the labor costs of three Arvitites (4.2 million won) and materials costs (8 million won), rent increases by the couple by just 4 million won this year. Kim said on July 11, "" It was hard to reduce even the minimum operating staff so I raised the price. "" The government issued another strong warning against self-employed people like Kim. Vice Minister of Strategy and Finance 1 called the first meeting of economy-related ministers at the Government Seoul-Cheong Office and the TFP meeting in order to prepare for the possible spread of inflationary psychology, with the intention of enhancing minimum wage hikes. The Fair Trade Commission will strengthen monitoring of illegal price hikes and analyze the details of price lives of food franchises such as gimbap, chicken, and hamburgers through consumer groups based on minimum wage. On July 5, Goh made the same comment. Kim sighed, "" If I told you not to raise the price when I had to pay the minimum wage because I had to go up the cost, how long would it take for the self-employed to shoulder the burden? "" The government is taking all-out measures to prevent confusion stemming from the wage hikes at the highest ever (16.4 percent). Most of the measures are to restrain, squeeze and mend. Given that the minimum wage increase is not just one year this year, but one year after year, like the pledge to "" achieve 10,000 won in 2020, "" it is clear that these temporary prescriptions must hold up. The price hikes that we hold back are bound to explode one day, and the ' cliff effect ' is inevitable when temporary funding for jobs (job security) and support for the system (four-biggest insurance reductions) are also discontinued. Without proactive social reform to accommodate the minimum wage increase, the government can not afford to normalize the minimum wage without a drastic cut. Moon Jae-in, the president at New Year news conference 10 days “Micro-enterprise and small businessmen and government have had over from measures.” of 3 trillion won of funds and job security.Expressed considerable confidence on the role. However, the reaction on the site is quite different. Lee (30), who runs a private café in Seocho-gu, Seoul, has decided not to ask for job security funds. Lee said, It is not only the complicated method of application, but also I decided it would be better to reduce other costs because of the low cost of providing differential support over working hours. As it is a precondition for subscription to an employment insurance policy, many employers are reluctant to apply for the judgment that it is better to avoid the burden of the four major insurance policies than the subsidy. Kwon Soon-won, business school professor at Sookmyung University in Seoul, said, "" Even if we said it would be difficult to provide more aid in one or two years, the deadline was limited and small - and medium-sized business partners with more than 30 employees had to pay their own costs. "" The government's threat to control the price of shopping streets, which has continued for many days, is also out of touch with reality. Bae Kyu-sik, a senior researcher at the Korea Labor Institute, said, Even if small business owners can externalize their expenses, they can not help but point out that it is a little bit harder to avoid paying down labor costs and rising prices. "" Price hikes are partly due to rising costs, and pressure from the government will put pressure on prices later, "" said Sung Tae-yoon, economics professor at Yonsei University. Most of all, there are growing calls for social acceptance of appropriate price hikes in order for minimum wage hikes to be systematically established. The price increase is one of the many exits that can absorb the minimum wage impact for self-employed people, said Oh Sang-bong, a researcher at the Korea Labor Institute, adding that the public should share the burden of raising the minimum wage bit. Another problem is how to create a win-win situation in which society can share its own financial and fixed costs, such as rent, which is hard for the self-employed and franchise fees. The government is also pushing for a bill to limit the rent increase limit to 5 %, and in the event that costs are increased by revising the standard membership agreement to increase to the minimum wage, the owners will ask for a payment increase in the amount. However, the self-employed are still exposed by the tyranny of "" A "" to which they restrain. We were almost forced to sell hand cream from our headquarters as a gift at the end of last year, said Kim (35), who runs a franchise chicken restaurant in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, as a commission paid more to the headquarters than we paid to raise labor costs. Some say that self-employed businesses that are not competitive in the long run should have social safety nets to allow for the steps to be taken. Professor Kwon Soon-won said, "" Even with the government's support, it is not best to keep companies that can not afford to pay the minimum wage of Arviets as Zombies should, "" adding, "" It is not enough to say that the normalization of soft landing is the lowest possible option.

"Lee Sang-seo, a reporter at Yonhap News Agency in Seoul : Recently, A was involved in an accident while driving near Dal-ha-nae, Seoul, Gyeong-bu Expressway, Sujeong-gu, Gyeonggi-do, Korea I was taken to the hospital, and a private tractor arrived shortly after and moved the wrecked car to a repair shop in Yongdap-dong, Seoul. The following day, the towing charge for the car was 1,027,000 won. The company added up the 30 kilometer-related surcharge of 60,000 won, 250,000 won for special towing, and 100,000 won for lane work. `` At most 25 kilometers, what's the extra charge and what's the special dog's fee? '' he said, adding, `` Is this what you were charged for? ''At 6 p.m. on July 9, a series of crashes occurred on a highway headed to Gwang-ju, Hwasun, South Jeolla Province. Avante drivers then slammed on the snowy roads, followed by a string of 10 cars, including a bus stop in the suburbs. Avante said he was surprised by the light and the light from the tow truck pulled on the side of the road and made a sharp stop. Like Mr. A, drivers are suffering losses from the excessive fare on private tooltrollers. Moreover, some of the drawing-car vehicles are involved in traffic violations, illegal parking cars, and reckless driving with license plates covered to reach the site as soon as possible. Experts stress that stronger punishment and guidance is needed.(Hwasun = Yonhap news agency) On July 9, a cross-country bus carrying 10 passengers crashed into an Avante car at 6:42 p.m. on a highway linking Hwasun County, South Jeolla Province. As a result of the accident, 16 cars following the bus suffered sporadic serial crashes, injuring five people in all. Police are investigating whether Avante was surprised by the light and light from a tow truck when he was standing on the side of the road and applied the brakes immediately. The picture shows a policeman cleaning up the scene. [Yonhap news agency provided by Hwasun Fire Station in South Jeolla Province] ◇ Selections fees and charges were not called? "" but it came before 119 or 112. And the driver was in an accident and dragged the car like crazy. The fare was more than 100,000 won, is the common complaint of those who were affected by the unreasonable price of a private car. They say that they reach the scene of an accident the fastest, bind the car by force, and ask for a rip-off later on. Discourtesy and intimidation were also included.In reality, complaints over car towing has been on the rise every year. Data released last September by the Korea Consumer Agency showed that more and more consumers are talking about tow trucks. Starting from 452 in 2015, the number increased by more than 10 percent to 497 in 2016. As of August, 2017, the number of cases reached 345. Over 1,200 counseling sessions were received during this period.The charge for consultation was overwhelmingly high. The largest proportion was found to have been over charged traction, with 77.4 percent, followed by forced towing at 15.1 percent. The damage to the car was 6.4 percent. As a manager of a major insurance company who has been in charge of repairing traffic accidents for more than a decade, it is no surprise that "" the car drivers are being overcharged for drivers who are crazy at accident sites, "" Choi said. `` Most are ridiculous charges and they don't need to be paid, '' Choi argued. `` In the end, these accidents are the causes of the increase. ''◇ Train drivers arriving five minutes after the accident = Driving recklessly to reach the site of an accident is another problem. In April 2016, three trucks crossed the center line or headed backward on the central highway of Yeongju, North Gyeongsang Province. He even backed the tractor about a kilometer from the highway. Police said they used violent driving to get to the scene first. Last year, a live video showing a tow truck driver running in reverse traffic was shown on social networking sites, sparking controversy. Police in southern Gyeonggi Province arrested 140 cases of irregularities in one month after a special crackdown on towing vehicles began November 10 last year. Thirty-three violations of the main car, 21 violations of signals, and three illegal U-Turns. There were even cases of blackmailing the drivers. "" Speeding is basic and I almost always felt scared when I saw a tractor I was driving without blinking, "" said driver Lee (35). Another problem is the arbitrary relocation or damage of license plates to avoid restriction. Lee Won-wook, a fisherman who belongs to the National Assembly`s Committee for Land, Infrastructure and Transport, said in a report released last October, We see an increase in the number of car license plates being damaged or intentionally covered by a tractor. According to Lee, the number of crimes against license plate holders increased from about 1,000 in 2013 to 1,210 the following year. It also exceeded 2,000 cases for the first time in 2016. Last year, the relocation was already on par with August. Such misconduct leads to detection is just the tip of the iceberg, said Rep. Lee, who really had a lot of violations.The government also drew its sword to avoid being hit by a tractor that was deliberately covered with license plates (Lee Won-wook's office). The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced last November that it would increase the price of a tractor from a strikeout to a toe-out. If caught, the operator and the driver are suspended from the car for 30 days, and the second car will be subject to reduction and cancellation of license, respectively. It is certainly illegal to charge more than the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport's report on the special car fare and charge for recovery. If the vehicle is towed or towed without permission against the will of the driver, the tractor operator will be tightened to 20 days of suspension, 40 days of suspension of all secondary projects, and 60 days of suspension of all third operations.According to the Korea Highway Corporation, small vehicles can be towed for free to the safe area when reported by the call center (1588-2504). In addition, when a special traction service is called to sign up for car insurance, one can use it for free up to 10 kilometers. Kim Ki-bok, head of the Civil Transportation Safety Association, diagnosed the imbalance between supply and demand as the root cause of the problem. As the registration system was changed 15 years ago, anyone could drive, Kim said, adding, "" The supply has grown rapidly since then, and the competition has become so fierce lately. "" This means that the market is saturated to the extent that it can afford to do anything. As most of them belong to private businesses, not companies, it is hard to regulate them, Kim explained. `` I even have a tow truck driver standing on the block and sleeping there, '' he said. `` Having lived like that and been behind the wheel, I wonder if I could drive properly. '' There is also a need for genealogy Professor Kim Jin-hyung at the Korea Highway Traffic Corp. said, In an interview with several drivers in the past, many people did not have a driving culture and education or guidance system for those drivers. When asked whether he has been reversed, one of the drivers answered, "" Yes, "" Kim said proudly, analyzing the system, which enables anyone to drive a tractor with a license. Private drivers say they know the public opinion but can not help it. It is our goal to arrive as soon as possible, said Kim, a three-year history driver who said, Speeding up speed is essential to see the competition get fierce. I understand the complaints of drivers, but as a type of job and livelihood, I ask that we understand, Kim said, adding, Our traffic accidents are quickly corrected. Oh Hyung-taek, 35, an ambulance driver at a major insurance company, said, I have to speed up because of the customers ` urging and rules of losing money if I am late. This is because when the call is received for more than 15 minutes, the fee is cut or the rating falls. Oh complained, "" The thirty-minute security guarantee is considered unfair business instructions, and anyone who arrives by a tow truck in 15 minutes is not an issue.

According to a survey conducted by the Korean Institute for Criminology and Justice, the largest number of women in the world who expressed themselves to major communities in terms of the ' Daily Best ' and ' Daily Unfavored ' cases were 1,918.Experts say that the frustration and insecurity that has become daily, such as the prolonged economic slump and the ever worst job shortage, are causing people to pour out their anger toward the weak.

If the designation of a senior general hospital is finally canceled, the doctor will be officially demoted to the general hospital. A ministry official said on July 12, No clinic appointment will be made when medical teams are transferred to the prosecution for the serial deaths of four newborns in the intensive care unit of a hospital in Mok-dong, Ewha Womans University. Police said Monday that the deaths of four infants were caused by septicemia caused by infections in the seat of the virus, and that the injection may have been contaminated or caused by the treatment of injection drugs. According to the results of such investigations, the police booked two nurses who violated the obligation to manage infections in handling geotrophics, and five senior nurses or physicians who violated the duty of guiding and supervising them, and a total of five doctors The ministry announced its evaluation results on the appointment of the third term from 2018 to 2020 last month, and postponed designating Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital.

However, it is considered that the lipotrophic injection, which was injected to supply fatty acids and calories to infants, could have been contaminated with sheets or in the course of handling. The exact route of infection is therefore expected to be revealed through police investigations into medical teams. However, it is expected that the hospital and medical team will have difficulty avoiding responsibility as the cause of death was confirmed as bacterial infections in hospitals, apart from the remaining police investigation results.Police Presentationer Shin Joon-hee (Yonhap news agency) at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) : Officials of the metropolitan police department are searching for the deaths of newborns in the intensive care unit of Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital Monday.

Infectious doctors say the sap is infected with an antibiotic resistance bacillus, Cetrobacter Frundi, which, at the same time, could lead to fatal accidents. Police are focusing on the possibility that the lipid nutrients contained in the vial or damaged the process of opening the vial and connecting it to the injection. It indicates two possible contamination of the sap during factory production, or while working to inject it into a newborn baby in a hospital. In the case of an infant injection, the capacity is adjusted according to body weight and mixed with glucose, protein, and vitamin C. The KCDC also conducted an investigation and analysis on the implications of the preparations for administration in the neonatal intensive care unit (possibly contaminated) rather than the supposedly environment at the pharmacy last month.Choi Pyeong-cheon, a reporter at the Korea Open News Agency, said, "" I heard that four newborns died one after another in an accident at Ewha Womans University's Mok-dong Hospital on July 18 and that of a newly hatched baby died in an accident.

Therefore, infectious doctors believe that if contaminated sap was injected into a newborn, it could spread immediately and affect the heartbeat in multiple ways. Although it is unusual for the international waters to have died at the same time due to bacterial infections, the results were revealed to the four people at the same time were similar to the rapid changes in heart rate and the symptoms of abdominal dilation. To check the possible contamination of the sap, we also need to look further into where it was served, who and how it was distributed, and whether it was kept refrigerated. bio@yna.co.kr"
"VMT results revealed ... "" Less depressed "" Description…Interpretation by Jidinet Korea = Immin-cheol Interpretable security patches are applied at the official processing unit (CPU) where the Spector-Compliant security bugs are housed. However, the results of the specific tests indicate that not all users will experience a significant level of degradation.Intel was under fire last week for not offering any initial evidence of vulnerabilities, and for its stance in the general user environment that there would be no noticeable performance penalty after security patches. Because the users of intellet-chip based PCs have been frustrated with the concerns of losing performance when patching and the threat of security when refusing to patch.Recent announcements indicate that Intel executives vary depending on the results of the tests ; however, they are belatedly admitting that a 6-7 % performance penalty occurred after the CPU security patch (although this is a small concern) ; and It is questionable whether the majority of PC users around the world agree with this statement.Intel released its benchmark results on January 10, 2018, confirming the performance degradation of its Windows PC with spector-melt-down security vulnerability patches via its official site. Although it admitted that there was a decline in performance, it argued that the drop was small.[Photo = Pixabay] ■ Intel, still "" no big impact on performance "" …? Navine Shenoy, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Data Center for Data Processing and Public Affairs at Intel PC-generation PC Processor Installation and Data Center, announced on the Intel site on July 10. Although the figures acknowledged a decline in performance, the traditional view of mainstream users was that losses were not significant. Intel has configured its six computer systems, including the jongh-generation, CPU-generation, high performance, and four different CPU based simulation scenarios, among core processors recently released since the third quarter of 2015.Intel has represented the benchmark results as & apos ; % ; measuring the pre-patch performance of the six systems. If the performance of a patch is the same as before and after 100 %, the performance of the patch is not as good as that of a patch. However, errors in the range of ± 3 per cent shall be considered.Core i7 8700 K processor - based computers for 8th generation coffee lake desktop computers were Windows 10 and SSD-enabled computers, introduced in Q4 2017. The system lost from a low 0 % to an 8 % performance point per tool. The criteria for the criteria for the detailed items were items with maximum loss increased to 12 %.The 8-generation core I 8660 U processor base system, introduced in the third quarter of 2017, was also a Windows 10 and SSD enabled computer. The system lost 1 % to 10 % of its performance on a tool-specific basis. As for the criteria for detailed items, the maximum losses were extended to reach 14 percent.Shenoy, however, commented on the results by saying, "" We added less to the performance of eighth-generation platforms that use SSDs, "" and added, "" The impact of the various workloads combined was greater than the impact of the maximum of 6 % on the maximum complexity of the JavaScript. ""Percentage of performance changes in Windows PCs following a spector-melting security vulnerability patch released by Intel. This data is available through the link to the body PDF file in an article below. At the bottom of the document, specific PC specific details are also included.Core i7 7920 HQ processor-based computers for 7th generation (Kabilake) Mobiles were Windows 10 and SSD-enabled computers, introduced in the first quarter of 2017. The system lost 1 % to 7 % of its performance on a tool-specific basis. Other scores also showed that the maximum loss rate was increased to 14 percent."" We measured the 7th generation Kabirak-H's mobile platform performance (with a decline in patch-up), "" Shenoi said, "" and the impact was approximately 7 % on the SIS-Mark 2014 SE benchmark. ""■ Core I700 processor based system for sixth-generation (Skylate) desktops released in Q3 2015 has lost up to 10 % of performance on a tool-by-tool basis. As for the detail item scores per tool, the loss was 21 % or even up to 6 % higher after patch.However, the results of the testing of the sixth-generation core i7 systems differed, depending on which OS and storage device was used. The tests were divided into three components, Windows 10 and SSD, Windows 7 and SSD, and Windows 7 and HDD, depending on OS and storage configuration.Computers with 6 generation core computers were Windows 10 and SSD-enabled at their highest performance loss, with 101 % having exceeded 100 % at their lowest. Computers using Windows 7 and SSDs were 94 percent in high performance loss and 100 percent in low performance. Computers using Windows 7 and HDD were 92 percent more likely to lose performance, and 100 percent less frequently.Shenoy has based on the results, saying, "" We measured the sixth-generation Skylak-S platform and found that the performance impact on the sixth-generation platform is slightly higher, but usually not as significant as the performance impact on our eighther-generation and seventh-generation platforms ""Intel used the PC Benchmark Program, Cismark 2014SE, PC Mark 10, 3D Mark SkyTiver and Web browser performance measurement web XPRT 2015 to measure the performance of the above six systems. Measurement value of the benchmark program applied to the calculating percentage is a clue that indicates an error in the 3 % range. [Text View] ■ Based on overall computer response speed after patch and measurements by event of slow web app usage, SyMark 2014 SE analyzed the performance of its office productivity software, financial data, and office applications. PC mark 10 measured the performance of Windows applications related to minimum functionality and content creation and productivity. The 3D mark skydiver measured the direct X11 version of the game's drive. The web XPRT 2015 measured six web application drive performance : browser's HTML5 - based photo correction, album arrangement, stock information, note encryption store, sales data graphs, and DNA sequencing.Responsiveness refers to the extent to which users experience the commands, instructions, and expected tasks being performed while handling a computer system. Even computers with fast actual operations may experience slower performance if they are not responsive. [Photo = Pixabay] A notable feature for actual PC users is the responsiveness of the items in the SyMark2014SE and the measurement of the results of the XPRT 2015 tool.First of the reactivity items of SystemMark 2014SE, five of the six systems experienced a double-digit performance decline after patching. One system that did not suffer any degradation was Windows 7 computers, the only one that used HDDs. A less responsive computer is likely to feel sluggish even though it performs all other operations. This means that the advantages of general SSDs can be offset after the CPU patch.Measurement results for the web XPRT 2015 tool may also affect a wide range of users. The tool's measurements are based on Edge browser in Windows 10 and Internet Explorer (IE) in Windows 7. If MS's best-optimized browser performance in Windows 10 falls to as low as 7 % and possibly as high as 10 %, the performance range of other browsers that are more popular with actual users could be even higher.Adrian Kingsley Hughes of the U.S. Gedinet Corporation reported on July 11 (local time) also said, "" I felt that the maximum impact of Spector and Meltdown Patches was due to web browsing and overall system responsiveness by most users. "" Although performance may have to be poor, regular PC users still recommend the CPU security patch.Lim Min-cheol, reporter at (imc@zdnet.co.kr) and subscribe to Jidinet Korea from Naver."

According to the industry on July 12, IT service companies have been paying keen attention to the government's direction to regulate virtual currency. Companies that have been operating in related businesses for various block chains are concerned that it might happen, but they don't see any immediate impact on their businesses. SK Corp., which is in the process of doing its block chain logistics business, said, "" Virtual money is just one of many services using block chains. "" "" The project we're running now has no significant impact. "" LG CNS officials who are preparing financial services using the block chain platforms said, Rather, It is not that big an impact has been made. However, the derivatives market using block chains is forecast to hit. An official of an IT service company said, We expected the expansion of virtual currency transactions would open up the related service market, including the construction of related systems, but we were concerned that it would be difficult for the time being because of government regulations. There are many small and midsize companies that develop products using block chains, and the government`s intervention will have an impact on product development, said Shin Min-soo, a professor of business administration at Hanyang University, who clearly stated the scope of regulation. A block chain, called a digital public book, shares data in a sort of block format with the people involved in the transaction. As construction costs are low and security is high, it is possible to combine them with various industries, including finance and logistics. According to Gartner Inc., the global block chain market is forecast to reach $ 10 billion in 2022. Citing the growth of block chains, Korea`s largest IT service providers have expanded their operations since last year. The government also said it will proactively support block chains as the core technology of the fourth industrial revolution. The government has begun to regulate virtual currency, but the IT industry expects that the policy stance will not change much. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Strategy and Finance Kim Dong-yeon also stated on the same day, "" The technology of the block chain was one of the technologies based on the 4th Industrial Revolution.

"Shinhan Bank's other commercial banks also joined in the withdrawal ... Park Yong-ju, reporter of Yonhap News Agency (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency), has decided to withdraw the real-name policy for transaction of virtual currency (cipher currency). We will consider whether to introduce the product carefully considering the overall situation in the future, but considering the current stance of the government, it will be difficult to introduce it in the future. This means the virtual account is effectively canceled, so the virtual currency transaction is inevitably contracted.According to financial authorities and the industry on July 12, Shinhan Bank decided not to introduce a real-name bank transaction service that the government announced at the end of last month through special measures. A system has already been developed to introduce a real name verification service, but it is not advisable to introduce a system to enable virtual currency transactions when such a deal has become a social issue, a Shinhan official said. The government decided to stop issuing new virtual accounts to virtual currency dealers and introduce a real-name bank transaction service by taking special measures on July 28. Real name bank services have the advantage of being able to ensure the identity of the transaction with a virtual account service that allows the transaction's real name account and the same bank account of a virtual currency handler. However, Shinhan Bank decided not to provide even virtual accounts based on the real name verification. Whether or not the bank can confirm the real name of the bank means it will not be given a virtual account for virtual currency transactions. Shinhan Bank sent an official letter to the three exchanges (Bitsum, Cobbit, and Iya Labs) on July 10, advising them to prepare a plan for the existing virtual accounts. In particular, it announced that it would prohibit deposit into existing virtual accounts on the 15th. Deports from existing virtual accounts into personal accounts are allowed. If the bank allows withdrawal, but stops deposit, the existing virtual account transaction will disappear. We are simply canceling a virtual account contract with the Korea Virtual Monetary Exchange, said an official at Shinhan Bank. Other commercial banks are likely to join the decision. We will not operate the real-name bank system, too, said an official at the Industrial Bank of Korea. We decided to gradually close our existing accounts, too. KEB Hana Bank is also in a very confusing situation, so it will make a careful decision on whether to introduce the bank by the deadline. A commercial bank official said, "" If the authorities give a clear signal that they would allow the real-name bank service, but under the circumstances, it was not acceptable to provide a virtual currency transaction account. "" As a result, the virtual currency exchange that transacts these banks would have to redirect to the so-called ' honeycomb account ', which holds many individual transactions under the corporate account, or apply a real-name bank service. A honeycomb account, in which many individual transactions are held under the corporate account, can not accommodate customers larger than a certain size due to difficulties in keeping accounts. The assessment that it can not be an alternative to virtual accounts is dominant. If the financial institutions of Choi Jong-koo, chairman of the Financial Services Commission, all try to suspend virtual accounts, the virtual currency transaction could go beyond a mere deflation and become negative offline. A commercial bank official said, "" Aborting the use of a real-name bank account and eliminating existing accounts would in reality be refusing to pay payments to the exchange, "" adding, "" We can declare a virtual currency exchange more effective than an effective payment settlement.

""Among them, the Ministry of Science and Technology, which regards itself as the responsible agency in charge of response to the fourth industrial revolution, said, "" Virtual currency and block chains are different. "" The Justice Ministry's move to scrap the exchange is not specifically concerned about the industry.A ministry official said yesterday that the ministry and the ministry should resolve the basic stance of lowering the overcharging on virtual currency through cooperation between related ministries and the related businesses, only repeating, virtual currency and block chains are different.However, he could not comment specifically on how he regards the abolition of the virtual currency exchange.`` It is not desirable for virtual bills to go into speculation. '' We need some level of regulation.The stance of the Ministry of Information and Communication is that Minister Yoo Young-min could not take one step out of his speech at the year-end press conference late last year.Minister Yoo said, We should try separating virtual bills from block chains. Block Chain is an area the Ministry of Information and Communication should focus on next year. The product or money is clearly not prepared by the government and we are working on it as a pancreatist.◇ ICT industry says, "" Let's just grow intranets instead of the Internet, "" but with such news, the ICT industry is criticizing that it blocked the mission of becoming the leading agency of the fourth industrial revolution. "" The industry experts say that the first business model in the block chain ecosystem is cipher money, and that the government should ban transactions and block the disclosure of virtual currency (ICO), and what block chains should be used to grow?

"Lee Joon-seok, a 35-year-old journalist at the eastern police station in Yong-in, Gyeonggi Province, is being transferred to New Zealand Monday afternoon after killing a biological family. Kim will be returned to Korea after 80 days and face police investigation. Police on ljs@newsis.com have cleared the family of murder by a suspect, identified as Kim, who was convicted of committing a robbery for monetary purposes and who "" pleaded not to be a conspiracy "" with his wife. Dongbu Police Station in Yong-in, Gyeonggi Province, announced on July 12 that it would request an arrest warrant for a 35-year-old suspect, identified as Kim, for murder and murder of a robber. Kim murdered his biological mother and his brother (then 14 years old) in an apartment in Cheoin-gu, for money, between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. on October 21 last year. He killed two children at the same time at the same time. Right after the crime, he took a hundred and eighteen million won from his mother's account and took his wife and daughters to Incheon International Airport on July 23. It was revealed that the Kims, who shopped with a bag of honorary products and bags for their parents ' parents ' parents ' parents ' money was exchanged for 100,000 New Zealand dollars (or 77 million won). Kim, who fled to New Zealand, was caught in a trap as he was arrested for stealing from the country. Kim, who was forcibly returned to Korea 80 days ago, said in a preliminary investigation until midnight that he committed the crime accidentally and did not conspire with his wife. However, the police, based on the results of their investigations so far, said that the testimony of Kim was unreliable, and plans to investigate the case further.Lee Jeong-seon, a reporter at the eastern police station in Seoul, said Monday that the arrest warrant for a man identified as identified as Kim (35), a murder suspect, was actually opened to the police in Suwon. ppljs@newsis.com is also planning to apply for an arrest warrant for those who decided to commit the crime for money and murdered their mothers, not for murder by their own mothers. The death penalty is a death penalty, a life sentence, or an organic sentence of more than seven years, while robbery and murder are punishable by death or imprisonment. His wife, who was arrested before Kim and is on trial, was charged with murder for her life. Jeong, who returned to Korea on November 1 last year with his daughters before Kim, is on trial for conspiracy, including plotting her crimes and preparing to flee the country. Police believe the arrest warrant for Kim will be issued without any difficulty. Once a warrant is issued, the court will question the exact cause of the crime and whether they have colluded with his wife. Although Kim admits the charges, he denies any involvement in any scheme or conspiracy with his wife, a police officer said, We will assess the charges based on previous investigations. kjh1@newsis.comFrom the office, > meeting … ""I don't hide trace of bitterness in the investigation, mb 檢"" government obsessiveness "" Moon Jae-in at obvious political revenge … A new year began to mbIn ""(= Seoul, Yonhap news : Lee Myung-bak (press) ianseung mb Special Programs) said that the money of the National Intelligence Service is the former president (expenses) Poem by Cheong Wa Dae for controversy as a bribe.""

Ports in the port of Jungwang 1-ri, Jigok-myeon, Seosan-si, Chungcheongnam-do have frozen about 10cm of ice on the dock, preventing small ships from leaving, thus causing disruptions to the operation of the mine. "" Hampyeong Haeng-hol lost 15,000 chicken wings. "" They put all their energy into disinfection and disinfection by blocking AI, but they lost their chickens due to the snow and cold snap. Snow poured three days before the incident as if it had been breached, and on July 10, the Hwaseo building, a nest of 15,800 chickens, collapsed. Kim's eyes are piled high with warm weather. The wooden slatting house collapsed under the weight of snow on its roof. In the congratulatory address, where chickens are gathered, cooler weather poured in, with fallen walls and a split roof was less than 10 degrees below zero at night. Most of the young chickens, which were hatched more than a month ago, froze to death due to the cold. The chickens were trying to survive the long winter night by dividing their body temperature. Having survived two nights in the past, the chickens gathered on piles of corpses to avoid the cold, congratulatory floors.Icicles formed inside the fallen congratulatory address. Icicles formed on top of the heads of surviving chickens struggling on tiny wings. Kim sighed while looking at congratulatory speeches that had turned into Abidou-conversion. Kim, who returned to Korea on December 24, 2016, met with misfortune seven times after selling chickens hatched from the eggs. I took care of the chickens in the morning and evening, learning the unfamiliar things, but I ended up in vain. Since November last year, when the cold weather started to cool down, he did not go home while sleeping at a farm shelter to protect chickens from AI threats. Kim, who did not insure damages on buildings, believes he needs 150 million won to destroy the damaged congratulatory address and build a new one. He runs a computer store, and he has no money to spare.A chicken body tangled under the crashed congratulator. Kim said, I could have gotten AI in case I had to catch it and put lime powder in the mouth of the farm and put disinfectant regularly, but I don`t know what to expect. It is unrealistic. I hope the government or local governments can help me make a new congratulatory call with low interest rates, he said, sighing from having to live on.

"[Graphic] Incheon Airport Passenger Terminal 2 ' Opening Date : Starting March 18, 2006, when a connecting line is opened between Incheon Airport and Seoul and Kyung-gi, when the terminal is being shipped from Incheon International Airport (Yeongjong-dong = Yonhap) Kang Jong-koo, reporter of Incheon International Airport, Incheon International Airport, is scheduled to open on July 18, but Incheon citizens are not expected to have a single bus route connecting Incheon and its land. Incheon City said Monday that there are 17 bus routes connected to terminal T1, but there are no T2 bus routes. Only one route connecting T2 to downtown will be established when bus number 307 is scheduled to end with T2 at Youngjong-sammok docks in March. Incheon City is planning to change the end of bus number 203 from T1 to T2. However, since most buses operating in Incheon are not allowed to have a bus line that connects T2 at Yeongjong Station, both routes are open, it is intended to open on Youngjongjong-do Island. Even so, the two routes will not connect with the T2 until after T2 is opened. For this reason, Incheon citizens who use Korean Air, Delta Airlines, Air France Airlines, KLM Netherlands Airlines, and others must take a bus and take a shuttle bus or a shuttle train to Busan Airport by bus. By contrast, the Seoul-Gyeonggi bus route was connected with T2. Eight of the 35 buses from Seoul to the airport stop at T2 first and move to T1. The remaining 27 routes reach T2 after arriving first at T1. More than 20 routes of Kyung-gi bus are also operated from T1 to T2. Incheon Airport residents who are close to the airport were more uncomfortable when they went to the airport than residents living in other cities and provinces were constantly criticized before the T2 opening. You can not take a trunk larger than a certain size on the bus from Incheon to the airport. Unlike coach buses or coach buses with no baggage, city buses with no baggage are mostly passengers with suitcases by citing the regulation ' If you disturb the safe driving. ' However, since the specifications of the bag that is not allowed to be carried are not clearly defined, scuffles between bus drivers and passengers are also frequent. Four e-bus carrying suitcases were opened last May, but the buses only run during rush hour, leaving the route under-available for general travelers. Finally, when Incheon citizens take the Incheon subway and transfer from Gyeyang station to the airport to go to the airport, it takes one or two hours to get to the airport from the rest of the world. Incheon city officials said the Incheon airport has other transportation systems such as the airport railway, forcing the buses to run fewer routes than Seoul and Kyung-gi, and they will push for the expansion of the bus lines connecting Yeonsu-gu to the airport during the first half of this year. inyon@yna.co.kr 2018.01.11. park7691@newsis.com' In legal circles and business circles on July 12, the government's announcement of a special announcement and suppression of virtual currency speculation were rapidly spreading around the stock market. The Jirasi said, "" The Ministry of Justice selects one of the exchanges as a private gambling business, closes it down, and applies it to other businesses in a row. "" In addition, the inflow of virtual currency into North Korea's nuclear development funds (exchange) and the laundering of illegal funds and profit trading (exchange) are soaring. It also includes sequential measures to apply the real-name financial transaction system and nurturing technology in block chains, independent of the eradication of gambling in the nation. The ministry stressed in this regard, It is not true at all. The rumor is just groundless. However, the ministry reaffirmed its plan to push for a special law aimed at shutting down the bourse. The ministry has prepared a special law to close the virtual currency exchange the day before, and it will push ahead with consultations later with relevant ministries, the ministry explained. Earlier in the day, Justice Minister Bahk Sang-key told reporters at a news conference, We are preparing legislation to ban transactions on the virtual currency exchange and even aimed at shutting it down. Asked by a journalist whether a bill to close the exchange is being created at the pan-government level, he said, There is no difference between the ministries on how to draw up a closure bill. After the announcement, the presidential office issued a statement saying, It is not the final package of measures to deal with the cancellation of the crypto-money exchange, but the Justice Ministry is preparing to finalize the statement. naun@newsis.comAirport users prepare to issue tickets at Jeju International Airport Wednesday morning.

"A painting drawn by Kang Hye-young, who left her husband for an over-working suicide last year, and the person with the cane is weighed down by a huge mountain and pouring dirt. Hye-young explained to me, My husband is going to ask me. As I am holding on, I am depending on my stick. Meeting of victims in Korea, Rosa and the Under Bird-Company. Lee Chae-hyeon (alias) left home in a work suit. She texted her husband, holding the sharper light from her cell phone in the dark. There was no reply ' You have already left for work ~. ' Around 3:20 a.m. The next day, Hye-young's brother Kang Hye-jin (alias · 31) heard about her husband's death. It was the phone call of an insane sister. The brother-in-law went up into his parents ' apartment and threw himself in the air. Wearing gray work clothes and wearing brown shoes. Hyejin thought it was a dream. I called my brother but he didn't answer. The estimated time of death for police was 0:50 on June 17, 2017, when he was 39 and had a 77 day baby.‘ I was afraid my sister would die too … ’ my brother-in-law was a good man. I laughed off my displeasure. If Hye-jin, a nurse, complains about hard work, she hears it silently and says, It is hard. Your job is the hardest part, "" she said. His brother-in-law went to a big company in Gyeongnam. He was a researcher, but recently he was engaged in administrative duties unrelated to his major. One day, he complained about a side dish that he had never eaten before. I forgot to feed the baby milk powder, so I gave it to her twice, and I just changed the diaper and found it again. He began to dissemble with his wife that he didn't want to go to work. "" I think he's ignoring me. "" "" What's wrong with me? "" "" It's too hard, "" said Hye-jin, the last time she saw me. "" Chae-hyun, who looked tired when she visited her sister last May, complained, It is hard. After Hye-jin returned to Seoul, one month after her husband died. Hyejin said, If I had noticed then ... Hyejin stayed with her older sister. I had to leave the light on for three months before I could fall asleep. I was afraid of the sound of the voice calling out in the dark as if I were crying to tell you the news of my death. I slept less than 3 hours a day for the first month. The biggest reason was my older sister. I don`t know when she would die, so I slept only when I felt certain that she was sleeping staring at her sister who was lying down.The company refused and the law remained idle, a co-worker of Chae-hyun told the bereaved family that the company killed him. Hye-jin tried to identify his brother-in-law's "" over-worked suicide "" on behalf of his sister who was unable to escape from the shock. I haven't had a good rest in the last class. After leaving the office, I went down to Kyung-Nam. She went back and forth from home to abroad for nine hours to look up information on industrial accidents and get information from friends and acquaintances. Compared to their efforts, they did not perform very well. The company refused and the law remained idle. The company was not supposed to be an industrial disaster since it didn't die in-house. Hye-jin asked the company for Chae-hyeon's commuting record, her retirement income statement, and an in-company group accident insurance policy, but could not receive it. In South Korea, the company has no responsibility to prove that workers did not die from overwork. The proof is the responsibility of the bereaved. However, there is no legal ground for the bereaved to access the commuting record, the work CCTV and the computer access record. We felt that there was no law for workers, Hyejin said. The occupational safety and safety legislation and the work standard Act are not clear. The Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance Act has strict standard of accident recognition, so it is difficult to get an overrecognization. Korea has no official statistics on over-the-work suicides. The industrial accident was not addressed as a matter of the right of workers to work safely and healthily. The bereaved family tried to get testimony and evidence from Chae Hyun's colleagues, but it was not easy. Hye-jin said, I heard the company put pressure on her, citing defamation. Whenever I heard that, I felt sorry and sorry for those who wanted to help us.Members of the Federation of Korean Trade Unions held a resolution meeting in front of the KDB Industrial Bank in Yeouido in September last year to demand improvements in the law and system to prevent over-load. Newsis Chaehyeon's remains were not found in person. Hyejin said the company blocked anyone from entering the building because it was confidential. Shortly afterward, the articles were handed over, and contained in a box wrapped in bronze tape. After accepting the request, Hye-young told her younger brother, My husband was treated this way.Even though she is so tired, Hye-jin has been collecting data. She scrutinized his cellular phone and CCTV around his street. She went to work. He participated in the "" Korea, Rosa and Godoon Suicides of suicides "" which was created in July last year, sharing information and repairing the trauma with his sister. Seeing the data that were still a ray of hope, Hyejin thought, I saw my brother-in-law lived a hard life. Hye-jin was told by her husband's co-worker that he was constantly surrounded by excessive work pressure and insults from her boss. Chae-hyeon, a graduate of a prestigious university, was put to shame by saying, "" I'm out of college at ○○. "" Japan, which started to discuss the problem of over-load before Korea, says, "" I don't see the physical burden of working long hours, but I think the mental burden of over-working, and the harassment of the office causes me to kill myself. "" The day before she died, Chae-hyeon texted her boss, ' I'm afraid I can't come to work because I'm depressed. ' The day before that, I said, ' I'm sorry. I don't think I can come to work today at all. I think it's my limit, ' she said. The day before that, he went to the hospital to get a nutritional supplement and went back to work. His doctor's verdict was "" I felt tired. "" The dead cellular phone is still open to traffic. Hye-jin said, "" Whenever I see the phone, I get irritated. "" If it is too hard, put it out of sight. They still carry ' uncomfortable ' cell phones. I don't think there are any new data available to support my ill-suspended death. Hyejin sometimes looks at the pictures on her cell phone. There is still a figure of the wife and sister who laughed and did not know that her parents laughed. Whenever they do, let's not be hasty. Let's walk slowly ' My goal is to live happily with my sister and niece. Hye-jin said, I want to show my husband how good we are when we are left behind. To do so, we need to be recognized as being scattered.I sent my husband to draw a picture. If she survives, I would rather kill her, "" said Hye-young, after her husband was sent away, she said, "" a man left behind with all of her personal sorrow. "" The blame for having failed to prevent her husband's death and the judgment of others is not good enough. She received painting treatment at a group of family members who killed themselves in Korea, Rosa and Godong. Trauma is also revealed in his paintings. Something that looks like a huge mountain occupies most of the paper. From the left side of the mountain, lines pour down in disorder like landslides. There is a stick bending down. The mountain is oppressed by the pouring soil. Hye-young explained to me, My husband is going to ask me. As I am holding on, I am depending on my stick and try hard. Lee Ju-yung, a painting therapist, said, If you commit suicide from overwork or from overwork, you will be shocked and saddened because it is a sudden death for the bereaved. If we don`t manage the resentment and despair properly, we can die another death. In her other paintings, 10,000 won and 50,000 won bills fly in the air. `` It is debt that makes me feel worse than sorrow after my husband's death. The reward is long, but the cost of living is expensive. Sometimes resentment leads before you even feel sad. `` It is typical of the bereaved family to feel sad and can not afford to mourn over the issue immediately, '' Chung said.Kwon Joong-hyeok, Correspondent of Kakao Friends green@kmib.co.kr[ [Facebook]"
"Rescue Waiting, Died ... We've been talking to victims for 13 minutes. Please come quickly. We are dying, Yonhap news agency said. Kim's cell phone, which was revealed by the bereaved family's committee on December 11, was recorded as a call by a woman and police officer who were presumed to have been victim for 13 minutes from 4:07 p.m. to 4:20 p.m. on December 21 last year. Kim called his wife on the sixth floor at 4:03 p.m., 10 minutes after the fire was reported. The reason for the attack was not immediately clear, but the woman was connected, and Kim replaced the phone with a police officer who was in control of the scene. She said on her first call, I hear too much smoke. I am alone. The woman and the police officer had several conversations to confirm their location, but the conversation was not carried out properly because police officers were in control of the scene.[Yonhap] Woman says, "" I'm going to die for about a minute and a half. Hello. Hello. It is fast. Three and a half minutes later, "" That's what the fire department is using to describe it as rescue. Please wait a minute, "" the policeman called again, and the victim said, "" It's like a warehouse. "" Since then, no further communication has been made between the victim and the police. It is believed that police officers were cleaning up the scene without turning off the phone. But since then, the victim has been "" dead to death "" on a non-responding phone. quickly quickly Hello? "" The woman could not speak until she gave a nearly screwed-out cry at five minutes and 20 seconds of talking.The phone that the police officer left on the floor contained the exact voice of the bereaved family, who were waiting for the rescue of their family. An presumed son of Kim cried out, Where is the mother? "" I can see the window, but I can't break the window and my mom is dead, "" Kim said. "" What if I don't break the window, "" he cried. "" Please break the window when I talk to my mom on the phone. We can not yell for the windows to be broken, cried the fire department, blaming it for not being able to rescue them properly. In the midst of the fire, the woman's groan decreased. And it was hard to breathe, but after 13 minutes, the call was cut off at 4:20 p.m. The call shows that the fire authorities failed to act aggressively to increase the damage, said an official of the bereaved family's countermeasure committee, which should be thoroughly investigated. bwy@yna.co.kr and inquiry, 1:1 chatting with reporters, and a reward of 67 billion won for compensation at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics ' trial court.The investigation team of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office (team leader Park Chan-ho) received an order to protect Won from the court Friday in preparation for his possible guilt at a trial on state coffers losses.In the future, Won is not allowed to dispose of her real estate sales and gifts as well as of her current assets as her own during the trial.We are currently in the process of securing the amount from Won's assets to cover the losses incurred by the national treasury of 6.5 billion won, prosecution officials said.Won was put to trial on July 7 on charges of paying for activities related to the NIS psychological warfare team's illegal online and offline activities from early 2010 until the end of 2012.Prosecutors said earlier that the national treasury used by Won for purposes amounted to 6.5 billion won over several hundred times.Prosecutors will further prosecute cases of illegal political maneuvering, including the creation of a blacklist of celebrities and control of public broadcasters.▶ Chatting on 1:1 with reporters. This visual lead news kdragon@cbs.co.kr We will consider whether to introduce the product carefully considering the overall situation in the future, but considering the current stance of the government, it will be difficult to introduce it in the future. This means the virtual account is effectively canceled, so the virtual currency transaction is inevitably contracted.According to financial authorities and the industry on July 12, Shinhan Bank decided not to introduce a real-name bank transaction service that the government announced at the end of last month through special measures. A system has already been developed to introduce a real name verification service, but it is not advisable to introduce a system to enable virtual currency transactions when such a deal has become a social issue, a Shinhan official said. The government decided to stop issuing new virtual accounts to virtual currency dealers and introduce a real-name bank transaction service by taking special measures on July 28. Real name bank services have the advantage of being able to ensure the identity of the transaction with a virtual account service that allows the transaction's real name account and the same bank account of a virtual currency handler. However, Shinhan Bank decided not to provide even virtual accounts based on the real name verification. Whether or not the bank can confirm the real name of the bank means it will not be given a virtual account for virtual currency transactions. Shinhan Bank sent an official letter to the three exchanges (Bitsum, Cobbit, and Iya Labs) on July 10, advising them to prepare a plan for the existing virtual accounts. In particular, it announced that it would prohibit deposit into existing virtual accounts on the 15th. Deports from existing virtual accounts into personal accounts are allowed. If the bank allows withdrawal, but stops deposit, the existing virtual account transaction will disappear. We are simply canceling a virtual account contract with the Korea Virtual Monetary Exchange, said an official at Shinhan Bank. Other commercial banks are likely to join the decision. We will not operate the real-name bank system, too, said an official at the Industrial Bank of Korea. We decided to gradually close our existing accounts, too. KEB Hana Bank is also in a very confusing situation, so it will make a careful decision on whether to introduce the bank by the deadline. A commercial bank official said, "" If the authorities give a clear signal that they would allow the real-name bank service, but under the circumstances, it was not acceptable to provide a virtual currency transaction account. "" As a result, the virtual currency exchange that transacts these banks would have to redirect to the so-called ' honeycomb account ', which holds many individual transactions under the corporate account, or apply a real-name bank service. A honeycomb account, in which many individual transactions are held under the corporate account, can not accommodate customers larger than a certain size due to difficulties in keeping accounts. The assessment that it can not be an alternative to virtual accounts is dominant. If the financial institutions of Choi Jong-koo, chairman of the Financial Services Commission, all try to suspend virtual accounts, the virtual currency transaction could go beyond a mere deflation and become negative offline. A commercial bank official said, "" Aborting the use of a real-name bank account and eliminating existing accounts would in reality be refusing to pay payments to the exchange, "" adding, "" We can declare a virtual currency exchange more effective than an effective payment settlement. "" Banks will hold a meeting on the afternoon of the same day under the authority to discuss whether they will provide virtual account services and their real names. A "" extreme remedy "" to close the existing virtual accounts used for virtual currency transactions is also expected to be established here. speed@yna.co.kr"
