Considering the precedent in which the two Koreas have fought over the venue, schedule and format of the event, it is highly unusual for the government to show its willingness to improve inter-Korean relations. South and North Korea are proposing to normalize the communication channel between the two Koreas on July 2 and on July 3, respectively, starting with the New Year message of Chairman Kim Jong Un on July 1. In fact, many in the Unification Ministry also observed that North Korea is more likely to make a revision to the proposal than accept the offer of a high-level meeting on July 9. First of all, North Korea seemed to focus only on its participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in connection with the agenda of the talks. Ri Sun-kwon, head of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, practically defined the meeting as "" an inter-national meeting between the North and South to dispatch South Korean delegates to Pyeongchang's Olympic Games. "" This would make the talks more likely to be working-level than high-level. However, Lee said in a total communication statement on the issue, "" Let's accept the North's offer to participate in the Pyeongchang Games and improve inter-Korean relations, "" adding, "" Let's discuss the North's participation in the Games and discuss the issues of mutual interest. "" There were many predictions that the date of the meeting would be moved back too. North Korea`s leader Kim Jong Un is expected to make a revision to his proposal on July 8, the day before the planned meeting, and Pyongyang could change the date to be one of the "" energy wars. "" Some say North Korea was Moon Jae-in (10) the president's news conference talks at the sight of the observation, but that all off. A government official said, "" I thought North Korea would answer our proposal today, but I honestly did not expect it to be accepted. "" The biggest reason for North Korea's aggressive attitude is initially because it contains the strong will of Kim Jong Un. In his New Year's speech, Kim expressed willingness to send delegates to Pyeongchang, saying, "" The North Korean authorities could urgently meet with each other to discuss this, "" in effect. Chairman Lee Seon-gwon said on July 3, (Chairman Kim) I have also given specific instructions on how to urgently draw up practical measures with the South Korean authorities in a serious manner and attitude. "" In addition, the fact that the two leaders agreed not to hold joint exercises during the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics on July 4 might have helped North Korea make a proactive decision. North Korea was expected to respond to the talks based on its New Year message, but the decision yesterday by the two leaders of the two countries could have drawn more enthusiastic responses from the North, said Professor Kim Yong-hyun of Dongguk University. transil@yna.co.kr Many workers, including low-paid Arviete, say they expect the day to come with a minimum wage increase. However, there are some side effects that were concerned. There are workers who receive notice of layoffs, there are job insecurity and conflict. SBS's Report + is reporting what's going on in an apartment today after its fourth most-raised minimum wage increase.■ "" Cost problem "" … All 94 security guards were notified to fire at an apartment complex in Gangnam. It was a controversial place, using expedients to increase security guards ' time off to reduce the burden of minimum wage hikes. It is old Hyundai Apt. in Apgujeong-dong in Seoul. Security guards here received a bolt out of the blue on July 28.  All 94 people were scheduled to be laid off at the end of this month.The residents ’ meeting cited difficulties in managing their expenses and costs, such as raising the minimum wage. The council says it will provide future security for all security personnel, and the company will re-enlist the current security guards. Security guards asked to reconsider switching services, but finally received a notice of dismissal.Under the current Labor Standards Act, layoffs are carried out with urgent management. They should make efforts to avoid layoffs and discuss them with the union faithfully.SBS tried to listen to the resident representatives ' meeting, but refused to comply.■ It costs just about 3,750 won more. "" Some residents wrote a counterargument saying, "" If you only add thousands of won per month, you can hire security guards as they are, and that's hard to do. ""The message that one resident posted inside a complex when she heard about the conversion of security guards into service. They say the change in service means job insecurity and the dangers of layoffs, and the biggest loss of jobs is directly related to the family's livelihood. He says he does not want to repay security guards who have served the residents with job insecurity and layoffs.The minimum wage increase was about 300,000 won per month per security guard. The writer says the money, when divided by generations 1 apartment and 84, is 35 to 70 won, and that should not be too much of a burden. The resident, who said she moved from her junior high school to her 12th year apartment, was identified as an incumbent female prosecutor. Some also criticized each other's opinions by interpreting the intent of the law's clauses on the notice that security guards should be switched into service providers. In fact, more than one thousand of the 3,000 people in the apartment have signed up to object being laid off as security guards.■ Realization Case Realistics…This apartment building is not the minimum wage as a result of conflicts between the government and the previous meeting. And there is no doubt in society that the minimum wage should actually be raised to the minimum standard of human life. However, the government announced a job security fund measure last year, as it was worried about the possible side effects of job avoidance and layoffs due to massive minimum wage hikes. Each company with less than 30 employees receives 130,000 won per year. However, we announced that in the case of apartment guards, we will apply for more than 30 people. Especially for apartment security guards, they were concerned about being fired for the minimum wage increase.  But was it enough? It has been reported that recently during an on-site inspection by the Strategy and Finance Ministry, many employers have chosen to fire their employees rather than continue hiring with job security or other funds. As some have raised concerns over the huge minimum wage hike, the government is rushing to organize what it calls a "" walk-off wind "" to reality. Today, the National Assembly of the Minimum Wage Task Force at 11:00 p.m. by the Seoul Metropolitan Government Office was responsible for the ongoing inspections and future actions. Interest is growing in what the government will do in the future, and how it will address concerns about job losses."
"Lawyer Choi Hwan recalls a fatal killing case of adviser Park Jong-cheol, the background of the movie ' 1987 ' in his office in Seocho-dong, Seoul, Tuesday. At the time, he was then the chief of security at the Seoul District Public Prosecutors ' Office, and prevented a conspiracy to cover up an alleged torture. Consultation-General Yoon Seong-ho, the Seoul District Public Prosecutors ' Office's chief of public security in Seoul, ordered us to direct our public prosecutor and prosecutor Park Se-won's body to watch out for us, saying, ' We've even died of shock due to the species. The desire for freedom and democracy, which had been kept on the bank for decades, has broken loose, sweeping the streets, squares and the whole society. The bank's gold mine was killed on January 14 of that year by a murder by torture, Park Jong-cheol. At the time, the head of the National Security Agency (present police chief) tried to cover up the truth, saying, When I knocked on my desk, I was violent and die. Park Jong-cheol's death, who was nearly buried in a simple shock, could have been revealed to the world with the spirit of then Seoul District Public Prosecutors ' Office Chief Choi Hwan. Although most of his time was spent investigating public security officials, he reportedly overcame the brutal pressure with a conscience : The nation should not take away any lives of its people. The prosecutors ordered the preservation of the bodies and an autopsy instead of cremation to ensure that the first step is to investigate the truth. The film, titled "" 1987, "" directed by Jang Joon-hwan, copied the poster, "" Their choice changed the world. "" Choi, played by actress Ha Jeong-woo, is the chief prosecutor Choi Hwan 30 years ago. Choi Hwan, a law office in Seocho-gu, Seoul, met him on July 3 and asked what happened 30 years ago. He was working with a female employee in a small office without a sign.I think the memory of 1987 will be special. "" 1987 was a great year. Park Jong-cheol was found dead on January 14, and on April 20, the main opposition Democratic Party of Tongil (DP) was involved in what was called the Yongfali incident. Yonsei University student Lee Han-yeol was hit with tear gas on June 9 and Korean Air blew up on November 29 before the presidential election. As he was a security manager at the Seoul District Prosecutors ` Office, he directly and indirectly engaged in all of these investigations (not just under the Seoul District Public Prosecutors ` Office, but also under the influence of the Seoul District Public Prosecutors ` Office, Lee Jong-yol and the West Coast Guard, and Uijeongbu District Public Prosecutors ` Office were involved in the change of politics in June 1987. We were asked to attend the preview. Before then, I didn't even know if I made a movie. CJ Entertainment said it received investment, and CJ also had a movie called "" The Lawyers, "" and wasn't it out of touch with the previous administration. So I heard that you were careful with your shots. In the movie, I took a bottle of whiskey confiscated by Ha Jeong-woo and drank it while the phone rang. My face is red now. Because I drank a bottle of buckass in the morning. I can't drink a drop. Even during the exam, he never yelled or kicked with excitement. Haha. I remained calm on January 14. I understand it is a movie setup though. "" - Explain again the circumstances of Park Jong-cheol's death. It was about 7:40 p.m. on Jan. 14. Two senior security officers came to visit and handed in a report saying ' One student was killed during the investigation. The police doctor says the shock death is most likely. Now that I have an agreement with my bereaved family, please direct them to wear makeup tonight. ' Some even stated, "" He died a violent death with a bang. "" As soon as I saw it, I had a hunch that it was torture. I will treat it as a formal speaker's case tomorrow morning, so I have to write in the report of occurrence. Investigators said, "" I trusted the manager (who signed me) and they wouldn't. "" However, who would easily agree to the cremation without seeing the body of their son who entered Seoul National University with difficulty? Finally, the next day, the chief of police in Yongsan brought in a report on the incident. At that time, the power of the Jangmyeong-dong commando unit, which was located at the head of the Korea Coast Guard's Anti-Commissioners Bureau, was stronger, and actor Ha Jeong-woo played the chief of public security in the movie. `` People who entered the office at 7:40 p.m. did not show up to 10 p.m., so I said, ` You are blocked at the chief prosecutor's office. ` The head of the prosecution, the head of the public prosecutor's office, and Chang Se-dong (then director of the National Security Planning Agency) also called. It is of the interest of the Your Excellency. "" In the movie, Park Chat-won (Kim Yoon-seok) appears to be running wild, but Kang Min-chang, head of the National Security Agency, talked to me the most. She said, ' My children have made some mistakes and I want you to see them. ' Since liberation, he has been a great movie character for catching Communist Party figures. He later told me, ' It won't be fun. Be careful on the night road. ' I thought 100 percent of the security chiefs were with us, but they betrayed me. I slept at my brother's house that day. She said, "" I've been on the phone all night. "" She said, "" I'm the chief of the security and I never cooperated. "" She said, "" What if a nation that protects its people's lives, its property, its liberty, takes away its people? Park did nothing wrong and let a year's senior stay at university. Prior to this, Kim Geun-tae was involved in an interrogation in 1985 and the Bucheon Police Station had a sex consultant scandal in 1986. It was time to hear from all around that someone had been tortured to the point of going to work. Seeing her attempt to kill and conceal a 21-year-old undergraduate student, she was immediately reminded that ' Torture is the only thing that should be done. ' - She was mainly involved in criminal security investigations. We have always met the 386 generation in the Public Security Ministry`s investigating room. When the students showed up in protest, they said, ' I did a lot of tough demonstrations. It is not something to be done on asphalt, but to be a social leader and fix, ' he said. I am also a generation of 64 years old. Lee Bu-young, Kim Jong-nam, is my friend in politics at Seoul National University, and former lawmaker Kim Deog-ryong is my colleague at the College of Culture. The movie says that Lee is sending Kim Jong-nam a pigeon (secret letter in prison) with a story of torture, concealment, and reduction, and in fact, goes through Kim Deog-ryong further. The reclusive Kim Jong Nam, it's hard to see, but the rest of us motivation sometimes spend.

When I was a prosecutor at the Daejeon District Public Prosecutors ` Office, I was sent to the Interior Determination Committee of the National Security and Emergency Response Commission in August 1980. As I stood up to not go, a security guard called and said, ' If you don't go, I'll take you in. ' I saw Chun Doo-hwan's practice to the president of so-called ‘a gym’ was the Standing Committee of Special Committee for National Security Measures. Then, what Jeon frequently said was, I will create a society in which justice flows like a river. Later, he was questioned on bribery charges involving hundreds of billions of won, and said, ' Justice will make the world run like a river. ' What is this about? ' The answer is no. "" - I saw the plaza in 1987 and 2017, and I saw what small council it was. Last year, we went to both candlelight and taegukki rallies. Complaints and anger from the government and the political circles were the cause for both 1987 and 2017. Both of them succeeded. In 1987, democracy and constitutional reforms, 2017, was president drew a lot of impeachment. It was the result of the citizens and students ' movement. However, those who want to ride on should be careful.

"3. When the animal remains were recovered from decomposition by temperature and humidity, the time of death was estimated using flies, beetles, moths, and ants. They placed a dead pig in a dense, shady place between the building and the building. After that, he visited the same place every day for more than a month, checked the bodies, and kept a detailed record of their conditions. Park Seong-hwan, a professor of forensic science at Korea University, and his fellow researchers were there. Park Seong-hwan, a law and medicine professor at Korea University's School of Medicine and his junior researchers are using the carcasses of pigs for research in forensic entomology. The experiment was conducted, explained Park. Each time, the temperature, humidity, rainfall, and intensity of the corresponding place were recorded on the records. In particular, the key observation was what kinds of bugs or insects grew as the decomposition progressed, and how they changed. The research team's experiment was part of the Development of Post-Ratement Programmations Programs Using the Legal Insections. The project is being carried out at the Research and Development Project Center of the National Police Agency, which includes Professor Park and Professor of Biology at Koshin University, Moon Tae-young. The purpose of the research is to create a police investigation system that can predict the time of death through flies that were found in the bodies of criminals. Finding out when to die makes it easy to track down the suspects. He`s the first sampling bug data police in the world are developing a source technology that can apply the epicureability insects that gather on dead bodies at all times. We plan to make a demonstration program and test it by the end of this year. Foreign police, who emphasize scientific investigation, including the U.S., also use forensic entomology to investigate. However, according to the business group, no country has organized the use of varied tasting insects, including local, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and lighting, depending on the environment so long as they can be used for data reconciliation. In the case of the United States, the size of the land limits government efforts to produce such data, said Kim Mi-na, head of the business group. The ‘ Minimum Post-periodation Time Estimation System Using Insection evidence ’ demo Welcome screen. The target insects that the police are using as data for their research and development are flies, beetles, moths, and ants. These insects lay their eggs on the bodies when people die. The earliest insects to arrive at the body are usually flies. This means that the time of death can be estimated by tracing the age of the oldest living creature among the larvae, pupae and adults found in the bodies. Although it depends on the temperature, humidity, and light levels, beetles are often found around 14 days after death. Among the tens of thousands of species of insects, the group is investigating all kinds of edible bugs found in the nation. Moon's team has analyzed 95 species so far, and Park's team has analyzed 37. Data are also being compiled to estimate the age of a person according to their discovery status. Furthermore, DNA analysis is being conducted to identify the phase-specific expressions. Using the forensic entomology can tell not only when they died, but where they died or if their bodies were moved, explaining that insects found in different regions suddenly vary and also in the cases of bodies. Hey.6 Former chairman of Samgak Group Yoo Byung-eon, who was suspected of being the actual owner of the number of years after the death of Sewol Owner Yoo Byung-eon, died in Suncheon, South Jeolla Province. Forensic entomology is a material that frequently appears in movies and dramas. The film "" Dead Man Walking-1995""was a film that gave actor Susan Thurand Sean Penn an Academy Award for Best Actress and a Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival. The suspects, who have denied the charges, finally confessed to the police questioning him, who estimated the time of death at the age of the fly maggots. The first method of using insects for research started in France in 1855. A baby body was found behind a fireplace while renovations were made to a Paris house. Police estimated that the baby larvae and moths nearby killed him around 1848. Based on this, the culprits were arrested. Graphic : journalist Park Kyung-min and journalist Cha Joon-hong minn@joongang.co.kr and a walking analysis are also developing a "" legal step "" technique to identify criminals by identifying different walking characteristics among three-dimensional database users. The first place that the legal action to take effect was in Britain. British investigators were found guilty of taking legal action in 2000, making it the first time for them to be found guilty. The Daegu High School law also sentenced a 31-year-old criminal to life in jail in May last year, based on the criminal's unusual walk on CCTV. Park had a habit of walking with her left leg turned inward and outward. The person with the sensor and measured's foot is an input into the computer. Because it is three dimensions, it is possible to turn the screen up and down and analyze it. The police asked SNU (Bundang Seoul National University Hospital) and JoongAng University (JoongAng University) to analyze Korean people's walking patterns more closely. Because it is judged that the analysis of legal steps can be more detailed if the proportion of people who walk on god-to-man walking is higher, and if the average person knows what joint movement is like when they walk. A measurer at Bundang Hospital of Seoul National University walks with 29 sensors on his body. If the analysers walk with 29 sensors on their arms, legs, or feet, infrared cameras and special sensors measure the exact movement. If more data are accumulated, various walking patterns will occur and the ability to identify suspects will increase, said Lee Kyung-min, an orthopedics professor at the hospital.

"[Donga Ilbo] [Fire Department : Nothing is allowed to park illegally.] On July 4, two sprinkler vehicles installed on the outer wall of a building in Jongno-gu, Seoul were illegally parked in front of a fire hydrant facility. In the event of a fire, the pipeline connects to the fire hose of a fire truck to provide water to sprinklers in the building. The only parking penalty is 40,000 won. Jeon Young-han, a reporter at the Seoul Conor General, said, "" I want to go to the shopping mall on the sixth floor of Yeonseo-ro, Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul on July 4. Three ' connecting sprinkler water pipes ' were visible near the entrance to the tower parking lot behind the building. A link sprinkler system turns off the heat by automatically applying water to the basement when a fire breaks out. A water inlet is the connection between a building and a fire pump car. Two cars were just in front of the water inlet. There was no time for a person to approach. The parking lot entrance was in a dead end and there was no room to move the car when the fire engine entered. A building manager Kwon (79) said, "" The car was temporarily placed here to renovate the car park lifts. We just have to connect the fire hoses, but it`s not that bad at all.○ According to the Fire Explosives Traffic Act (Article 33), you can not park within five meters of fire extinguishers, fire hydrants or water pipes. Violations will be fined 4000-50,000 won. In addition, it is prohibited to store items around fire prevention facilities. However, citizens agree, "" I don't know what it's for because I don't see it very well. "" And they don't hesitate to park illegally, saying, "" We don't have enough parking. ""Inoperability to use fire fighting facilities at the start of a fire could lead to disaster. Usually it evolves into strong pressure water from fire pump cars that are on site in the event of a fire. However, when water is running out on the fire pumps or the water tanks of the building, the fire must be put out by using fire hydrants and water pipes. We should assume they are the only ones using fire hydrants in the event of a big fire, said one firefighter in Seoul. In the event of a small fire, it is a rule to secure nearby fire hydrants. Fire hydrants are divided into indoor and outdoor fire hydrants. Outdoor hydrants are divided into ground, underground systems. Indoor hydrants are installed in hallways or on interior walls. When it is difficult to control the fire with the fire extinguisher at the beginning, it can control the fire with strong pressure. Shall be installed on a building with a gross area of not less than 3000 m ². The fire hydrant was set up to get water when a fire pump car ran out of water at the fire. It is the red fire hydrant we usually think of. It is installed primarily on the boundary between roadway and sidewalk. Connect the fire to put out the fire in a place where fire trucks can not approach. The subway system is designed to compensate for the shortcomings of ground-type fire hydrants that cause inconveniences to transportation and are likely to freeze in the middle of the cold. Gas hydrant stand under a manhole cover. When you open the lid and plug in a bar-shaped wrench, the fire hydrant is up into the ground. Various easy access ports are also important. However, many people are not familiar with the role of water pipes. A water inlet provides water to the fire engine when a fire occurs. If you park illegally near the water hole, it will break the hoses, so it is hard to get water to flow properly, said a fire prevention department professor at Kyung-il University in Seoul. ○ Check the hydrant in front of your home to see if it is easy to distinguish underground hydrant from other manholes. The fire hydrant needs to conform to technical standards and be marked as "" outdoor fire hydrant, "" according to the fire department. Underground fire hydrants are less visible, but there is no indication to compensate for these shortcomings. Local governments or their local fire department have yellow paint on the manhole covers, but this is not a mandatory either. Even the water pipes do not catch your eye. Choi (42), a courier whose truck is parked in front of a building in Jangchung-dong 1-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul, said, "" Even if I know the policy, I don't think I can see anyone in front of me who knows how to park in front of a hundred. "" People need to be more willing to check the fire hydrant and water pipes around my home and office. A 57-year-old man who usually parks a car on an underground hydrant in front of his home said, "" If anything, I'd like to make sure it's my own car makes you feel good. "" And the government should know that it's a good thing.

The illegal fishing and fishing operations of Chinese fishing boats, which began last October when the fishing season in the West Sea was broken, are getting worse and worse.About 50 60 to 80 tons (t) of Chinese fishing boats flocked to work illegally on Saturday morning off Gageo Island in Shinan, South Jeolla Province. In response, the Korea Coast Guard's task force issued a warning to get rid of the boat, but did not listen to it, so they began cracking down on it and captured two fishing boats first. The other Chinese fishing boats collided with the Coast Guard's patrol boat, creating a situation similar to that of battlefield.Dozens of Chinese fishing boats armed with wire and steel bars surrounded Mokpo headquarters's 1,500-ton (t) class 1508 warship, and finally, the Coast Guard fired a fire with a personal K2 rifle, and fired a public use of fire. It was not until the Chinese fishing boats were shot that the Coast Guard took two seized ships to Mokpo. About 40 Chinese fishing boats illegally fishing off Gageodo Island were found last month, and the Korea Coast Guard fired around 200 shots to stop them.Actually, the Chinese fishing boats ' behavior is not a recent issue. The annals of the Joseon Dynasty already contain records of fishing boats from King Sukjong and King Yeongjo's reign, as well, as well, as it is known as the ‘ Hwangdang Line ’ and as the ‘ Bangmunsa Temple Site of Cancer ’. In modern times, Chinese fishing boats and Coast Guard personnel who invaded Korean waters have been struggling since the Korean War.In October of last year, Chinese fishing boats (photo = Yonhap News Agency) arrested during illegal fishing operations were also in a shootout with Chinese fishing boats armed with South Korean coast guard patrol boat Cheonwoo. At that time, many Chinese fishing boats were known to have been using firearms and pirated goods as a result of the Korean War on the Deda, founder of modern China. During the fight between the two sides, the Chinese fishing boats fled to China, carrying four of our own guards, and they were detained in China for 12 years before they returned. For nearly 70 years afterwards, the battle between the Coast Guard and a Chinese fishing boat continued.The fishing fleet illegally fishing vessels in China is getting more violent every day. Chinese fishing boats are resisting even when shooting live ammunition because they will be fined first when the ships are captured and punished twice by Chinese authorities when they return to China. Normally, owners of ships would pay fines to their crew, and the Chinese authorities would resist the Chinese authorities ' decision to impose more punishment on ships and ships, since Chinese authorities tend to punish them more heavily than Korean counterparts. Back in 2015, U.S. Aegis destroyer Lassenham used a 12-mile patrol operation to disrupt an artificial island base built by China in the South China Sea. In addition to the United States, some people in the disputed waters with Vietnam and Japan were also suspected of mobilizing the fishing fleet as if it were a private sea squadron before the warship was dispatched.Lee Hyun-woo, reporter knos84@asiae.co.kr"

In response, he said in an interview with a daily newspaper, wandering one by one, The proportional representation was elected by the people nationwide who voted upon the party. It is not a private one. The ruling camp has proved that it has no intention to act as a proportional representative for its opponents. Opponents are also arguing that it is possible that "" a self-execution is made by two-thirds or more of lawmakers who support it, "" but Ahn also denies it. The party rule, which requires more than two-thirds of its lawmakers to vote with their feet, is to make a decision by the Board of Ethics and Justice. The actual expulsion by way of a parliamentary vote is included in the code of ethics judges. Opponents immediately called it a "" Naero-Nambo fire.

If the road to the merger of the proportional representatives of the ruling party is blocked, it is expected that the reform plan, promoted by the opposition camp, will be difficult. Currently, three proportional representatives have announced their intention to join the reformist group, including Park Joo-hyeon, Lee Sang-don, and Jang Jeong-sook, because it is difficult to form a negotiating group if they can not join the reformist group. If the UNDP fails to form a parliamentary negotiating group, the cause of ` representing the identity of Honam Province ` will inevitably be paralyzed. Some do not rule out the possibility that the ethical judges themselves could drop out if the opponents ` proportional representatives who want to leave the party ask for a self-execution from the current ethics panel. The ethical judges who have the power to expel the party may decide to stop spreading the party's nomination. In a telephone conversation with Newsis, Uri Rep.

As global warming continues to worsen, the possibility of the heat wave becoming more common in the summer and cold snap in the winter has increased.Foreign media report that the eastern part of the United States has been frozen with heavy snow and cold weather from southern Florida to Maine, Canada. The National Weather Service issued a heavy snow and wind warning for the three states : New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.Snow is forecast to accumulate more than 1 foot (30.48 cm) in the Boston area, which is located in the New England area, which includes the six states : Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut.New York and New Jersey are seeing a lot of blind snow, and when the temperature hit minus 20 degrees Celsius, it went down to between 30 and 40 degrees.The National Weather Service predicts a gale of up to 89 kilometers per hour on the east coast, followed by a heavy snow fall. The city of Tallahasseo, Florida, a symbol of the warm resort, had its first snow in 30 years.Heavy snow canceled flights and closed schools on the front.Workers piled up at gates C and gate D of the New York Laguadia Airport and piled up on and around the terminal B and snow runway, amid damages from cold, strong winds and winter storms in the Northeastern United States. At Laguadia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport, flights to and from the airport were canceled due to white-out (caused by heavy snow).More than 3,000 flights were canceled at New York's Laguadia Airport and at John F. Kennedy Airport, each of which had 95 % and 27 % of scheduled flights, and at Newark Airport in New Jersey.Many schools have closed, and federal and state agencies have slowed down the commute or ordered them to work from home.U.S. media report more than 35,000 homes in Georgia, Virginia and North Carolina were blacked out, and at least 17 people died throughout the country, including two homeless in Houston, Texas.In Europe, winter storms are causing a wave of damage. More than 200,000 homes were blacked out in France, and winds of more than 117 kilometers per hour grounded flights at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris.In Britain, one person was killed and tens of thousands of homes were blacked out by strong winds, and trains derailed in Switzerland and Germany, close to 200 kilometers per hour.Strong winds accompanied by a typhoon, Carmen, on July 1 (local time), crashed and shattered the large wind turbines for power generation in the western French city of Buyen. France suffered a series of damages, including a major ceasefire due to Typhoon Carmen. [Photo Source = AFP] In Southeast Asia, the effects of frequent typhoons are growing. The first typhoon, called "" Bolaven, "" vanished one day after it hit waters about 510 kilometers off Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, at 9 a.m. local time.The second typhoon of June 14, 2017 and the 27th, Denvin, last month, have caused three typhoons in recent months. In an average year, it is more than double that of the 1.6 storms that occurred during the winter months.In the Philippines, 240 people were killed in the typhoon, and more than 100 were missing.◆ into the North Pole where jet drift is the most prevalent : weather experts say strong winter storms in North America and Europe are due to Arctic shaking, and storms in Southeast Asia are caused by SOCs, Southern OsllationArctic Oscillation (AO) is the difference in atmospheric pressure between the polar regions and the mid-latio regions, when the pressure difference is larger than normal, the positive (+) value and the pressure difference is smaller (negative).As the Arctic oscillation value decreases, the difference in atmospheric pressure, the jet stream surrounding the polar region weakens. The weakened jet stream flows slowly, like a snake crawling along, and when the jet floats south, the cold snap falls on it as the Arctic cools down.`` A cold snap hit as high pressure builds around the Ural Mountains and the Bering Sea and the southern jet stream between the high atmospheric pressure, '' an official at the Meteorological Administration explained. `` Now, the cold snap in eastern Greenland. ''The jet stream moves north of the Bering Sea and south of the Greenland high, toward the northwest to southeast, toward the eastern United States.Winter storms in Europe are for the same reason. Jets flowing north-easterly to the south of Greenland turned northeast, sparking strong winds in Britain and France.Frequent storms in Southeast Asia are analyzed by the effects of Lanigna's lowering of sea temperatures near the equator in eastern Pyongyang. Rather than lowering sea temperatures near the equator, Ranigna says the Pacific Northwest is warmer than usual, making it a good place to start a typhoon.A rise in sea temperature near the equator in Pyongyang is called El Nino. The shift from El Nino to La Nina and back to El Nino is referred to as Southern Oscillation (SO2) and Nino-Laniña-South Wave (ENSO).Glaciers in the melting Arctic The repeat of El Nino and La Nina due to global warming makes the heat and cold snap more likely to recur, which is intolerable in the summer and winter.[Photo Source : NOAA] United States Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says the most powerful cold spell in the world is Elino and Ranigna. The summer heat wave is mainly affected by El Nino and the winter cold snap is mainly caused by the La Nina, which also causes global warming.As global warming continues to worsen, heat waves and cold weather are likely to become routine, just as El Nino and La Nina repeat.Overall, rising temperatures produce higher temperatures and El Ninos, especially in the West Pacific, as the temperature of the warm water surface area increases, the gap between East and West Pacific becomes wider.After Super El Nino, it is very likely that a cold snap, La Nina will occur, and it is more likely that it will recur each year."" By the end of the century, global warming will have caused Super El Nino to double what it is today, and the ranina will have suffered 80 percent more than now, "" said an official of NOAA who said during the summer heat wave.Kim Jong-hwa, reporter justin@asiae.co.kr The banner photo, titled "" Ballroom and Ballingtong in the playground, "" shows a banner under the name of an apartment manager in Mapo-gu, Seoul, attached.

"Hackers break into a computer equipped with Intel chips and can easily steal personal information such as ID and password. Intel controls more than 70 % of the central processing unit (CPU) semiconductor market, the brain of the computer, and therefore, virtually all computers are exposed to hacking. Intel has also been able to identify the problem but has not done anything to it for more than six months. When the news was revealed, Intel shares plunged 3.4 percent on July 3.As Intel, the world`s semiconductor maker, faces a crisis following the battery gates of Samsung Electronics and Apple, critics say the curse of the first rank has been reenacted. Companies that perform solo acts in different fields fail to manage their quality and communicate with consumers, and will crash by themselves. As the top companies tend to believe in strong market forces and refuse to admit mistakes, they tend to fail to manage quality more significantly, said Shin Min-soo, a business professor at Hanyang University.The fact that Intel chip has a problem with fatal design and concealment has been revealed on July 2 by the British technology site Register. "" Experts have found a fatal bug in Intel's chip that could be misused for hacking, "" Register said, "" and it appears that the same problem exists with all semiconductor chips sold by Intel over the past decade. ""Semiconductor chips must have completely separate operating system (OS) such as Windows running the computer from the actual user using space. This is to prevent the user from randomly changing the operating system and then breaking the computer. However, Intel's computer chip, Core Processor, released from 2006, has a path through which users can accidentally penetrate into the space of an operating system. If we use the route, hackers could not only solve the problem of getting the user`s login ID and password but also break the computer`s own computer, said Kwon Young-soo, head of the Electronics and Processor Research Institute.Intel is known to have identified the problem a long time ago and then covered it up. According to the New York Times, Google and Gratz University of Technology in the U.S. first discovered the flaws in Intel chip companies last June. The research team immediately informed Intel, but Intel has been trying to sell the defective product without any clear action. Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Crochanik acknowledged in an interview on CNBC on July 3, "" I was informed of the problem by Google several months ago. ""◇ The global top companies in terms of quality are suffering from a variety of crises, ranging from Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG, to Samsung Electronics, Apple and Intel, which have been at the top of the world's top conglomerate. First of all, he says the problem is to perform solo for a long time and fall into arrogance. Hanyang University professor Shin Min-soo said, The overwhelming number one company has no competitors and is therefore more likely to fail to manage its business internally.Some also analyze that people tend to overvalue their own capabilities, and lack communication with consumers, and ignore any big problems. In reality, the makers of Toyota, diesel and Apple, who operated the gas-reducing device, secretly dropped the performance of their older iPhones, all failed to cover up and reduce the backlash.As the top companies expect more from consumers, it is easy for them to lose out on not only sales but also brand image, said Ju Dae-young, a researcher at the state-run think tank. According to the Chicago Tribune on July 4 (local time) and the weekly magazine Time of Internation, about 50 people in 13 U.S. and five Canadian states were infected by the disease. So far, 41 people in Canada and 17 in the United States have been reported infected with the disease, and one person has died in Canada and one in the United States. Canada and U.S. health authorities have revealed that long - bleeding Escherichia coli (O3) was commonly detected in infected patients. Health officials in Canada announced the cause of the food poisoning with romaine lettuce contaminated with E. coli. The CDC had not confirmed for the time being, "" an investigation is still underway, "" but Consumer Report, a leading U.S. consumer magazine, recommended using romaine lettuce as its own. Canadian health authorities also told the people of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and New Fund Land Labrador to `` avoid romaine lettuce until the exact cause and path was identified. '' The U.S. states reported infected patients were Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York, Connecticut, Virginia, Washington, and Nebraska. Health authorities in each state reported that all infected people ate Romane lettuce from one to ten days ago with symptoms of food poisoning. James Lazas, director of Consumer Reports Food Safety Research, explained, "" Romaine lettuce may need extra care because it is almost daily. "" Coliform infection is also caused by meat and dairy products. Most coliforms are harmless to the human body, but some may cause food poisoning, including vomiting, diarrhea, stomachache, or fever, and can have fatal consequences, especially for the elderly and infirm. Consumer reporter warned consumers that "" there is a possibility of contamination in all kinds of romaine, including packaged products, "" and warned of the need to clean up before eating, but warned of the dangers of infection.

The cold-hearted father killed her by trampling on April 25 with his foot on the floor's long, crestfallen lamb. Then she loaded up her daughter's body into the trunk and buried it in a hill in Gunsan with her mother, Kim (62).Goh Joon-hee, her father's father and his daughter who had been lying in false reports in front of reporters. Ko, a biological father, and Lee visited the police station on Dec. 8, 227 days after the death of the daughter, to receive false reports that their daughter had disappeared. After judging that the reason for his disappearance was unclear, police expanded their investigation against Ko and her family. Under pressure from the narrowing down the dragnet, Koh said he buried Jun-hee in the ground and revealed her abandonment and abuse of the body. Lee, a former wife of the Japanese military, and his mother Kim also confessed to being involved in the disposal of the body by police after repeated questioning. Based on their testimony, police collected the body of Jun-hee, who was buried in Gunsan Mountain. When the entire bizarre incident involving a father dumping his daughter into death was discovered, the whole nation was seething with anger.Goh Jun-hee's office announced the snack and chrysanthemums in front of her house on March 4. ' Jun-hee, I'm sorry I couldn't get you out. ' When the disclosure of her body, her dump site was completed. During the on-the-spot inspection, the words ' Hey you murderer ' and ' worse than the beast … ' burst out of the apartment complex. There were also sad cries about "" Jun-hee, "" and "" Why did you hit your daughter? Why did you kill her? "" all around. The entrance of the apartment where the woman was trampled on by her father's wife was filled with snacks with notes and chrysanthemum flowers. The keen remorse written on the memo made it clear to reporters who covered the inspection site. ' Aunt Junhee, I'm sorry I couldn't get you out.I'm sorry.I'll pray and pray for comfort, warmth and comfort, and the custody of the children, without the hassle of being left out in the air. ' Kim, who was arrested for dumping the bodies of Ko and Jun-hee together, will apply similar charges, police said. Police announced the circumstances of the investigation at a briefing on the day. The announcement also included circumstances in which Ko's father received custody benefits by decorating her as if she were alive and going on a family trip to cover up the crime. An autopsy report from the National Institute of Scientific Investigation said it is most likely that Jun-hee died from Ko's repeated assaults. Police explained that although the results were not a formal autopsy report, it is very possible that Jun-hee, who suffered from chronic illnesses and suffered from an external shock, died due to a damaged organ. We express deep condolences to the victim of her tragic death, said Kim Young-keun, head of the Jeonju Deokjin Police Station, who was in charge of the incident from beginning to end. jaya@yna.co.kr"

Lee, 37, told police that she stepped on her ankles and back several times before she died.

Apple lowered the cost of replacing the battery on the day of the controversy when it was revealed that it secretly defaulted the old iPhone, but angry opinions have not been eased. Samsung Group president Cook's responsibility for the sale of its new iPhone is also being swayed by what used to be called the "" battery gate. "" Although the government has set out to finance battery replacement, the new battery plan is likely to turn into a boomerang to carve out the new iPhone sales. Apple CEO Tim Cook is even blamed. According to the industry on July 4, Apple's astronomical amount of money was lost when it was revealed that it secretly lowered the performance of its older iPhone. Apple previously admitted to slowing down its iPhone's CPU processor behind the scenes to keep the old battery from going flat, and promised to compensate. The cost of replacing the battery for the iPhone 6 and subsequent devices was reduced from the previous $ 79 to $ 29. Given that Apple sells more than 200 million smartphones a year, Apple is expected to pay for replacing up to 470 million iPhone batteries in the future. Apple has money to throw away. Wall Street in New York predicted on July 3 that Apple's reduction in the cost of replacing its old iPhone battery will poison future sales of the iPhone. This means that the old battery will inevitably take a hit by replacing the new iPhone. Mark Moskowitz, analyst at British global investment bank Barclays, forecast Apple would lose approximately $ 10.89 billion (10.93 trillion won) in sales this year, with about 16 million iPhones being disrupted. It is estimated that 10 percent of iPhone users will replace their batteries, and 30 percent of iPhone users will not buy new ones this year. Market capitalization, which used to be the dream of $ 1 trillion (1062 trillion won), also plummeted. Until last December, Apple was the first company in the world to surpass the $ 1 trillion mark. However, the aggregate value of the market fell to about 939 trillion won from 968 trillion won on July 18. Despite the recent rebound in stock prices, the market capitalization of the firm has decreased by nearly 29 trillion won.Apple CEO Tim Cook said, "" It is a huge damages that can not be measured with money, such as turning its back on loyal customers. More and more Apple lawsuits against the company are spreading around the world. More than 15 class lawsuits are underway in five countries - the United States, Israel, France and Korea. As criticism is growing against Apple, many are complaining that Cook's leadership is not in evidence. "" Cook should be responsible for the battery scandal, "" said Insider, an economist at U.S. media outlets. Apple did not have Cook's signature on the statement, he said, pointing out that he is hiding behind the company`s brand.

"▽ Reduced number of apartments due to regulations, it is getting worse. '' … Attention is growing on property tax hikes and the cap on housing prices of private land (Yonhap news) Yoon Jong-seok : From this year, whether or not the government will raise housing prices further. According to the real estate market information released on July 5, the price of apartments in Seoul rose by 0.33 percent from last week. The rise rate this week was the highest since the global financial crisis in 2008, and Gangnam and Songpa districts reportedly saw a rise of about 100 million won in some areas. Although the increase in housing prices in Seoul has been limited to Gangnam, it seems that it is gradually spreading to Mapo-gu, Seongdong-gu, and Mok-dong. The Seoul Reconstruction Park saw its highest rate of climb this week at 0.74 percent since the government`s August 2 announcement. Recently, the prices of early business complexes such as Apgujeong-dong and Mok-dong have also increased. Experts say that although speculative demand decreased due to the government's regulations on real estate prices, the fact that sales in Gangnam area in Seoul decreased significantly led to scarcity of apartments. Experts who requested anonymity said, "" The increase in house prices now is due to the fact that the volume of distribution has decreased so much due to regulations such as the limitations of reconstruction-retation resells. "" "" Even before the April capital gains taxes were extended, it is smart to do so. "" As the real estate speculation zones, which have avoided the excessive profit sharing system during the reconstruction project in Seoul, itself are seen as favorable, and as the companies have shown a tendency to restrict the transfer of members ` status and restrict the sale of apartments, there is a lack of investment in the market. The government is also showing signs of tension as housing prices have soared since the beginning of this year. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport is struggling to come up with countermeasures by closely monitoring the market conditions, including various analyses of house price hikes as well as the volume of transactions. Among the measures that the government can put forward, the most influential card in the market is the reshuffling of the property tax. The government has announced that it would strengthen the holding tax for multiple people in the direction of economic policies this year and draw up specific measures through a special committee on financial reform under the Policy Planning Committee. Observers say the holding tax will be revised to increase the tax burden on multiple home owners by revising the comprehensive real estate tax. However, the property tax increase card can not be released until next year. In addition, the government announced last year that it would ease the requirement to apply the cap on the price of land for newly built apartments and apply it if house prices become unstable. Gangnam in Seoul is considered the top candidate. The requirement to designate a cap on land prices for new apartments on the land has increased by two to five times in the past three months, or by an average increase in the price of apartments in the past year ▲ and 1 year. However, while housing demand is high, a cap on the price of apartments could make the market more unstable by causing overheated subscriptions. Gangnam's main reconstruction complex has already applied for approval of management disposition plans to avoid the system, thus avoiding a cap on sales prices. Other possible measures were already announced last year. Seoul is already tied up with overheated speculation zones and speculative areas, and includes regulations on subscription and loan, including regulation on reconstruction. Short term speculative demand has also decreased due to the restrictions on the sale of land reconfigures, said an official at the ministry. We will closely look into the situation and come up with countermeasures since house prices have a combination of liquidity in the market and the economic situation, he added. ▶ banana@yna.co.kr article 1:1 ▶ In the latest trends, Defense Department and report and your reporter talks Heo Nam-shik, 4, controversy and ""There was no talk about uae"" … gimhagyong(=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) gimbeomhyeon Korea Kim Lee Seul-Gi reporters are free, Heo Nam-shik, the 5th is Defense Minister Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye (uae) and United Arab Emirates when the Government.Status of Forces Agreement, which, the agreement said the fact that, ' There is no argument.

"Cho Myung-kyoon, Unification Minister, is holding a press conference at Seoul's Seoul Central Government Office to discuss proposals for a high-level meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and North Korea in the afternoon of July 2. Minister Cho Myung-kyun said, We propose to the North that we hold high-level inter-Korean talks at the Peace House at Panmunjeom on July 9. Cho went on to say, "" We are willing to sit down and discuss the issue of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics North Korea participation, and discuss openly and honestly the issues of mutual concern regarding the improvement of inter-Korean relations once again, and the government is expected to make a point of concern. "" South Korean reporter Kim Ji-hoon, Seoul on January 9, will have a talk with North Korean officials at the truce village of Panmunjeom in order to discuss the worsening situation on the Korean Peninsula due to North Korea's provocations. North Korea notified at 10:16 a.m. yesterday that it would accept the proposal to hold high-level talks with the South via the inter-Korean liaison channel Panmunjeom. At the same time, the two sides suggested that they discuss ways to improve inter-Korean relations, including the Pyeongchang Olympics to host the talks. We have also sent a notice to Unification Minister Cho Myung-kyoon, in the name of the chairman of the Committee on Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, as expected, to ask for a counter seat. The meeting is expected to put North Korea`s delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and the Paralympics first. In North Korea, Kim Jong Un made it clear in his New Year message that the dispatch of the Pyeongchang Olympic delegation should be discussed immediately. Accordingly, it is expected to adjust the size of North Korea's Pyeongchang Olympic delegation, the route of travel to the South, accommodation, and international events. It is expected that the president of the delegation will be given a great deal of weight in this process. Choe Ryong-hae, vice chairman of the Workers ` Party Central Committee, is most likely to be mentioned. At the same time, the North is also likely to discuss the issue of the Gaesong Industrial Complex, which was closed due to North Korea's nuclear tests and long-range missile attacks, and the resumption of tours to Mt. Kumgang, which marks the end of 10 years. Experts say the Korea-U.S. joint drill could not be included in the key agenda since the two leaders agreed to postpone it on July 4. However, South Korea is said to be concentrating on strategies to limit the agenda to sports, Indian and cultural exchanges, including the Pyeongchang Olympics and reunions of separated families. Most of all, the U.S. and other international communities should consider the possibility of weakening sanctions against North Korea and pressure on North Korea, therefore, they should be cautious. 【 Seoul = New South Korean equivalent of 3 p.m. The North's Chairman of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland Li Shen-kwon announced on July 3, "" We will contact you via North Korea's Central TV channel starting at 3:30 p.m. (3:00 p.m. Pacific Time). ""Prior to the summit between the authorities of the Korean Central Television (photo), South and North Korea held a vice ministerial meeting in December 2015 but collapsed without even releasing a joint statement. At the time, the South referred to the North Korean nuclear issue and human rights issue as the agenda for the talks, in which the North unilaterally declared the talks would end, saying, "" The South has no intention to resume tours to Mt. Kumgang. Considering such precedents and the willingness of the two Koreas to participate in the Pyeongchang Games, it is forecast that they will refrain from mentioning the most sensitive issue at the high-level meeting. jikime@newsis.com> Internal response data for parliamentary response .... "" It is regrettable that the rescue team arrives at 4:06 p.m. and Golden Time is estimated at Jecheon Fire Station (National Assembly) at 4:15 p.m. when fire stops are announced. Yang Jeong-woo (Yonhap news agency), at vodcast@yna.co.kr (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) : Fire authorities did not attempt to enter the second floor immediately after the rescue team arrived at the site of Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province, which killed 29 people. Internal data compiled by the Small and Medium Defense Commission on July 5 showed that although the lack of manpower is present, the lack of rescue efforts on the second floor is not sufficient. As a result, it is regrettable that the rescue team should have tried to reach the second floor immediately around 4:06 p.m. when it arrived. In response to another forecast, the agency said, "" The first time we received a call from a woman on the second floor to report a rescue, etc., that was after the first call was made, that was at 3:59 p.m., and that the fire department was to survive. "" We cautiously estimate that Golden Time will be around 4:15 p.m. Therefore, it would have been possible to rescue the survivors by successfully entering the facility before 4:10 p.m. Some 20 deaths were reported in sauna rooms on the second floor of the complex building in Jecheon, and some fire department officials pointed out that the death toll is due to the problem of initial response. Bereaved families of the fire department have criticized the initial response, claiming that the fire department raised casualties by searching underground rather than on the second floor, where the highest number of people waited to be rescued. If you put together all the internal fire response data, you received a report of a fire at 3:53 p.m. on July 21, and the fire brigade arrived at the scene. It was discovered that the ship's fleet, which had 13 people including four people who evolved the fire, concentrated on suppressing the fire and preventing the explosion of the 2-ton LPG tank on the first floor of the building. Cho Hyun-hoo, an intern at the Jecheon Sports Center in North Chungcheong Province, is setting fire on fire at a scene Monday afternoon. The first sergeant, identified by his surname Yoo, saw priority in dealing with visible dangerous situations and concentrated on fire evolution and gas tank defense, who@yna.co.kr said. The Jecheon rescue team, which was sent to remove icicles from nearby areas following the launch, arrived at the scene around 4:06 p.m. The rescue team rescued one of the people who hung from the third floor windows after arriving on the scene and tried to enter the second floor using the stairs behind the building at 4:16 p.m. However, due to thick smoke, they withdrew, entered the basement of a golf range and tried to search for lives, but no one rescued them. The rescue team from Jecheon went back into the second floor at 4:33 p.m., when it was instructed by the fire chief to enter. Three of the workers, excluding the Jecheon rescue team leader, climbed up a ladder to the two-story window at 4:36 p.m. and broke through with an axe glass and began searching for their lives. However, it was long after the Office of the Little Bang's estimate of ` Golden Time ` was passed. When he arrived at the scene at 4:12 p.m., he was told by residents that a person was on the second floor, but the fire was setting off, and he was concerned about the LPG tank's explosion, and to better understand the fire. eddie@yna.co.kr The Cultural Heritage Institute of Koreans, Kim Ki-tae, head of the Center for Cultural Heritage, conducted an excavation at 2,200 ㎡, 787 Donae-dong, Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, and found 8,000 stone tools that were used 40,000-6,000 years ago. We have stopped digging because it is winter, said an official at the institute. The exact number of artifacts can be determined after the excavation is finished, he added. In Goyang, artifacts dating from the Paleolithic Age were excavated from the sites of Gawaji, DeogI-dong, Tanhyeon-dong, and Samsong-dong in Ilsan, in addition to Wonheung-dong. Around 500 stone tools from the middle Paleolithic Age were discovered in Kawaji ruins, and some 160 stone tools were found in the Samsong Residential Site Development District, but no such artifacts were found."" It is unusual to see a large collection of Paleolithic artifacts in a small area, "" said an official at the excavation site in Donae-dong, Goyang, Seoul. The official added, Stone tools may have leaked out of the site due to the steep slope of the site. The Paleolithic Age was divided into the electric, middle, and latter phases, depending on how stone was trimmed. Large stone tools were used entirely during the Paleolithic Age, but were then utilized as a layer of stone taken from stone during the mid-century Paleolithic Age. In the late Paleolithic Age, three strong-edged stone tablets were used. Seoul National University's honorary professor Park Hee-hyeon said of the high volume of stone tools that "" although the river may have flooded, "" the main stone structures of stone tools were possible around the excavation site. We need to extend the time needed to search the remains and proceed with further research, Park said.Paleolithic artifacts from Goyang.

"■ Let's connect with Yoo Byung-wook / Soonchunhyang, a family medicine professor at the University Hospital, to learn more about the current flu pandemic. You are connected to Professor Yoo Byung-wook of the Department of Family Medicine at Soonchunhyang University Hospital. Hello, professor?Hello?Anchor : I heard that the flu patient has increased a lot lately, how much do you actually feel?[Interview] As I just told you before, the CDC had 7.7 out of 10 outpatients in November, but by the end of December it had risen by about 53.6 persons and seven times.But this figure is more clear when you look at last year's, you know, December 2016 statistics. At that time, the actual age of primary, middle and high school was 13.3 to 61.4 patients per 1000 and 152.2. So this is the December 2016 standard. It was so much raised that they needed to defend it early, but it is known to be faster than it was then.[Anchor] That's right. And I heard that type A and B are in vogue at the same time these days.[Interview] That's right. You may be a little strange to type A and B. If we call it type A, it is representative of H1N1, which was a swine flu pandemic that hit our country in 2009. Type B is strange, but it is divided into Victoria and Yamagata. We have a plan to prevent 4 families who can get vaccinated only recently and have been vaccinated.Anchors : You told me you could get ready with vaccinations. People often think that a bad cold can lead to the flu, but they say it is a different cause. When can you suspect the flu?[Interview] I tell my patients, I don't forget to say, I explain that the virus that causes the flu, not the flu because it gets worse, is the other thing called influenza, and the flu virus. The flu symptoms are sudden fever of more than 38 degrees Celsius and general symptoms that lead to premature complications with respiratory infections such as pain and pneumonia.So your throat aches, your nose gets stuffy, or you have a fever that is more abrupt than anything, in that case, you'd better personally cover your nose or mouth and go see your doctor right away to see if you have the flu.[Anchor] Heat fever is a signal. [Interview] That's right.Anchors : You're watching TV, and you're getting vaccinated, but I'm sure some seniors aren't, and others aren't getting vaccinated even now?[Interview] That's right. Fortunately, the nation's health authorities were promoting vaccination in 2009 and 2010, predicting the flu to be very popular until 2017, 2018 and 2019. But while the vaccination rates are high among the elderly and the young, virtually speaking, they are not as severe, but they are less likely to be available in young people who can spread.Some of you might say it's late. As you can see in the report earlier, if it is B type, it is very popular in February or March. So even now, getting vaccinated may not be entirely preventable, but it may help alleviate the symptoms and avoid major complications.[Anchor] Okay. You'd better get a shot right now.

"- More TV viewing with smartphones and tablets - OTT servicesDisplay effects are growing [Herald Business = Choi Sang-hyeon and Jung Yoon-hee]. In just two years, the so-called couch potatoes, buried deep into the sofa and watching TV while eating potato chips, are not likely to be seen anymore.As more and more people leave their TVs for video clips using smartphones and more, the traditional definition of a TV viewer has quickly disappeared. The whole family sitting around in the living room watching TV has become an "" old story, "" and the altercation over the choice of channels will be left as a painful reminder.Erickson, a global IT company, forecast on July 5 that in 2020, only one out of 10 TV and media 2017 will remain as a couch potato viewer. On the other hand, watching TV using mobile is growing fast. Ericsson was expected to have seen by more than half of the audience as ' Mobility Centrics ' and ' MultI-device Viewers with Smart Phones, Tablet PCs and Computers ' in 2020. In fact, Mobile-centric viewers last year had 22 percent, more than quadrupled from the 5 percent recorded in 2010. By 2020, it is forecast to grow to 28 percent. MultI-device audiences are also expected to grow to 26 % by 2020. Last year, the ' MultI-device Viewers ' was 21 percent, up 6 percent from 15 percent in 2010. Since 2010, couch potatoes have declined by about 40 percent, while ' mobile oriented ' and ' multI-device ' are up 320 percent and 40 percent, respectively.Ericsson forecast that more than half of all TV and video viewing will be carried out on mobile screens including smartphones and tablet PCs by 2020. The video viewing rate of smartphones alone will reach 25 percent, a staggering 160 percent from 2010.

The world`s Netflix subscribers grew to more than 109.9 million last year, threatening existing networks. YouTube, the world's largest video platform, also accounts for 30 percent of all mobile traffic. The same is true in Korea. Korea`s OTT market is forecast to grow steadily to reach 7801 billion won by 2020. According to the Korea Communications Commission, the domestic OTT market size was 488.4 billion won as of 2016, a 53.7 percent increase from 2015 estimates of 317.8 billion won. The global OTT market is also forecast to grow at an annual rate of 15.8 % by 2020.As more and more people watch TV using mobile devices, the "" couch potato "" crisis is expected to accelerate. Market research company Imakketer reported last year that approximately 40 million U.S. consumers were expected to stop pay broadcasting and ‘ cutting-cutting ’ using OTT services within the next three years.

"Compared to servers or the cloud, personal resources tools were less dangerous (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) ; the recently released "" Meltdown "" and "" Spector Computing "" devices were found to exist on smartphones. Among these, the melt down is a flaw in Intel products only, but the spectrometer is present not only on Intel but also on other CPUs, including AMD and ARM. No hacking cases have been reported that the two security breaches were actually misused. If problems arise, multiple users will most likely log on to the server or cloud server, but in principle, even the devices used by individual users, such as PCs and smartphones, can not be trusted. The best thing personal computer users can do now is to apply security updates and patches distributed by CPU chipsets vendors and operating system developers. Updating your browser and keeping your antivirus program turned on, as well, should that be a contingency. Smartphone users simply need to apply the latest security patches Google and Apple distributed or are about to distribute.▽ Intel chip hacking vulnerability (PG) [MANUFACTURING] [EDITION] and _ OS update Microsoft (MS) has already released an emergency update patch for Windows 10, 8.1 and 7 SP1. Users can find Settings from the Start menu, then Update and Security → Windows Update, and then press Update Status, then Update OK. If the PC is not installed with an updated patch dated January 4, 2018 that prevents security vulnerabilities as a result of verification, it can be downloaded directly. Windows 10 is checked at http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4056892, Windows 8.1 is checked at http:www.catalog.update.microsoft.ascrosoft.as px? == KB4056898, and Windows 7 SP1 is checked at https Apple has already applied a download-protecting update to its Mac OS last month, the MacOS High Sierra 13.10.2. If automatic updating is not set, it can be updated from the ' Updates ' tab of the App Store. Google Chrome Book had security patches in its Chrom OS 63 version released last month.▲ Firmware update checks Intel, AMD and ARM companies distributed the patch through each PC manufacturer, including HP, Dell and Lenovo, or they plan to do so in the near future. Intel expects patches to more than 90 percent of the products with Intel processors shipped by the end of next week. Many recently released PCs are set to automatically detect the fact that chipset firmware has been updated when connected to the Internet, and apply the update after user approval. Intel has launched a tool called (https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/27150) that checks the PC with its chipsets installed to see if they have firmware updates, so you can do so using this tool.▲ Browser Updates Major PC browsers such as Google Chrome, MS Internet Explorer, Edge, Apple Sapari and Mozilla Firefox have released an update to defend the security vulnerabilities in question. It is recommended that the update menu for each browser reflect the latest updates.▲ Antivirus Updating Traditional antivirus programs do not detect an attack using a meltdown or a spector security vulnerability at this stage. However, if a malicious code is planted on a PC using these vulnerabilities, it can be caught by antivirus programs. It can not be stopped by 100 %, but it is certainly helpful. That is why Google's security experts say it is desirable to keep antivirus programs up to date.◇ For the case of smartphones, it is desirable for Android phones or iPhones to update their OS, security, and apps daily. Google, which first detected the problem and notified Intel and others, has already created security patches for Android and plans to distribute them between smartphones and telecommunications providers. Patches have already been applied to Android security updates since January of this year, and Google is also planning additional patches to further improve its vulnerability protection capabilities. Apple already applied the patch to its products last month, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, and is scheduled to release a safari browser update to defend against Spector vulnerabilities in the coming days.[Table] Update and patch for CPU chipset company·OS Development [Data services] Seoul Internet Corporation (KISA) [Refer to [8] https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.kr/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html [2] https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-responds-to-security-research-findings/ [2] https://developer.arm.com/support/security-update [4] https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/12/4/709 [4] According to the Health and Welfare Ministry and the National Pension Service on April 5, recipients of the national pension plan will receive a 1.9 percent rise in income from April 25. This is a result of the nationwide consumer price fluctuations of 1.9 % in 2017. Looking at the National Statistical Office's annual consumer price trend, the Consumer Price Index for 2017 was 1.9 % higher than in 2016. It is the highest level since 2.2 % in 2012. Considering that the average monthly wage of the total recipients of national pension as of September 2017 is 365,622, the average monthly income tax increase will be 63946,000 won (365,622 won). By pension category, 362,244,022 (monthly average 382,970 won) receive 7,726 won for senior pension recipients and 789,988 won for handicapped pension recipients respectively. In particular, the biggest pension beneficiary (1,998,280 won) receives 37,000 won per month and 2,028,95 won per month. It is the first time that monthly pension payments have exceeded two million won since the national pension system was adopted in 1988. The national pension fund increases its pension funds by reflecting the inflation rate every year. The purpose is to ensure a proper wage level. It is the biggest advantage of the national pension system, which has far advantage over the private sector's pension, which has to lose its real value significantly due to inflation. The pension gives an old-age pension when the subscribers reach the age of supply and demand, an disability pension when the subscribers are disabled, and a survivor's pension when the subscribers die, such as a spouse.Received National Pension (PG) [MANUFACTURING] shg@yna.co.kr ▶ Report and inquiry. 1:1 communication with reporters ; latest trends"

However, there is no clear standard on how the policies will reflect the opinions of the victims when they disagree. Diverse opinions are expressed about the victim's category. Minister Kang said the biggest flaw was the lack of communication with the consensus victims and the groups that supported them. However, there is controversy in diplomacy. It is necessary to listen to the opinions of the victims supported by the groups, but it is not fair for the group officials to consider the victims to be the same. Critics say groups that have expressed their opinions against the agreement are mainly focusing on them.
