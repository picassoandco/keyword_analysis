"CNN, Libya As the number of people leaving for Tripoli decreased, people were reduced to slavery and sold for 400,000 won per person at auction. Libyan authorities announced that they would start an investigation, adding that they would stop at 800 to 900 million won per person. "" Biddle di reu na (about 900,000 won)! "" is not used car, land or furniture. A mere child of mine The two men were sold like that. CNN reported on July 14 that the human auction market in Libya, Africa, was in contact with the Mediterranean Sea. The video that `` Cienne > "" exclusively obtained last August shows a Nigerian man in his 20s being auctioned off. Based on the video, reporters infiltrated the region near the Libyan capital of Tripoli last month and captured footage of the auction on screen. At sunset, a human auction was being held once or twice a month outside the city. Twelve refugees from Niger were seen being sold in the first six to seven minutes of the auction. When a man asks a crowd if they need a "" big strong man for farm work, "" they raise their hands everywhere and ask for a price. Such inhumane acts is believed to occur in places near Tripoli, including Chuwara, Zabrata and Garian. It is the only place confirmed by < Cienen >. Reporters tried talking with the sold men, but they were horrified and said, "" I can't talk. "" Cienne said human auctions for refugees from African countries are in vogue in Libya, the gateway to Europe. As Libyan authorities began to crack down on the anti-nationals, their dream of leaving for Europe was frustrated and the refugees caught by smuggling. The 21st Century Victory of Nigeria, located in the refugee detention center in Tripoli, was sold out into slavery after losing $ 278 (about 3.1 million) from her homeland. The smuggler forced him to pay off his debts and began asking for money from the families of the victory. He confessed, "" I was forced to work hard, but I didn't get anything to eat, and I was abused and tortured by electricity. "" `` My mother borrowed money from town to save me, '' he said, crying, `` It's so painful to think about starting again. '' His center was packed with refugees from Niger, Marley, Nigeria, and Ghana, with nowhere to lie. The Libyan Department of Illegal Immigration said the number of refugees using the state-run center rose from 7,000 in mid-September to 11,990 in early November. The United Nations believes that 700,000 refugees are detained in Libya before returning home to Europe. Libyan authorities announced they will investigate the auction market based on the report. Nasser Hazam, the head of the illegal immigration office, admitted that the gang was involved in trafficking. They fill the ship with 100 people, but they don`t mind if they reach Europe or die in the sea, he said. U.N. chief of human rights Jared Al Hussein issued a statement on the same day saying, "" The European Union's policy of helping to keep immigrants in concentration camps across the Mediterranean was inhumane, and refugees were deprived of their homes.

"The participation rate of Kim Ji-young in South Jeolla Province's economic activities was 93.4 % based on statistics and testimony in 2017. However, if a woman gives birth to a male college student without any discrimination due to her educational background, she pays 670,000 won more than a male student's Lee Soo-kyung (alias : 35), who has worked as a publisher designer for 12 years, quit her company last month and moved to Jeju Island where her husband is working. After marrying three years ago, he had his first baby on the weekend. I got some help living with my mom to continue working. After six more months of the birth of her second child, she finally raised her hands. "" I felt guilty because I felt frustrated because I wasn't loyal to my company, my family, "" Lee said, planning to continue working as a designer. She sent her first child, who was three months old before she gave birth to her second child, to a nursery. After maternity leave, her mother took care of her second child at home, while she was put in the same workplace as Lee's. However, when the baby was sick, her daily life collapsed. "" After school, I play with my sisters and brothers and get infected. If she's sick, she can't go to the nursery for more than a week, but her mother can't take care of the two children. I put in an annual leave. "" When he had no more to pick up, Lee resigned after a bite to eat out of his co-workers. A novel depicting gender discrimination from family, friends, and society in the average 82 year old woman, it is because it is our best seller of the year, ' Kim Ji-young, a former actress, said. Kim started out as a highly educated society when gender inequality was almost eliminated, but with marriage and childbirth, one in two gave up on work and family. Even if one chooses to live as a stay-at-home mom, one suffers from depression due to the loss of sense of accomplishment and self-esteem. Even though she continues to work, she earns less than a man and makes a living by staying in charge of childcare. According to the Labor and Social Research Institute's report titled, "" Analysis of Labor Market Status of Women Born in 82 years old, "" Kim's ' Today ' was made in 1982. It is a result of the National Statistical Office's analysis of the "" Regional Employment Survey "" in the second half of 2016. [The Hankyoreh] met six women born in 82 and looked at the Kim Ji-young's day. ■ One of the two married women failed to work as of October last year, leaving the economically active population (employed + jobless) at 248,000 among women born last year, a gap between 413,000 and 165,000 men. Men were 93.4 percent engaged in economic activity in 82 years, but women were a huge drop to 59.8 percent. In particular, women married (307,000) performed economic activities in 82 years was 51 % more economically than single (84.8 %) or divorced or widowed (83.4 %). This is also lower than the overall female participation rate (52.6 percent), which is 71 percent for women born in the 1970s and 57.1 percent for women born in the year of 58. Why are there so many Kims (167,000) not participating in economic activities? 31.6 percent of the respondents had ' childcare ' placed on their first fingers. "" Lack of training, skills and experience "" (20.4 %) "" No job matches the wage and working conditions I want, "" (18.3 %) "" I don't think so "" (11.3 %) would have any jobs that fit my major or experience. As of last year, women in their mid to late 20s (25-29) engaged in economic activities by 75 %. In the end, Kim's participation rate in economic activities has dropped significantly, reflecting the reality that many women quit their jobs after entering their 30s due to marriage, childbirth and childcare. Cha Ji-hyeon (alias · 35), who worked for a clothing company for seven years as a marketer after graduating from the visual design department, was frustrated when he tried to move out of the company in 2012. When I first worked at the marketing team, I was also a woman and felt little gender discrimination. I knew I would continue to work because it was fun and I got good results. I never thought that being married would be negative. "" In fact, he sent in five resumes, but the three of them said they were "" married. "" Without a "" Gimarrite "" sign on their resume, the two went through documents, but childbirth and childcare were hampered. "" In an interview, one company frankly told the marketing team that it is not easy for the other team to understand a married couple when they enter because they don't have any married people. "" The representative of another company told me directly, "" Don't you have children anytime soon? "" It was an external company that encouraged marriage and childbirth. "" Cha gave up being reemployed in 2014, and her first child was born and raised repeatedly in 2016. * Click on the image to expand it. Choi Soon-jung (alias : 35), who spent two years as a neuropsychiatry counselor at a hospital after earning a master's degree in literature therapy, gave birth to a married five years ago. She had a difficult time getting a child through a test tube but quit after eight months of pregnancy when she was told that there was a risk of premature birth. The life of a stay-at-home mom was hard. "" I feel like I don't get the credit. No matter how hard I work, I don't have any sense of achievement and feel satisfied. She's losing her self-esteem and feeling down in the mouth. "" At the age of three, she was sent to a day care center and Choi started working again. He applied for a counselor at an elementary school, but his pay was low and he was not being treated well. Her husband said he would help her raise her children, but she is afraid to work full-time because she is unreliable, Choi said. Still, I have a job because I am a professional. The mothers who used to go to the bank say they only have a mart, "" Kim said, adding, Even when they found a job, they had more non-regular workers such as part-time or part-time workers. Among female workers born in 1982, 67.4 percent were full-time and 32.6 percent were non-regular workers. On the other hand, 78.9 percent of men of the same age were non-regular workers (20.2 percent). When it comes to simple comparison, Kim's average wage was 2.19 million won per month, or 670,000 won less than an 82 year old man (2.86 million won). When it comes to men's wages of one million won, the women's wage is only 766,000 won. Regular workers earned 2.49 million won and temporary workers received 1.58 million won, which was 540,000 won and 620,000 won less than men. Women who received low pay (less than two-thirds of the median wage, or an average of 133 million won per month) in 82 years accounted for 19.5 percent of wage earners, while men of the same age had only 4.5 percent of lower pay. ■ Sexual discrimination is common at work. Yang Soo-mi (alias : 35), a publisher whose first job she worked for, frequently spoke of sexual harassment when she was in front of female employees in her 20s when she entered the company. `` I could tell you by the glasses or anything else that a woman would look pretty. '' When he quit his two-year job, Yang received confirmation letters from fellow employees who heard the director's remarks and handed it in to the president with a resignation. "" Kim Ji-young didn't even think about it. So was I. And I don't think you can take the courage and say, "" I don't think of a guy who's used to corporate culture in 11 years as being a businessman.

"" ■ What is the future of Kim Ji-young's 82 year birthday? I guessed the labor of a woman who was born in the same age, in 70, and in the same year, in 58. First, looking at the five major jobs of female wage earners, the 82 year old had the highest number of managerial staff, as were men. The following were accounting and accounting office workers, literary, technical and artistic instructors, administrative office workers, and store sales personnel. However, the first job for a 70-year-old man was a store salesman. Accounting and accounting officials were still second, but management staff fell to third. Instead, food service workers and simple manufacturing workers have moved into the top five jobs. The highest number of cleaning staff and garbage collectors were born in the year 58. The wage gap between men and women has also increased with age. The wage difference between a woman born in 1970 (1.88 million won) and a man (3.56 million won) and a woman in 1958 (1.14 million won) and a man (3.12 million won) was 1.82 million won (670,000 won), which is equivalent to an 82 year old student (2,500,000 won). As a result, 33.7 percent of female workers born in the 1970s and 56.1 percent of female workers born in the ' 58 were low-income. The commission said, "" Women in 1982 are more talented than those in the 1970s and ' 58. We need more than four years of college or higher education to solve the gender gap. "" It asked whether childcare, housework, or temporary work would require men to work for equal hours.

"Democracy is living ; I said I would throw shots at patients and stop them in gaudy clothes at sporting contests. I'm in the middle of a nurse's "" Burning Culture, "" where she says she can't pick on her juniors and get them to give them a ride. New nurses like me, along with my senior nurse, Preceptor, learn to work. One day, Pre-Septer stopped me for 10 minutes and gave me "" four-letter "". I admit I made a mistake, but I don't think I deserved to be insulted. He laughed as he ate. "" You used to kick me in the shin. You met a good world, "" adds one local hospital a friend worked for. Once, Su-sam called in a new song and threw away the charts by criticizing the mistake a few days ago. She even threw a syringe for the patient next door at her friend. Because of this, a number of new people, including friends, have resigned. According to a 2015 Korean Nursing Association survey, the average turnover of new nurses (past year or less) is 33.9 %. As the turnover rate is high, it also provides a hundred-eighty party and a stone festival to celebrate the fact that they have survived well. If it is not burning culture, I don't need these festivals anymore. 4 years, I was in a hospital nurse for a university hospital. After two months in office, I went to Su-sam and said, "" I'm going to quit my job. "" I was so tired because of the stress from work and the burning culture. Because of the lack of human resources, Su-sam desperately persuaded me. Shortly after, Chajisaem called me under Susaem. "" Isn't it rude to Su-sam? How do you say you're going to quit and get back to work? "" Chajisaem embarrassed for half an hour when all the patients, guardians and trainees at the lab were present. Tears poured down. After work, I got a text message from my senior two years ago. ' Still, Sam, do well after you ring once. Cheer up. ' Is this consolation? I could cry more. I can't even make plans for my children. It's because of the pregnancy turn. I saw a nurse who was preparing to get pregnant because of her turn to get pregnant go off with her younger nurse who got pregnant first. I understand. If one of them works the day shift or takes a leave of absence, someone has to replace him. Still, is this your turn to do it? ③ Hallim University Sungsim Hospital Nurse : I am the nurse who became famous for dance video on the Internet these days.

Nurses going on an organ show are required to report for one month to work at 6:30 in the morning, work until 3-4 p.m., and attend practicing until late evening. Military discipline among nurses, our hospital is no exception. DEAR ABBY : This time, an elderly nurse sent a letter of apology to a group of citizens who consulted about hangbats.

Do not regard it as a rite of passage or as an education and do not condone it. To make sure that nurses work with respect to each other, they need to address the shortage of nurses. The government should examine the nurse's work environment and consider ways to reduce the workload.

Lee's abnormal behavior appeared when he began to learn mathematics. Miss A attended the institute for three hours a week, three times a week, from fifth grade to fifth. If I did not pass the weekly test, I studied for 2 hours and came back home at 10 p.m. One day after several months, Miss A had alopecia areatorily. She complained that she and her friend grew up together and it is very hard for me to study the rest of them. But she felt "" it was the adjustment process and something to overcome. "" After a year or so, she was forced to pull her hair out repeatedly. And the consultation process at the hospital said, ' The others must have gone to unit ○○.I could not hide my uneasiness.○ Private education parents focused on their children are for their children, but the child's cry of crying out to be painful is the two faces of excessive private education, pediatric psychiatrists diagnosed.

"China's Supercom Instruction…China owns 202 out of the top 500. It is the first time that the United States lost first place in the Super Computer Ranking Survey since 1993. Supercomputers are high-performance computers that perform arithmetic operations thousands of times faster than normal computers.The International Super Computer Association (ISC) announced on July 13 (local time) that China has surpassed the U.S. by 202 of the world's top 500 supercomputers with the highest number of such computers, making it the first time for the U.S. (143) The ISC announces the list of the top 500 computers with excellent performance by assessing the computing speed and power efficiency of computers around the world twice every June and November. China has seen a whopping 42 supercomputers that ranked in the top 500 in the last five months, whereas the U.S. was ranked second with 26 fewer supercomputers than 169 in June. Japan (35), Germany (20), France (18), and Britain (15) followed. South Korea was only able to see the twin supercomputers "" Nuri "" and "" Pre-comer "" from the Korea Meteorological Administration ranked 57th and 58th, respectively.◇ China, Jill and Yang are the two strongest makers of supercomputer computers, and China, which has the world's best supercomputers, overtook the U.S. to dominate the supercomputer market. Sunway Thai Hurit, who is currently operating at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, remained at the No. 1 spot this year, following her first rank in the world last year.Researchers are inspecting the Tianhe 2 of the Super Computer at the National Supercom Puting Center in Guangzhou, China. China has the largest number of 202 among the world`s top 500 supercomputers as of November, surpassing the U.S. (143) for the first time. / China's fastest computer, Sunway Tifurit, has more than 3,000 computation cycles per second. It is more than five times faster than Titan, the most powerful supercomputer in the United States, who looks at around 7-50 a second. Tianhe 2 of the National Supercom Potting Center in Guangzhou, China held the title. Tianher2's calculating speed (3,380 per second) is also far ahead of other nations ' supercomputers. The United States ranked fifth through eighth out of the top 10.China leads the world market in supercomputers along with the United States. China's PC maker Lenovo produced 81 out of the top 500 supercomputers, ranking second behind U.S. HP (122). When adding the Chinese inspers (56) and the Sugon (51), three of the world's top five manufacturers are Chinese. What's more surprising is that China has developed its own core chip, which, in 2015, stopped the U.S. from exporting Intel's CPU (CPU) chip to China for supercomputers for national security reasons.Other countries stimulated by China's dominance are boosting investment en masse. The U.S. is investing 250 million dollars per year (approximately 279.4 billion won) to develop supercomputers that can run more than 100 operations per second by 2025. Japan is also planning to invest 19.5 billion yen (approximately 1918 billion won) in the development of next-generation supercomputers by next year. Germany, France and seven European Union countries agreed in March to jointly develop supercomputers against the United States, China and Japan.◇ Advanced countries that are required for infrastructure development such as artificial intelligence and big data compete for the development of supercomputers because supercomputers have become vital infrastructure for future industries. Supercomputers play a key role in the rapid and effective processing of big data such as the design of large aircraft, ships and cars, or artificial intelligence, big data analysis, and weather forecast.Korea is also constantly developing supercomputers, but global standards are wide apart from global standards, according to a general analysis. It is currently used only by the Korea Meteorological Administration, which ranks among the top 500 in the world's supercomputers. No Korean corporate supercomputers are on the list. Oh Kwang-jin, director of Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KISTI), is at the conference. "" Super computer's performance is now lagging behind in terms of technology and industry in that country, "" said the Director of the Center for Science and Technology and Information.The controversial painting is "" Wait, "" by Austrian bin painter Ferdinand Georg von Walderler, who is believed to have been painted around 1860.The girl in the picture of a 1800s is walking on a countryside.

The army is believed to have fled to the south to avoid a chase as it failed to pass through the MDL in a jeep.Then four North Korean soldiers with AK-74 rifles and a pistol followed and fired indiscriminately. About 40 shots fired, saying, ' Tatatatatang … ' went on for decades. Shortly afterward, North Korean soldiers were found covered in blood amid heaps of fallen leaves 50 meters south of the MDL. We have confirmed the location of the soldiers with thermal shock monitors (TOD) in the situation room, said a military official. Three South Korean officials approached the center and rescued the fleeing soldiers from the South Korean Joint Security Area (Lt. Gen. Kwon Young-hwan and the Military Academy), then moved them to Camp Bonifas, where they headed for the United Nations helicopter mission. We will make a strong protest to the North via UNC for violating armistice agreements on the carrying of rifles and shooting at the DMZ, the military official said. The army prepared for the worst with air and ground power. Two KF-16 fighter jets, which were on patrol in the West Sea during the rescue operation, were immediately moved over the first group in charge of the JSA. Two F-15K fighter jets are also on the alert. Fisheyai airborne early warning and control aircraft has also reduced wait times to increase surveillance of North Korean military forces. The Army's artillery alert status was also upgraded to level A. They are ready to fire back at any provocation from the North. All members of the Korean Coast Guard at the same time were ready to deploy their troops to the DMZ, and all soldiers from the neighboring division completed the deployment to the DMZ. ○ There is a possibility that some of the shots fired by the North Korean military pursuit team flew to the southern part of the MDL. Defense Minister Song Young-moo told the National Assembly`s Defense Committee on July 14, Isn't this the first time North Korean bullets were brought to us from the JSA? It is right, said Rep. "" We have assumed that the incident took place right in front of the MDL and that some of the bullets had crossed to the south, "" a military official said. It is also very possible that the North Korean army crossed the MDL during the pursuit. They say that the incident occurred right in front of the MDL and there were no related signboards, so the North Korean military might have invaded the MDL to prevent defection. A military official said, All possibilities will be left open for a detailed UNSC investigation. It is also noteworthy why our forces did not fire back at the North Korean soldiers who balled the shells. The military authorities explained that it was in accordance with the UNC rules governing the JSA. The firing is based on the right of self-defense when the North Korean military feels a life threat, such as shooting at an ally sentry. When some lawmakers told the National Assembly that the briefing was delayed, Seouk, director of operations at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, It is true that the briefing was delayed. It is a mistake by the working group, including myself. Minister Song also said, I was told not to make excuses for being late to tell the report because it was too late to attend the meeting.Yoon Sang-ho, a military reporter at ysh1005@donga.com, Sohn Hyo-ju and Park Hoon-sang.
