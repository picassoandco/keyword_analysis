Spot-driving, autonomous way-car-carrying vehicles [Photo Waymo Twitter Capture] The growing snow and cold cities of North America are welcoming ' stranger visitors ' this winter. These cars were the ones that heated up the automobile industry this year. The Financial Times reported on July 21 (local time) that car developers have encountered an unexpected problem and are sending autonomous cars to northern U.S. cities to solve the problem. It is to develop an adaptive technology for the snow falling climate, which should be addressed to the general public in earnest. Meanwhile, automobile developers have mostly tested their cars in San Francisco or Arizona. It is an area with a temperate climate and little unusual weather. General Motors (GM) tested on its second-generation cruise, an autonomous car, in San Francisco. Weimo, a subsidiary of Google's autonomous car development company, released a video clip last month that showed a fully-automated drive on its Phoenix public road, Arizona, without security guards. It is also provided for commuting by employees. However, the research focused on finding the destination by identifying signals or coping with the dangers of a contact accident on a typical road, not on bad weather conditions. Urba, a car sharing company, has also been studying the issue since last winter and said that although some progress has been made, there is still much improvement. This winter, Urber will experiment with autonomous vehicles in Pittsburgh, and Watermouth will validate the technology in Detroit, according to FT. New Tonomi, who gained independence from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), is set to experiment with an autonomous driving app in Boston, GM is scheduled to test a self-driving car in Manhattan early next year, and so there will be a busy winter. Developers ` winter tests aim to improve their ability to drive properly despite heavy snow and snow drift. However, developers believe that it is not easy to "" train "" automatic cars to drive safely on snowy or snowy days. `` Eye is a very interesting problem, '' said Carl Wellington, an engineer at Uber's Autonomous Driving Car Research Center, in an interview with FT. No company has disclosed that it has fully equipped itself with the technology to drive safely in winter weather conditions such as snow or ice. A video clip, however, was recently released showing a car in Finland driving safely on a road covered with snow, which VTT Research Center is currently under development. Following the route already entered, the car came to a stand together in writing and then stopped without a contact accident. However, no test runs were attempted in bad weather conditions that blurred vision. The biggest problem with heavy snow is that sensors in autonomous cars can recognize snow flurries as objects and cause confusion. The key equipment for current autonomous vehicles is the ' LIDAR (light detection and ranging '). The rider measures the distance by continuously firing millions of laser beams per second to calculate the time that the laser beam returns to the sensor. Normally installed on the roof portion of the car, it provides 360 degree viewing angle. Industry watchers explained, "" Having to prepare countermeasures to cope with the reduction of the rider's function on a snowy day is an urgent task to ensure full commercial use of autonomous vehicles. "" New Tonomi Chief Executive Officer Kalyuaknama said, "" The interesting thing is that the snow piled up around the road and drove away so that cars and everything else covered in snow look different. "" Still, the FT explained that in snowy conditions, autonomous cars could be probably safer for drivers than driving them. [Asian business reporter Cho Eun-im] _ Office worker Lim (40, Nam-nam) went to a hair salon in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, and found a steep rise in prices in one month. The cost of the trip rose by 4,000 won to 25,000 won from the previous 21,000 won. The hairdresser explained, "" We had to raise our prices starting next year as employees ' salaries went up. "" Although I heard that the minimum wage increase would raise prices, I was beginning to worry about the feeling of being this high, Im said. Lee (age : 30, female), who has been considering closing her coffee shop for four years, recently watched the news and began to worry more. As coffee shops splash in the number of times, they have been under a lot of stress due to frequent changes in the art industry, but they are finding it difficult to cover the extra cost. Lee said, We are currently recruiting Arvites and considering the cost of raising the minimum wage, it may be better to close our business. Beginning in January next year, the lowest wage increase of 16.4 percent, the highest ever, has caused a noticeable shift in living conditions close to those of the working class. In the high-labor service sector, the minimum wage increase is reflected in sales prices. Small businesses and small businesses are increasingly considering hiring less workers or closing down due to the burden of labor, the report said. A price increase had already been forecast. A report by the Korea Labor Institute analyzed on the impact of wages by industry on prices in 2015 showed that when the minimum wage increases by 10 percent, the total price increase is about 0.2 to 0.4 percent. Applying a minimum wage increase rate of 16.4 % results in an increase in prices from 0.32 % to 0.65 %. The institute estimated that the inflation rate of agricultural, fishery and service industries, which includes low-wage, lower-paid workers, would be higher than that of manufacturing industries. As the year ends, the restaurant industry is forgetting how much it costs. Seolnongtang, a specialty franchise for seolleongtang, raised the price of its main menu from 1,000 won to 3,000 won earlier this month. Representative menu, ' Seolnongtang ' has increased in price by 14 percent from 7,000 won to 8000 won. ' Nolbu Budae Jjigae Stew, ' also recently raised the price of its main menu, Budae Kap, by 5.3 percent from the previous year. It raised prices for the first time since June 2010. Indeed, small businesses see the minimum wage increase as the most difficult factor to make in management next year. According to a survey of 273 small and midsize businesses with fewer than 300 employees conducted by the Korean Federation of Trade Unions, 42.7 percent of them said the minimum wage hikes could lead to job cuts. Small and mid-sized enterprises also mentioned increased prices (21.4 percent) and expanded automation (19.5 percent). Meanwhile, some say that the minimum wage hikes will not result in a large decrease in employment. As the government decided to provide a subsidy worth 2.978.8 trillion won, the consumption limit of low-wage workers in November could increase due to an increase in the consumption of low-paid workers. Some also argued that even when corporations start to reduce their work force, their immediate reduction in employment will not be big if they consider the government's policy support.

"According to the government's forecast, multiple sellers are already required, but housing prices are still rising and buyers are more likely to be put on the market. Some analyze that multiple home owners are choosing to take a "" holding strategy "" instead of selling. According to the real estate industry on July 23, the agency for apartments in Gangnam, North Korea's main apartments in Seoul, has recently run out of seed. After two months of waiting in the wake of the August 2 real estate measures, the sale began in October, but has not been possible since then due to the lack of sales. Sometimes when something is sold, the demand for the item is tight and it seems to lead to transactions.Gangnam District has many residents who want to buy reconstruction apartments, such as Gaepo Jugong Apts. Songpa ward also has a steady stream of requests to purchase Jamsil, Jugong, Els, and Risenz, but it is not uncommon to sell them. Although prices have recently been hitting record highs, landlords are holding out on expectations that housing prices will rise further.Other than the three districts of Gangnam, the atmosphere is similar in Yangcheon-gu, Mapo-gu, Yongsan-gu, and Seongdong-gu. New town complexes in Mok-dong, Yangcheon-gu vary in size, but generally it is a valuable place to sell. As the demand is still strong, the sellers are continuing to dominate the market.Beginning April 1 next year, if multiple home owners (including union members) sign up for apartments in the areas they have to adjust, the capital gains tax will add 10 percent to those of two homes and 20 percent to those in three or more homes. A special long-term holding deduction is also excluded for two-household or more.The government has therefore advised multiple home owners to sell their homes before April next year, and it expects the supply to increase. However, the market is moving differently. Given the amount of time it takes to pay the deposit amount after signing the contract and before registering, it is now necessary to have multiple home sales. We don`t think it would make any big changes in the future if we don`t actually move our multiple home owners, an industry source said. ■ News 1 : The multiple designers ' choice to stay is explained by the expectation that prices will rise more than taxes. Even after the measures against the high intensity of 8-2, the apartments continued to appreciate in price and as the highest prices continued to rise. According to the National Day Apartment Price Trend (as of July 18) of the Korea Institute of Audit and Inspection, the price of apartments in Seoul has increased for the 14th straight week. For instance, the transfer profit margins of 300 million won are set to rise to around 60 million won at present, but the transfer tax will rise to about 130 million won in April next year, a dramatic increase in the rate of rent. In reality, 85 ㎡ housing units exclusively for Eunma apartments, which were traded at 1.2 billion won at the beginning of this year, are now trading at 1.6 billion won, up by 400 million won. In the current market, the sellers ` preference is sometimes concluded by handing over the transfer tax payment to the buyers, so the burden on the actual multiple homeowners is not too much. This could result in a higher house price and therefore only heavier burdens on buyers.We can not see that even in the Seoul sales market, where capital gains taxes are to be raised from January next year, owners are reportedly choosing to stay instead of sell, so we should wait and see how many homes are being sold.The Chicago Tribune in Chicago reported on July 22 (local time) that two residents in Chicago, Illinois, filed a class action suit against Apple in a local court yesterday. In addition to the two, one of the plaintiffs was from Ohio, Indiana and North Carolina.They said, "" My iPhone's performance decreased, so I bought a new one. He stressed that Apple did not disclose it intentionally to encourage the purchase of the new iPhone.California filed a lawsuit against Apple on the same day.Apple said in a statement released on July 20 that the reason why the speed of its older iPhone is slowed was due to measures taken to prevent the side effects of poor battery performance. Apple admitted to having intentionally slowed down the older iPhone.Apple explained that the lithium ion battery used in the iPhone could suddenly turn off to protect its parts if it is exposed to cold, under-charge or old. He added, "" After taking measures to block the iPhone 6, the iPhone 6Gb/s and the iPhone SE last year, the iPhone 7 has been expanded and will be expanded to other devices in the future. "" Reddit, a news community site in the United States, previously raised controversy over whether Apple intentionally slowed down the iPhone after using it a few years earlier.What you see next door is a free comic strip and a gift batter! ▶ As a writer of the massive cheer-leader versus racing girl, sseom raskol@mt.co.kr< and the "" Real Times with Money "" (major currency exchange), no one can make any change or redistribution-release (such as unauthorized currency). Access to the virtual currency exchange is being disrupted, making it impossible to buy or sell virtual currency at the time most want, such as at 5pm, rain or rise. Industry sources say the volume of transactions more than doubled compared to peacetime. The average daily deal on the local virtual currency market is about 7 trillion won.In case of an upbit, the company has switched into ‘ simplified mode ’ where it is difficult to check the user's market frequently, and kept the service intermittent while Bitshub was also suffering from a number of sales server failures. This is due to the surge in sales of all 30 major virtual currency groups. In particular, as the volume of sales remained flat for the ninth straight hour from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., some users said, "" The losses have snowballed due to a lack of access to the message board. "" It is the first time that the price of major virtual currencies, including Bitcone, dropped simultaneously. Bitcone, which was traded at 20 million won per unit until noon, has dropped to the 17 million won level in the last 15 days, and has since stayed in the same range of 18 million won since 5 p.m. The figure was a 16 percent drop from the previous day. In addition, the selling volume of major virtual currencies, including the Downloading and Light Coin, has steadily increased, falling by more than two digits from the previous day. The sudden drop in the price of virtual currency is analyzed as three reasons. First of all, the controversy over the bubble over major virtual currency widened when Charlie Lee sold all of the "" light coins "" that were believed to have been the founders of "" light coins "" that were based on market capitalization. Deemed that the virtual currency developer himself is in a bubble, and foreign news agencies such as Bloomberg say Yubbit, the Korea Virtual Monetary Exchange, went bankrupt due to hacking damage, deepening distrust in virtual currency transactions. That is why, after the U.S. stock market mountouts were hacked in the past, the price of Bitcone temporarily plummeted. In addition, the number of apartments to be sold for profit ahead of the holidays, including Christmas, has significantly increased. Due to the selling tax, the aggregate value of virtual currency in Korea decreased by more than several trillion won. As virtual currencies including Bitchine plummeted, more than 100 trillion won of the total market has evaporated. However, even in such a large market slump, the more expensive kimchi premium is maintained in the Korean market. Bitcone is currently trading at around 14 million won per dollar in Bitrex in the U.S., but is trading at 18 million won in Korea and selling for nearly 30 percent of the bill is expensive.

"The six-story building was damaged by changing from poorly insulated stream building to pre-regulated building, and related building regulations. The fire was almost tinder in the building. The administrative agency did not properly supervise. Although the governments cry out for a "" safety Korea, "" the scene of the tragedy again proved to be a sham. The commercial complex in Jecheon, where a fire broke out, is located in an area designated under the Building Act. Installation of fire resistant materials on exterior walls shall be mandatory, along with installation of fire resistant glass and windows. Building exterior wall finishing materials with six stories or higher or 22 meters in height, as well as those intended for sports and entertainment facilities, shall be used with non-burning materials. However, the shopping mall avoided the law by submitting an application for building permit five months before the regulations were enforced (December 2010). [Graphic : Park Kyung-min and Cha Joon-hong, reporter of the building minn@joongang.co.kr] The exterior walls are equipped with a ' dry bit ' method. When finishing construction on an outer wall of a building, this technique covers mortar (cement, etc.) on insulation and closes the exterior. In Korea, a company first introduced the technique in 1987 in collaboration with a U.S. company called Dreilbit. Since then, the company's name ' dry bit ' has been used like a common noun. The problem with the dry bit technique in Korea is the use of many petroleum products, including foam polystyrene, as insulation. The stores that were on fire also used styrofoam. In the United States, more than 70 percent of heat-insulated insulation is made up of internal-combustion insulation, mostly organic insulation is cheap at one-third the price, an official at an insulation company said. Fire prevention department professor at Kyungil University in Seoul said, Most buildings are built with insulation such as the Stirons in Korea, but we also need to tighten regulations to change even those built before the law takes effect into internal combustion products. We understand the problem, but it`s a shame that the government can not afford to renovate all of the existing buildings, said an official at the ministry. Some say that the safety regulations should be tightened to prevent buildings with five or lower levels from using flammable insulation. "" Almost all of the insulation for buildings on the fifth floor and below is foam. For safety reasons, it is right to require that even buildings with less than five floors use non-smoking materials. The backwardness of the first-story building is also on the table. Fire department officials said that while they were installing a heated pipe on the roof of a parking lot on the first floor, the flames were transferred to an 11-mm foam installed for moisture proof. As a result, the burning foam came down to the car in the parking lot below, spreading the flames. However, they did not take any safety measures during the operation. The fire spread quickly to the ninth floor using a flame-proof external building dry-bit, a flammable exterior material, and a 15 car and an external car inside the parking lot. Authorities confirmed the situation via CCTV. Residents claimed that the ceiling material, which was originally aluminum, has been replaced by plastic materials during the recent renovations, as to why flames and toxic gasses spread rapidly upstairs in the parking lot on the first floor. There are also some aspects to the remodeling process of this building. The building was approved for use on August 9, 2010. The building, which was originally a seven-story building, was expanded to 8th and ninth floors respectively after having been extended two times in 2012 and 2013. The building was closed for several months before reopening last October. Jeong Sang-man, a professor at the Ministry of Construction and Environment at Kongju University, said, Safety should be the top priority of national policies, actively investing, and spreading the safety into the culture of the public.

I expect to make preparations during the Christmas holidays and submit them on Tuesday (July 26), Yoo told The First Department of News. Another opponent said, We have formed a consensus to file an application for provisional disposition before the voting took place. As voting for all party members is carried out in order of K-Botting on July 27-28 (the online voting system for the Central Election Commission), ARS votes on July 29-30, and announcement of results on July 31, it is a strategy to block the vote by arbitration.

Starting in 2011, the Ministry of Public Administration and Security will provide a subsidy of 70 million won per year. Currently, more than 460,000 elementary schools nationwide are members of the group, which is initially meant to ' protect the safety of my children's way home from school ' and ' honor the wishes of my volunteers '. However, with the rise of working couples and more parents unwilling to participate, most elementary schools have turned it into "" compulsory participation. "" Each school is different, but each parents should take turns doing their duty two to three times a year. Parents can not help but feel burdened because they have to go out even if they have to work or do something urgent at home. Instead, they are seeking part-time workers to do volunteer work. More than 10 companies are involved. I usually get about 25,000 to 35,000 won per hour.The membership fee for green mothers is also sometimes controversial. Most public schools do not have a fee, but some private schools charge 20,000-30,000 won for running the Green Mothers ' Association. She usually buys green mother's uniform and flags and collects the money. Other schools may ask parents to "" buy and wear green mother's clothes "" each year. Yoo Hye-jin (39), a first grade elementary school student living in Seocho-dong, Seoul, directly ordered clothes from her mother's green mother's group last summer and went on a traffic map. She said she spent about 50,000 won on a blue long shirt with a tie, a hat, and an apron. Yoo said, "" I bought clothes quietly so I wouldn't want to be told I was a disgruntled mother, so I dressed up in silence and went on duty early in the morning, but I honestly felt I had to pay a few things I couldn't wear to serve. ""Recently, fathers at many elementary schools have taken charge of green mothers instead of mothers. But many schools still fail to say, ' Mom should do it, ' as a representative of Green Mother's School and Class. Kim Ho-in (44), a lawyer and a second-grade son in elementary school, once said, "" As a father, I wanted to participate actively in school activities, so I asked if I could represent my green mother. I think it is right to change my name to Green School Mothers, too. Lee Soo-yeon, director of the Korea Working Mom Institute, said, I regret the prejudice that volunteering at a children's school is just for mothers.Kang Yoon-rye, head of the Green Mother`s Association, said, Until now, it is not possible for the association to know about autonomous walking fees at each school, and fathers who want to serve as non-members would have to participate.Song Hye-jin, a reporter at Dongsan.com, a Chosun Ilbo, Chosun Ilbo, Chosun.com, No unauthorized copying and redistribution, bereaved families of fire fighters, and fire department.The fire department says it was inevitable and powerless, but it appears to convince the bereaved families of the tragedy that killed 29. This is the case when re-configuration of fires and the initial conditions of the Jecheon fire station is carried out by the hour. Jecheon Fire Station, which accepted the situation at 3:53 p.m. on July 21, arrived at the scene at 4:00 p.m. and took three smoke eaters to the hospital. Three helicopters were dispatched at 4:30 p.m. to the Central 119 district, and at 4:37 a.m., Jecheon Fire Station carried one more person to the hospital. Four minutes later, at 4:41, he jumped off the third floor onto a mattress installed by Jecheon Fire Station. Against this backdrop, firefighters were called only by flat smoke for an hour to rescue only four heubipjja. At 5:17 a.m., the first time a dead person was found on the second floor, 29 people were confirmed dead in the building by jet lag.Bereaved families at the Jecheon fire scene raised their voices, saying, "" If the fire department started an aggressive rescue, such as breaking the open sauna on the second floor, which had many victims, they could save more people. "" Bereaved families of the 22, Moon Jae-in who visit the hospital where the young body president against Minister for the Ministry of Administration and Security gimbugyeom and tongue lashing out. One family member said, "" If only the women had broken the sauna on the second floor, I would have almost lived. "" "" Even if you had broken the window at 4:07 p.m., you would have broken your mother-in-law's eyes. "" `` The firefighters were making a fuss over just a radio and then scurrying around with only one car moving, '' he said. `` The fire, which was so damaging, was obviously a disaster due to not following the fire manual. '' Another family member explained thoroughly about the delay, saying, The first time the fire started at 3:53 p.m. yesterday, it was after 5:00 p.m. when the fire department called on us.The bellowing fire department of the victim's family explained to the bereaved family, "" We didn't have enough time to deal with the situation. "" We don`t intend to delay breaking the windows, the fire chief told a news conference in North Chungcheong Province. The fire chief explained the gas explosion, explaining to a nearby CCTV at 3:54 p.m., with flames falling from the parking lot on the first floor of Sports Town, and quickly released it. We could not get near the rail guard due to the illegal parking vehicles around the building, he added. After moving into the parking lot of 15 vehicles, the flames were intense, Lee said, emphasizing their fire evolution to prevent the explosion of nearby LPG tanks. Some fire department officials also said they had to be careful when breaking windows. They say that when oxygen is suddenly introduced into the building, it can cause the flames to spread or explode, thus creating a backlash.The conflicting arguments of the fire department at the press conference result in illegal parking to stop fire trucks from entering the area due to the bigger accident, shutting down the entrance gates of the sauna on the second floor, and conducting a dry run with fire sprinklers (the first floor). After receiving a protest from the bereaved family, Minister Kim Bu-kyum heard that the group was in an early stage of confusion. We will investigate what we have to investigate as soon as possible, and we will investigate what we have to investigate, a government official said. bwy@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"[Graphic] U.N. Security Council approaching the threshold of sanctions on North Korea on its new North Korea council…'Engage fund prevention measures by overseas workers (excluding oil sanctions by Kim Jong-un and Kim Yeo-jung) It did not put its name on the blacklist (sanctions list), but it is intended to undermine the will to develop nuclear weapons by pressuring North Korean Workers ' Party Chairman Kim Jong-un in all directions. In particular, the supply of refinery products, including gasoline, diesel, and kerosene, was drastically reduced to 500,000 barrels per year. Two sanctions have cut it to the same level as the previous 10 percent : "" It's only crude oil left. "" At the same time, it is also interpreted as meaning to boost the possibility of the pipeline shutting and bring North Korea to the table. ◇ Open Oil Buildings…If the Oil Pipeline Shut-Prevention Security Council set out to impose oil sanctions under its "" 2375 "" resolution adopted on September 11, it increased its intensity this time. The sanctions on crude oil, considered the North Korean regime's lifeline, have not been more specific this time. It appears to have acted out of awareness of the backlash from China, the North's biggest supporter of nuclear weapons and an oil supply line. The estimated 4 million barrels of crude oil a year have been frozen at the current level. Although the maximum annual cap of 4 million barrels is specified, the effectiveness of this may cause a discrepancy in the assessment. The oil supply volume has not been officially confirmed. The resolution, which reduces the annual supply of refinery products from 4.5 million barrels to 2 million barrels per year, will further reduce the supply to 500,000 barrels. The resolution was cut off nearly 90 percent from 4.5 million to 500,000 barrels, two times. Most notably, it is noteworthy to specify measures to strengthen fuel sanctions against additional nuclear tests or intercontinental ballistic missiles. The existing resolution also warned of serious provocations. It can be seen as a ' trigger-trigger ' provision that would automatically invoke additional oil sanctions on additional provocations. In fact, they warned that they could eliminate any supply of refinery products that had been reduced to the "" bottom right "" or block crude oil. Basically, the Security Council resolution is made through negotiation with the United States and China. Therefore, if North Korea makes further provocations with nuclear and ICBMs, the fuel restriction will automatically reach the negotiation table.North Korea's ICT-level projected long-range ballistic missile launch (PG) [manufacture Lee Tae-ho, Choi Ja-yoon] photo composition, illustration, and a halt to the dollar payment of an ex-direction dollar ... 'The U.N. Security Council has decided to impose sanctions on North Korea 2397 [Lee Tae-ho, Choi Ja-yoon], a photo synthesis, and an illustration that shows Kim Jong Un's key source of foreign currency within two years of repatriation of the U.S. dollar. Existing workers could work until the contract expired, although existing resolutions prohibited the extension of new employment and contracts. Therefore, the resolution is estimated to have brought North Korean workers to an end of 2019. The final amendment, which was initially negotiated with the United States and China (blue text · blue text), was initially ' within 12 months ' but was later known to have been delayed to ' within 24 months of voting ' as Russia complained. There are no exact statistics, but North Korea is estimated to send up to 100,000 people to 40 countries to earn dollars. If all of the workers are returned to Korea, their foreign currency imports will decrease from $ 200 million to $ 500 million. The expansion of the prohibited export items of North Korea into food, agricultural products, machinery, electronic equipment, minerals, mud, timber, lumber and ships can also be regarded as a "" cash-shielding "" act. A U.N. official said, We have already blocked the export of foreign currency sources, including possible ones. As a result of the expansion of the export ban, it is estimated that North Korea`s export earnings will be decreased by about $ 250 million. Legalizes the East Sea fishing and the Yellow Sea, we were trading ban is also construed as set out more clearly about the 'marine products embargo.'.The blacklist is currently subject to 63 individual and 53 group members. In addition, 16 individuals and one group will be added. Fourteen North Korean banks are represented abroad, and the other two are the two leading figures in the missile development department - First Deputy Director of the Workers ` Party's Logistics and Trade Ministry and Vice Minister Kim Jung-sik. Once blacklisted, travelers are banned and assets are frozen. As a group, the People's Resistance Department was blacklisted. The chairman of the ruling Workers ` Party, Kim Jong-un, and his younger sister, Kim Yeo-jung, were not added to the blacklist. If Kim Jong-un is blacklisted, it could mean completely denying the regime itself. Therefore, it is entirely possible to say that it is an analysis that the U.S. left it as a card for sanctions in the future, and that it is a step that will allow for dialogue with North Korea. jun@yna.co.kr and inquiry (Click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (Click!) ■ News 1 : Lee Eun-ju, designers ' protest against the North Korean move, and "" The two Koreas ' training will not be delayed "" (U.S. President George W. Bush's statement) Amid high expectations for a change in the situation following the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February next year, North Korea's response is expected to determine the direction of the Korean Peninsula. North Korea is likely to protest in any way since it has resisted whenever the U.N. Security Council has adopted a resolution on sanctions against the North. When the Security Council adopted the resolution to impose sanctions on North Korea, which bans all shipments of coal to the North in August, it flatly denounced the resolution in a statement by the government, the highest authority in a day. It further raised tension on the Korean Peninsula by issuing warning shots surrounding Guam, the U.S. military headquarters, suggesting a full-scale war. In some cases, U.N. sanctions immediately lead to armed protests. North Korea launched a North Pacific ballistic missile (IRBM) three days later into the air when it received Type 2375, which banned imports of North Korean textiles and limited fuel supply to the North. In particular, the new resolution, No.2399, on sanctions against North Korea is also highly subject to sanctions, so it can not be ruled out what could lead to an armed protest. The No. 2397 plant cut off 90 percent of its annual supply of refinery products such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene in North Korea. It also stated that workers dispatched to other countries for the return of money should be sent back within 24 months.If the North faces with an armed provocation, not only will the neighboring countries ' expectations and efforts to turn the situation into a cold one, but the government's ' bid to stage a peace Olympics ' by inviting the North to the Games. In particular, if the North makes an armed provocation with the South Korean proposal to delay its military drills during the Pyeongchang Games, the postponement of the drill will be futile and the weight will appear to be on the military option again in the United States. Unification Minister Cho Myung-kyoon also said in a special lecture on the standing committee of the United Liberal Democrats on July 20, It depends on the attitude of North Korea to delay training, and if North Korea and the United States can show no inclination toward missile tests or provocations. However, it is expected that it will not lead to a provocation strong enough to upset the specifications of North Korea's protest. North Korea, which recently hurriedly declared its intention to complete its nuclear weapons program, is also in urgent need of a shift to negotiation due to fatigue and pressure over the sanctions. Cho Han-beom, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, said, The intensive attacks, such as intercontinental ballistic missiles, do not give the international community the justification for the last remaining oil supply limit or military option, but strongly opposed the statement."
"The National Police Agency and the National Institute of Scientific Investigation will look over the broken glass windows of the complex sports center building in Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province on July 22. 20 out of 29 women were found dead in the bath on the second floor.Police are investigating the cause of the tragedy at Jecheon Sports Center in North Chungcheong Province on July 21.Police analyzed video footage of CC, a closed circuit, on July 22 and identified the ignition point as being on the first floor. The possibility of a misfiring by ‘ carelessness ’ is being raised first, as the ceiling construction was in progress at the time.Police estimated that the fire started around 3:53 p.m. during the installation of heated pipes at parking lots on the first floor of the building. The flames seem to have spread quickly when a flame-mounted styrofoam fell into the car. Fire authorities analyzed that the fire spread to the rooftop of the building in a flash, burning 16 cars at the parking lot and riding a dry bit (one of the combustible insulation) on the exterior. We are open to all possibilities, including a short circuit to ground, a short circuit to electricity, and carelessness in construction, police officials said.One resident said, The fire caused a commotion when the water on the second floor failed to suddenly come out and construction was underway on the first floor ceiling when we went out after taking a bath. We saw some sort of welding, I understand you have been plumbing for a long time.The fire started on the first floor and was fiercely carried upstairs on the exterior walls. The exterior walls were made of flammable, flammable adhesive, and air flowed in easily between the walls and the exterior materials, creating a "" chimney effect. "" The outer walls are fire-proof with a cement "" dry bit "" applied to the foam.Witnesses said in unison, A pop was heard on the first floor, followed by a blaze of flames that spread to the second floor, then immediately climbed over the exterior walls. Flames and smoke spread to the upper levels in a flash, through a central entrance to the second floor.Most of the passengers in the building could not get out when they heard the alarm bell that said "" Fire "". The sprinklers didn't work either. In the event of a fire, the sprinkler would lower the pressure on the alarm valve and open the piping, but the alarm valve was locked and went down the drain.It was confirmed that the building received fire inspections by private organizations late last month pointing to leakage of sprinkler heads and branch joint on the first floor, open and malfunction of the heat detectors and smoke detectors, and defective fire extinguishers. When the inspection results were submitted to the fire department, the fire department ordered the building owners to take corrective measures, but the inspection results were not submitted to the fire station before the fire broke out.Jecheon Fire Station Chief Lee Sang-min said, "" Because vehicles parked on either side of the road were so difficult to enter, I called a breakdown truck to clean my car, "" and added, "" I failed to get my car done with a fast ladder. "" It was an urgent moment when they needed to break windows to rescue residents, but the fire was so intense that they could not access it.However, some point out that the fire department made a mistake in the initial response. Kim (42), who lost her daughter to a fire, said, "" If I had called my daughter to say she was upstairs on the phone and told me to break the glass upstairs, the firemen would have been wrong for some reason. "" The rescue seekers fell down one by one, while they breathed black smoke. By the time when the first floor was set to catch some fire at 4:30 p.m., he was already late to enter the building by crossing the ladder and breaking the windows of the second floor. The death toll increased rapidly to 29 as one was announced as of 5 p.m.The most damaging area was the women's bath on the second floor. A total of 20 bodies were found on the second floor, including 11 others found in front of the sliding doors of the bath. The sliding door was damaged. There are many witnesses that the door did not work properly. One resident recalled, "" When I came to the bath house on July 10, the door button on Yeotang was not working, so the desk's men came up and opened it. ""The structure of the bath house, which looks like a maze, also caused damages. Choi (64), who witnessed the scene, said, I felt uneasy about the men who were exercising, and escaped right away because they were dressed, but the women who were in the bath room did not show up.The deaths also occurred in the upper floors, including two fitness centers on the sixth floor, two steps between the sixth and seventh floors, four fitness centers on the seventh floor, and an eight-story restaurant."" I still can't believe it. "" Let's go home now that I'm wrong.

The first among 29 deaths from the fire at the First funeral hall in Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province, on July 23, 2001, was followed by a lightly foggy ceremony. Kim In-dong, who had left his Tutor wife Chang Kyung-ja (64) after the accident, held the coffin and wept at the funeral. About 50 bereaved family members and relatives who were tragically widowed also shed tears at the crying of their widowed husband. The couple visited the gym that caught fire in order to exercise their muscle in the afternoon of July 21 when the fire broke out. While exercising together for about an hour, Kim ran out when she learned that the building was on fire. Kim saw his wife leading the way and thought she escaped safely. When he saw women running out of the bath on the second floor while he was being evacuated, he helped rescue others and left the building.Cho Hyun-hom, an intern at the Jeongsan Sports Center in North Chungcheong Province, said, "" White chrysanthemums are covered with wounds. However, the face of his wife, whom he thought had been evacuated from the building, was not seen. I called in a hurry. "" Glass doesn't break with a hammer, "" she exclaimed hastily. This was the last call with my wife. When spring comes, we started working out together earlier this month to enjoy mountain climbing with our wives, Kim said, crying as he still can not believe that we went earlier. Kim, who held the ceremony, will stay at his home in Mojeong-ri, Baegun-myeon, Jecheon-si, Seoul, and go on a tour with his wife. Afterwards, he plans to bury his wife in a charnel house by cremation.

"" In the United States, consumers decided to sue the collective. South Korean regulators have not yet stated their intention to intervene. Other smartphones, including Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, are showing growing interest in doing so, but the companies say they do not care. This is Sunhee Park, channel A news. Samsung Corp. shares fell sharply in the previous week amid concerns over massive block sales of 497.3 billion won. According to the financial investment industry on July 23, the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) decided to change its guidelines to prohibit new investment in mergers and acquisitions announced in December 2015 after two general meetings. The Fair Trade Commission asked Samsung SDI to sell 5 million shares in Samsung Corp., which owned both companies ' shares when Samsung Corp. and Jeil Industries merged, to prevent the company from strengthening its circular investment structure. However, the main part of the interpretation is that the decision made by the Fair Trade Commission at the time was flawed. As the circular investment ring was formed, not strengthened, by the merger, Samsung SDI should sell all 90.4 million Samsung Securities shares held by the merger. Samsung SDI sold 5 million shares at the time, but it also has to sell the remaining 4,040,000 shares according to the new interpretation. Samsung Corp. fell 5.75 percent during the week amid concerns that a large volume of sales would hit the market. It has been falling for the last seven weeks in a row. Samsung Electronics ` (- 3.42 %) controlling structure, Samsung's - 4.61 %, and Samsung SDI's (- 4.27 %) overall market were affected by the announcement on July 21. However, stock market experts say such shocks won't last long. Lee Sang-hun, an economist at High-Investment Investment and Securities Co., stressed, It is only a short-term supply and demand issue. The least impact was that Samsung would give most of its products to favorable investors who see the company`s future as positive, or explain to Samsung Group Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong. "" If 4 million shares are released to the market in the form of overtime block, the discount rate will not allow us to lower the share price, but if we do, it won't improve in the long run, "" he said. Kim Dong-yang, economist at NH Investment & Securities also said, The stock price is not going to fall much or dominate due to Samsung Corp.`s additional weakness in its shares, adding that Samsung SDI has already 30 percent. If Samsung succeeds in handing over to groups or favorable investors, it can act as a driving force for the stock price rise, said Baekgwang Securities ` researcher, explaining that the current stock price is too low a performance or asset value. ▶ id@yna.co.kr driver information and contact (Click!) hip area, all trends (Click!) 親洪 local elections … right into my camp of political parties and competition 'attention' [ cbs baksseongwan No Cut News.Press freedom ] Korea Party ‘very much a list of Sung’ leader Hong Joon-pyo, the Supreme Court's headquarters in Youido, Seoul on July 22 that will be acquitted with a beaming countenance a news conference.After walking out of it.

Hong was indicted without physical detention on charges of receiving 100 million won from a close aide to the former chairman of the Kyungnam-do conglomerate, Sung Wan-jong, before the GNP primary in June 2011.The Supreme Court decision remained for Hong, as it has always been an Achilles ' heel. From the time of the presidential election until the ruling on the same day, he was constantly tagged as a possible guilty representative of the Korea Party. This has been a burden not only on himself but also the entire party. The party was worried about what would happen to our party if it was dismissed for guilty reasons.Hong, who was always confident of his innocence amid such anxiety, stayed with some of his close associates in the voting booth at Yeouido, Seoul until the day of the judgment.

On July 12, when Seo Jae-hoon was suffering from a cold of - 12 degree, a house in Sinwol-dong, Yangcheon-gu, Seoul, was opened to live alone as a kitchen visitor for 14 years. Remove oyster salad, squid, and kimchi from the refrigerator, put them on a small dish, and open the rice cooker to take out the rice you made the previous day. Side dishes are served at the Women's Development Center in Seoul's Seobu City, where about 20 dock men gather once a month to learn how to cook, but meals made from the ' Home Food Alone program ' are now available. The days of serving a cup of soju and a cup of coffee are much smaller than before.Kang says, ' I do not mean one of the 4,400 people who support the Nabinam Project, ' which is not part of the isolated community in Yangcheon-gu, Seoul, to help prevent dog owners in their 50s from becoming isolated. If it was unfortunate, Kang, who had run a box manufacturing plant down the drain, began to fall apart when creditors went bankrupt. The solvers came every day, threatening wives and two sons. After divorcing his decision, "" Let's send the babies and the wives and suffer alone, "" he went from day to day. I've barely managed to make a living for three or four years. He had a terrible accident. Cars were sliding on Olympic roads in the middle of winter when daily workers were riding on a bong-go-car. Kang's car, which was the target vehicle, killed the passenger in the other car. Kang also lost one finger and broke all his teeth. After being hospitalized for six months, the world was dark. I didn't think it could be darker, but surprisingly, there was more darkness. Still, creditors are chasing him, and with his disability, he can no longer work as a day laborer. He went out of the house only at night and at dawn when no one was moving around. There was nothing to do but deliver newspapers and milk. In broad daylight, he hid himself indoors and fought the sun. Life in captivity, never to be seen by anyone. So nine years passed. A few misfortunes was enough for life to fall to the abyss. A table set by Kang Myung-jin, a single mother in her 50s. Now, she eats one meal a day at home. "" Why didn't you want to die? And you're like, "" Well, I don't know where your family lives. "" And I said to myself, "" If I stayed home by myself during the day, I couldn't stop and talk to my husband and I couldn't have a single cup of soju. The district office conducted an investigation to find the target audience for Nabinam Project, which was launched as a major project this year. After a second in-depth examination by a welfare planner and visiting nurse, Kang is once again a Nabinam, supported by various policies of Yangcheon-gu to help him go out into the world and support himself. Park Seon-jong, head of the welfare council, who has a mentee relationship with her husband, is meeting with the head of the New York Welfare Council once a week to get mentoring from them, and counseling legal procedures for recovering bad credit standing. I also go to a cooking class once a month. "" Now I'm going to go out and live. I feel a little confident and move around a lot. We can go to the dong office, go to the health center, go to the gym, go to the mentor's office, and have a meal together. "" At the foot of Kang's bed is a big teddy bear. It is a doll where someone takes what they threw out on the street and takes it to wash it clean and stay with them. The family is so supportive that they can say, "" I went to the district office today, Gomdol. "" Words like "" solitary "" are no longer in his vocabulary.Why are you a single boy in his fifties?The object of self-reliance that comes to mind when it comes to solitude is the elderly. But the statistics reveal a completely different reality. The highest rate of loneliness is in the age of 50, with the proportion of males overwhelmingly higher. Men aged 50 to 64 years who are considered capable by the country to work should be placed in welfare blind spots when they become vulnerable. You have to wait until you are 65 to get a basic pension for the elderly. In the meantime, the history of solitude often attacks the victims, but the tragedy of a man in his fifties is not socially visible. The history of solitude is currently devoid of exact academic and legal concepts. No exact statistics are therefore produced. The only data cited in statistics on solitude are those written by KBS Panorama Team, which aired the show ' Korean History of Solitude ' in 2014. The report analyzes the police ' field trips to the speaker in 2013 and local governments ' reports on the treatment of non-highlife victims, which analyzed and arranged 32 to 8 cases involving lonely deaths. According to the data, the highest incidence of solitude occurred in the age of 50 to 29 percent. After that, 17.9 percent of those in their 60s, 17 percent in their 40s and 9.1 percent in their 70s followed. By region, the incidence of solitary accidents was high in large cities. Seoul had the most solitude with 25.45 percent, while the economy followed with 20.26 percent. Men are the most dominant sex. According to a study by the Seoul Welfare Foundation based on KBS data, the incidence of sexual solitude accounted for nearly 13 percent of the total number of female deaths last year, whereas that of males was 85 percent.A solitary death is a death that is discovered (usually three days later) after the death of a single person who lived alone through the last phase of his death, with little or no communication between family, neighbors or friends. In Seoul, there are a clear case of solitude of 162, which occurs every other day, and the number of suspected cases is 2,181 every year, which is 6 cases per day. Among the cases, 137 males and 21 females are confirmed.The first such discovery was made by a man in his fifties who was at risk of being killed in solitude. Living alone at an age just before being incorporated into the social welfare system, it is a group with chronic disease, day or night jobs, divorce, unemployment, and other illnesses cut off from its social connections. "" Women have a strong survival instinct and they are more likely to live independently. But men at this age are proud and closed. It's a time of life when we have to go through business failures or divorces, and welfare policies say, "" You know, you know, you know, it's time for you to be in your 50s, you know, to be alone, to drink a lot. The doll's teddy bear and Nabinam Kang Myung-jin, the name tag they wore at the time of making their movie on Nabi Namyeong, a topic of safety, are on the dressing table. The Yangcheon-gu Nabinam project, which aims to help the dog-nakers in their 50s to support themselves with side dishes and cooking lessons, began in February this year with a full investigation into Dokgeonam. Among the 6,841 men aged between 50 and 64 who were identified as one resident and who were surveyed, 393 dock men who need real assistance were ' extradited ' and 11 homeless men who were registered as residents The excavation process was not easy, either. Many men would not open the door for help even if they died of pride. The group most at risk of going to solitary death. Yangcheon-gu completed an investigation to 80 percent by persuading dock men still refusing to investigate, and the fire department and police department also agreed to allow the tracking of problems and the signing of forced doors.The Nabinam Project is a two-stage relationship between the two and four-stage butterfly owners discovered through a previous and present study, titled ' Meeting the World, ' and is in the process of finding the third stage of their hope. The second stage involves restoring social networks to allow 95 community volunteers to form mentors and develop one-on-one relationships with butterfly males so that they can get out of the world slowly. "" Never drink together, be sympathetic, and don't be hasty. Wait until you come to it. "" mentor owners meet up with three principles of working together and running a mentor group once a week. The most important three-stage solution consisted of 52 projects by private and public unions. Yangcheon-gu Office 17 Gaedong conducts a total of 33 Nabinam support projects depending on its characteristics, and has the largest number of Sarangchae support programs. There is even a replacement project such as providing a haircut bath coupon, dental examination and treatment fee, medical checkup, daily necessities purchase coupon, and LED cooking practice. Fluorescent lights are projects to replace LED lights with self-induced, self-induced lighting. It is vital because of the nature of the dock men that there are many semi-basement dwellings. Starting July, Hanbit Welfare Center has a private space for welfare, health, employment, and financial counseling services for the elderly. The goal of the project is to help the residents return to the community and become helpful mentors in the recipients.Last month, Twitter harshly criticized some women for providing welfare benefits to men in their 50s who want to hide their tracks and pay attention. Critics say the nation is keeping the patriarchal privileges of men who have never been equipped with basic living skills in the form of welfare policies. In reality, ' Hoenbap ' and ' discussion meeting ' is the most important aspect of fostering self-support among the 52 support projects."
"Wow, the restaurant has only two easy meals, while it has fourteen side dishes and lunch services. Sarangchan's business is a service that allows butterfly lovers to pick up side dishes from three to four grocery stores, and it provides service only to those who lack mobility and are not comfortable with their own limits. The lunch is part of a program that was hosted by the Yangcheon`s Eye Consumer Life Cooperative Federation every May for the underprivileged, including the basic life tenant, single parent family members, seniors over the age of 65 and the disabled. An official from Yangcheon-gu said, "" Women often lived with their children, support their children through the support business of single parent or a mother's family, and the results of the solo sports business were different this year, since it was only natural for men to support their children "" Middle-aged women who raise children do not actively tap the doors of government offices and obtain various welfare information through intimate social networks, while middle-aged single men do not go out to hiding. In terms of jobs, women in their 50s can work in various service positions, even though they are underpaid. It is an architecture that can easily be degraded by surplus of society. Chung Chang-young, head of the Home Affairs Bureau in Yangcheon-gu, said, As people in their 50s are in blind spots, it is often difficult to help them because they do not have legal regulations, especially since they are in the middle of a blind spot. It is impossible to learn self-sustained skills without a will to support oneself. Self-support can not be sought without an immediate solution to existence. Butterfly boys have lived alone for many years, so they often have rudimentary housing skills. Local governments are offering healthier food and health care opportunities to support themselves. It is a duty of course for the nation to step up to the rescue of the people exposed to danger. The Yangcheon-gu Office Plan next year also reported research and support for a woman in her 50s."" Today, when community culture is lost and societies become societies of different students, the solitude scene is not just an individual problem but a problem of the general public's interest and of everyone else's interest, "" said Kim Soo-young, head of Yangcheon-gu Office.

The union will discuss three ways to finalize the negotiation by the end of the year next week, to keep the strike open, and to resume negotiations next February after the parliamentary elections next January. A union official said yesterday, We will choose one of the three depending on the company's attitude and the opinions of the public on the site. Among the three measures, it is predicted that it will be physically difficult to complete the negotiation by the end of the year. Even if negotiations resume next week, the company can not tell whether it will propose a plan to raise the wage, and since it will mark the anniversary of the company's founding on July 29, there will not be many opportunities left. In addition, some analysts say it is highly likely that the internal and external criticism that the only way to continue the strike is to fight unconditionally without reneging. Though the option to resume negotiation in February is the most likely option, the unions should worry about the dissatisfaction of the members of the negotiation team, who have been delaying it. Now the ball is back to the company, said a union official, As the union members judged the members lack and decided, there are not many options to choose from. The union voted for the tentative agreement on temporary voting by 58,890 union members on July 22, and found that 45.28 percent (88.44 percent) voted in favor of the agreement, and that 22,501 (88.24 percent) voted against it. Labor unions attributed the rejection to a lower-than-ever wage increase. Labor and management reached a tentative agreement in the 39th round of negotiations held at the Ulsan factory on July 19. The tentative agreement includes a wage hike of 58,000 won, a 300 percent plus 2.8 million won payment in compensation, and 200,000 points in support of small companies ` products. young@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"[Hangers]Lepochindong's Christmas with my mom. I still remember being swept away by the crowd, or my mom's hand, whom I held tightly to keep me sweating, and what kind of gift I was going to get. But the view of the street that I found after 20 years was very different. Christmas trees, sparkling decorations, and exciting carols remain the same, but merchants ’ eyes are filled with loss as they gaze on the quiet streets. In 2017, the cold winds at the bottom of the Sewol create loneliness."" It's rather a good business to close down and go home to sleep soon. "" Changshin-dong, Seoul, once packed with customers twice a day, was hard to find when it was just 20 days before Christmas. Park Jong-sik, reporter of Tongsik Media anaki@hani.co.kr moved into the 300m street and moved into the bus and train station of Dongjae-dong Wholesale Market and Seoul Station. Now I have to sell numbers to customers and sell them. Han, who met with The Hankyoreh on July 17, said he sold only about four or five 10,000-won tops for six hours starting at 9 a.m. When I first started working in Changshin-dong, stores were crowded to the point that I had to give my customers a number to get a business. I doubt it will happen again. "" The day's sales at Han`s store were only around 100,000 won. Han complained that "" crayons or colored pencils were popular as a Christmas gift, but no one has been looking for a phrase since they were sold 10 days ago. "" The stationery streets outside the store were almost deserted. The Christmas stationery was in preparation for the rush. Red Santa Claus doll and green Christmas tree were displayed in rows of stores more than 300 meters away, and gold and silver tree decorations were shining along the walls of the store. However, it was hard to find anyone who came to buy a phrase that was not well decorated. As the neighborhood stationery stores have declined, so have the number of people who visit wholesale markets such as stationery. Wholesale marketeers on stationery manage to make ends meet by selling "" Cheonso So-saI. "" Cheonsoma means 1,000 won toys, such as ' Slimes ' and ' Liquid Monster. ' Online retailers and large retailers, who are strong players in the stationery market, do not deal in selling chilblains with cheap prices and low profits. Chang Pil-sik, 42, who runs a grocery store on stationery street, said, "" It is so hard to keep a store in the store that even the old stationery store selling Cheonso packages is barely surviving. "" These days, it is bad to keep the store open. We only use gas charges to turn on the stove, said the self-motivated remark, It is better to close the doors quickly and go home to sleep. Oh Se-in (64), who has been running the stationery store Ye-ji-sa for the past 33 years, also said, If it was like the past, it would have been so crowded with customers who wanted to buy Christmas gifts that the streets were completely dead. At the end of the year, Changsin-dong's stationery was about to celebrate a lonely Christmas. Changsin-dong Nongsa Alley is one of the most popular wholesale markets for stationery and toys formed in an alley that runs 300m from Dongdaemun Station to Dongmyo Station. Barriers in front of the station began to close when the bus terminal and Dongdaemun train station left for Gangnam and Cheongnyang-ri in 1968. A stationery supply of wholesale accounts began to enter the scene. In those days, mostly mufflemen sold things on buses. We mainly used stationery, such as ballpoint pens and notebooks, but with good transportation in the Dongdaemun area, wholesalers built their nests to provide goods to merchants, explained the official. In the 1980s, the number of stationery and toys shops increased to about 100. Currently, about 110 stationery and toy stores are open for business. Merchants said in unison that the 1990s was the ' heyday ' of the stationery. During the bridge, owners of the state-of-stock store flocked to the street. It is said that once in the morning after the school hours, and twice a day on the evening when the business was over. Jo ChI-yeol (44), who runs the Kyung-in Kyoung passage, recalled the alley that was filled with serious trucks every morning. A serious injury is someone who delivers wholesale goods with orders from a local stationery store, short for "" middle aged. "" When we opened our first store in 2002, we sold our business well enough to break down branches, he said. Back then, people from November were busy buying Christmas gifts. Lee Young-jun (55), head of SinjI Market, said, Only 10 years ago, a merchant association showed up at the end of Christmas and warned against losing a baby.Changsin-dong Mujingjigae Street is one of the most popular shopping malls and phrases formed by an alley in front of Dongmyo, 300m from Dongdaemun Station to Dongmyo. Park Jong-sik, a journalist and writer of the newspaper, could not find the same vigor as before, when he visited the streets of the crisis along with the decline in the journalism business. Since the 2000s, the literary circle has declined and Changshin-dong has been unable to avoid its effects. Merchants have tried to endure by doing anything by reducing their share of stationery and reinforcing their businesses with toys, but things have not changed much. Sales at the grocery store run by Mr. Lee (59) are down by 20 % from 20 years ago. Lee, who has sold up to 20 million won a day, has been posting more than 1 million won a day in sales since several years ago. As stationery usually leaves about 10 percent profit, the only money left in her hand is two million won per month. I have kept my store since 2008 by breaking pension insurance and installment savings, Lee said. Lee, who recently canceled the pension insurance for his wife of 44 million won, said, If the money does not improve, I will close after this winter. He expanded his house by wholesale stationery and education to his children's universities for more than 20 years, but he can not stand it any more. Things were similar in other shops. Han Yeong-seop, CEO of Fancy Han, sighed, saying, We cut down on our staff and tighten our belts while our wives and daughters run the store, but even paying 1.9 million won per month. Lee (38), who runs a stationery store, said in a word, "" We can't do anything without having a plan to close our store and go through it. "" Oh Se-in, a young stationery businessman, also helped us stop using handwriting as smartphones and tablet PCs spread. Oh said, If I picked up a pretty letter 30 years ago, the paper company could hang on for months, a reminder by students around the country of my past 600,000 soldiers. In the age of email and social networking services, one can not expect to have something special like this, but the times have been harsh. Failed to find a small market both on and offline is another reason why the phrase has become difficult. The offline distribution network was encroached by large household goods stores such as Daiso, and failed to reach the rapidly expanding online market. As we looked at the data on the status of expanding diso retailers and business operations published by Rep. Lee Chan-yol of the People's Party, we saw that out of the 459 % surveyed outlets surveyed in September, Daiso appeared. Diso, which had 500 outlets in 2010, doubled its number of stores by more than twice, starting its 1,000th store in 2015. Over the same period, around 6,000 stationery stores disappeared from 17,000 in 2009 to 11,000 in 2015. Another problem is the inability to get through the ' online sales ' process that is solved with a click. According to the data released by the National Statistical Office, as of October 2017, the amount of online stationery traded was 41.6 billion won, more than 2.6 times higher than the 16 billion won recorded in October 2007. As online distribution networks grew, some street vendors started selling the Internet in a belated fashion, but it was not enough to beat online experts. A year ago, a general store owner who owned an online shopping mall with the same name as well, said, "" I have sold an item worth 10,000 won for 5800 won, so I can not sell it online for 6,800 won at a profit. "" Ahn Seung-ho, business school professor at Soongsil University, said, "" People could pick out the lowest priced products online, when the seller was accustomed to having the lowest margin, and when it was possible to get products from various outlets, it was possible to sell them in a very large quantity. "" "" There is no answer. "" Most merchants shake their heads. Still, it is not easy to change the business field. Each house has tens of millions of won in stock, and hundreds of millions of won in stock, in stationery, starting with wholesale markets. When the warehouse stores change their business, they will become an embarrassment for junk merchants. Merchants who become "" hostages "" in stock will die but die and be forced to open their shop. Lee Young-jun of Shinji Circulation says, "" I close my business and sit at home, but the same is true when I open my door and can't make any money. "" He said, "" I don't even have 1,000 won to throw away inventory."
"We are opening the store because we think we should sell it, explained the situation. Some of the stores that gave their children their business as a family business are on the brink of losing their existence. Park Sang-hee (39), who has owned Sangsin for 10 years since her parents opened a stationery store, sighed deeply over how hard she was able to sell. Cho ChI-yol, who runs the stationery store from Dae-dae, grinned, saying, I could go to a warm and convenient store or a cheap diiso. Chumiran, who has been running our athletic company for 27 years, said, I don`t want to leave this lucrative and laborious task to my children. I want to end on my own. The grocer, Chang, who lives day to day selling his sellers, reiterated that there is no answer. The music of carols was greeted with melancholy strains on the sparsely dotted street. Chang's shoulders looked especially small, as she was about to open her shop without any holidays.

Mayor Lee Keun-kyu of Jecheon has a meeting with the bereaved family of Jecheon Sports Fire Center in Seoul Hospital on July 22. ▽ Pictures = Jecheon = Neosis and Lee Byung-chan : The conflicts between the fire authorities and their bereaved families are growing over the suspicion of poor response in the early stages of the Jecheon Sports Center disaster in North Chungcheong Province. The bereaved family of the fire department protested the official announcement of the fire department one by one at the joint memorial altar of the victims on July 3. The fire authorities have claimed that firefighters broke windows of illegally parked vehicles near the fire site to get into the refraction ladder, then released the brakes to help move the vehicles, bereaved families said. "" The firemen did nothing but watch, "" he said. The fire department also said the use of the bent ladder truck was delayed because of the danger of a two ton LPG tank exploding on the building and a strong fire in the parking lot. The bereaved family claimed, "" We were in a situation where firefighters could enter the second floor of the building by saving a person who hung from a rail higher than the women's room on the first floor of the fire. "" "" There was nothing but a fire in the parking lot, "" and "" nothing but a fire in the other areas "". Backdraft is a phenomenon in which small embers grow larger when oxygen is poured into a confined space, and fire authorities say entry to the second floor is delayed because of the high number of victims. But the bereaved families criticized the fire country`s slow response, saying victims who were imprisoned in the bath at the time either called their families for help or sent text messages until one hour after the fire broke out. The most frequent victim was Yeotang on the second floor of the Jecheon Sports Center disaster. Nine people died on the sixth or eighth floor of a health club, and twenty people died in the lowest women's bath in the building. Five family members listened to a police briefing on the progress of the investigation at the scene of the fire in Haso-dong, Jecheon City. Police are investigating building owners, janitors, injured people and witnesses to determine the cause of the blaze. bclee@newsis.com>"
"Jeong Gyeong-jae, a journalist who disappeared from Hyeon-bu (Jun-Cheon Yonhap), and Yeong-yang (Jeonju United News), are also missing. Police said they sent in a large number of investigators to search for the missing woman for her life, but concluded that since her earnings were not high, it was highly possible that her disappearance was involved in a violent crime. It is noteworthy whether the forced investigation will reveal the whole story of the disappearance of the mysterious Jun-hee. ◇ Jun-Hee disappeared suddenly … The belated report to the police explains the situation so far. Junhee was raised by her aunt (36) ' mother (61) in an intubation room in Inhu-dong, Deokjin-gu, Seoul, in April. Jun-hee lives in an apartment in Bongdong-eup, Wanju-gun with her biological father, and is confirmed to have been at a nearby nursery until March 30. Kim, who is paid monthly for rearing and raising Jun-hee, will move into a studio in Ua-dong on August 30. At that time, some residents also appear who saw Jun-hee. Then on July 8, the two women, Ko, and Lee, a biological mother, visited a police station and received a report of her disappearance, saying, I have not seen her since last month 18. When I lost my wife, I had a fight with Ko and asked her to pick me up, Lee told police, explaining it was too late to report. When I went to a studio in Uadong with my mom, I found no Junhee. I thought my friend took it. Police analyzed all TV sets around Ua-dong studio area, focusing on July 18, but could not find any images of her. In addition, despite repeated questioning, not a single resident appeared who said they had seen her since August 30.Police could not find out what was going on in the nearby lie detector investigation. More than 4,000 photos and personal information were distributed to the police and district stations, as well as to various utilization facilities such as stations and terminals. The number of search personnel has also increased significantly. About 200 police officers and helicopters searched every corner of the house and around Kirinbong. Police and fire authorities even launched an underwater search by floating a rubber boat in a frozen reservoir in Ajung. A massive search was conducted, along with an investigation by her father, Ko, an insider, and Kim. Police judged that the reason of their disappearance was not clear and asked all of them to undergo a lie detector test. Koh and Yi had accepted the first investigation but later refused the police request for further investigation. `` Am I the victim of losing my daughter? Or a suspect. If you continue to treat it this way, I will not respond to the probe. And Lee's mother, Kim, who was last with Jun-hee, refused to investigate the lie detector from the beginning.The police, who are searching for Jun-hee, and the forced investigation of her family members, said, "" Let's not find a clue as to where to trace her despite repeated searches. Police officials recently said, It is not common sense for a 5-year-old to suddenly disappear without leaving a trace. It is possible that he was involved in a violent crime. We are mindful of the forced investigation against our family members. Police booked two former wife Goh, one of whom was not legally married, and the other two were searched for their homes and cars on July 22. He even hired a team of scientists to conduct blood tests and examine the genes of his house. Police secured their mobile phones, computers and clothes by searching for them. Police will analyze text messages, Internet censorship records, and clues that could be on her clothes and identify her whereabouts. We can`t make a conclusion that the family was directly involved in the disappearance of Miss Jun-hee on the evidence we brought the other day, said Kim Yeon-keun, head of the prosecutor`s investigation team, adding, We have made it clear during a further investigation that our family members ` disappearance plan. jaya@yna.co.kr ▶ Report to the UN Security Council and inquiry (Click!) Summery Security Council Resolution on North Korea (PG) The level of resistance from North Korea is expected to significantly determine the situation on the Korean Peninsula before the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. As North Korea declares it will complete its nuclear weapons program, it is expected to be a significant factor in the expectation of a turnaround in the negotiations next year. Whenever a resolution to impose sanctions was adopted by the Security Council, North Korea immediately protested strongly, citing violations of its sovereignty, and launching missiles to protest against it. Three days after the Security Council voted to impose sanctions on North Korea in September, South Korea launched a ballistic missile that landed on the North Pacific Ocean over Japan. When the Security Council imposed sanctions on North Korea in August to launch a coast-to-coast ballistic missile (ICT-14) chain, it launched a medium range ballistic missile (IRC) of 1) in July.Given this example, it is possible North Korea will not let it pass this time either. The resolution could deal a serious blow to the North Korean economy by designating the repatriation of all overseas workers within 24 months and reducing the annual supply of refinery products by 90 percent compared to the pre-taxation measure. Given that the level of resistance from North Korea has been proportional to the level of sanctions, it is also possible that North Korea will not be able to test fire an ICP-class missile or a new submarine-launched ballistic missile or launch an additional nuclear test. If this occurs, it is feared that the situation on the Korean Peninsula will again freeze sharply. The government's plan to turn the mood surrounding the Korean Peninsula into a flow of dialogue could also be hit by the Pyeongchang Olympics, while the U.S. might see its dialogue line become more cautious and military options retract. South Korea and the United States are considering delaying the joint military training so that it will not overlap with the Pyeongchang Games, which is also likely to be scrapped. Unification Minister Cho Myung-kyoon said in a special lecture on the standing committee of the Unification Advisory Council on Democratic and Peaceful Unification on July 20, "" If North Korea makes such a provocation such as a missile test, the combined training between the U.S. and South Korea will not be possible (as usual). "" However, some analysts say it remains to be seen whether North Korea will go further than just responding with words to itself to act like a missile launch. If North Korea declares it complete its nuclear weapons program and is willing to negotiate with the U.S. for economic construction and easing sanctions in the New Year, the level of resistance can be adjusted to avoid upsetting the plate. If the North responds with low intensity, such as by issuing a statement of censure or launching a projectile instead of a ballistic missile, it is expected that the situation will continue. Koh Yu-hwan, a professor at Dongguk University, said North Korea has almost invariably faced provocation with the Security Council's sanctions, but this time, it is unlikely to respond with a strong provocation because the North has declared its completion of its nuclear weapons. transil@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"Occheol Correspondent : Last year, the space launch time for U.S. private space agency Space-X, the world's first successful space rocket this year led by Tesla's CEO, was recorded on July 9.U.S. space explorer William Harwood, who led the space mission for the space network CBS News, said the number of space X-rays this year will be a record for commercial rockets launching. The Falcon 9 rocket carried 10 next communication satellites of carrier iridium. Space X, which has advocated a recycling rocket launch, is the fifth one to launch a recycling propulsion system. Falcon 9, the first stage propeller, has been collected and reused from barge containers in the Pacific. The launch marks the end of Space X's space project this year. The rocket propulsion system, which was launched from the Bandenberg Air Force Base in California, is not planned to be recycled again. Instead, engineers have reportedly carried out several tests on first-stage propellant removal. As the rocket was launched, Twitter followed by a series of pictures of beautiful propellants drawn on the California night sky. The Space X-Rockett Propeller II propulsion system, which is posted on Twitter, places 10 iridium satellite networks in the Earth's polar sector orbit. Iridium's replacement of communication satellite costs $ 3 billion (3.2 trillion won) and is a huge project. A total of 81 satellites will cluster to provide voice and data services in Earth's orbit. On January 14 of this year, Space X successfully launched its first iridium-mounted satellite, and launch an iridium loaded rocket into space in June and August. This is the fourth project to launch iridium. In January of next year, Space-X will face a new dream long waited for the company. Tesla's Roadster Sports Car is scheduled to launch a high-load Falcon. Last September, Space X was preparing to launch a Falcon 9 rocket at a Capernaberral base in Florida when the rocket exploded during an engine test. Although there were no casualties, the rocket went missing and broke the launch pad, dealing a financial blow worth more than $ 200 million. The U.S. media then reported that the company started launching Falcon 9 in January of this year and made 2017 the first year of its recyclable rocket era by launching its 18th rocket. ▶ oakchul@yna.co.kr driver information and contact (Click!) the latest fashion trend area, all (Click!)

The fire burned the exterior walls black and broke most of the windows. Jecheon : Choi Hyuk-jung, a reporter at the Korea Sports Center in Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province, brutally killed and killed the mothers who sacrificed themselves for their families. Choi (46), who was on a high school uniform at Myeongji Hospital in Jecheon on July 22, was about to cry. "" I told you I was enrolled in college, so I told you to go to Vietnam next January. What is superwoman ... "" Choi, who died, always said, "" If I stick to my daughter's university, let's go abroad on family tours. "" Choi was a ' superwoman ' to her family. Choi, who was a cook at a high school cafeteria in Jecheon, recently delivered milk and newspapers to pay for her daily expenses. Still, he never missed a day of exercise. On the day of the tragedy, he was in charge of lunch and went to a sports center to do exercises. If she worried about why you were working so hard, she laughed away, Mom, this is how to raise three children. Choi called her father-in-law and mother-in-law "" daddy and mommy. "" The son was always a feather in his cap to him. Choi was proud of her daughter who went to a university in Seoul without ever taking any lessons. The second child entered university frequently this year thanks to her help in English. "" However, Choi last called her husband Lee (51) at around 4:15 p.m. the previous day, "" Honey, I'm really on fire here … I'm on the rooftop now … "" I haven't heard from her anymore. Firefighters found his body on the seventh floor of the Sports Center. In front of the photo, the husband wept with the children. Chung (56), who passed away after leaving her daughter at the age of 15, was a strict but determined mother. Jung often scolded his daughter by saying, "" Live the world strongly. "" Before going to the bath on the second floor of the sports center, he went to his daughter's middle school. She usually had a bag full of her daughter's favorite brownies in it. Jung handed her an envelope and said, "" It's a festival today. Have a nice meal with your friends. "" The words of Chung, who saw her in the evening after the festival, were a ' will. ' Jeong's daughter cried, saying, I am so tall. Another sports center worker, Chung, 53, who could not jump out of the second floor window and passed away, could not pass by when she saw a person in need. Jeong, who runs a restaurant, carried the briquet to his brother's house in winter, where he had to endure harsh winter. I also went overseas to do volunteer work. Chung recently renewed his long break from exercising, saying, You must work hard to get good at volunteer work. On the day of the accident, he had to take a bath after finishing his exercise and suffered a bowel movement. Chung's daughter thought her mother was too eager to help the elderly to answer the phone. The daughter who came from Kwangju to the step forward collapsed before her mother's closed eyes. A mortuary for an 18-year-old student who was scheduled to enter a Seoul Women's University as a scholarship student was set up at the Bogung funeral hall in Jecheon on that day. Kim, who loved chemistry very much, was also planning to major in chemical engineering at university. Upon the day of the accident, she went to the sports center to see an interview when she heard that she was looking for an art student. He said, "" I don't want to open my hands to my parents who run a chicken restaurant, "" adding, "" As soon as the announcement of the successful candidate came, I started looking for a part-time job. "" Parents said they still can not believe her death. Kim's grandfather stole her eyes, saying, I have been a good granddaughter who used the pocket money I gave to buy nutrients or clothes during the holidays. The graduation photo taken in May this year was a portrait. The woman with long, straight hair was smiling brightly. Shin (53), who raised her own son well, also encountered an older brother with a cold body.

The search is complete and primary screening is complete. Police have secured and restored four vehicle black boxes. It was believed that the fire originated in a parking lot vehicle. But today's JTBC video confirms that when it caught on fire, the fire was first coming out of the parking lot ceiling. So it's in accordance with fire authorities ' explanation that it looks like the fire started from the ceiling, not from the car. First, this is a report by reporter Yoon Jae-young. [reporter] There's a fireball coming down from the ceiling.3:54 p.m. Right after it was received.The heated installation was reportedly in full swing in the parking lot on the first floor before the fire was seen.Firefighters say the fire started during the project.  After two minutes of filing, the building begins to emit black smoke.After 3 minutes, the flame is visible from far away.By the end of the four minutes, they're burning the exterior walls of the building.The fire, which started in the parking lot on the first floor, took less than five minutes to swallow the entire building floor.Within seven minutes of reporting, the fire truck arrives on site. But because of the parked cars, they can't get close to the building.The people who are in a hurry are pushing the car with their hands. But it won't budge.Fourteen minutes after the fire truck arrived, the rescue ladder truck arrived on site.I had to come back about 500 meters.But also because of the parked cars, they can't get space.It takes 13 minutes to reach the ladder.When the tow truck arrives, each of the illegally parked vehicles is ejected.It took about 50 minutes after the first fire report to get the rescue going."
"The evolution of the crisper is a DNA repair tool. Cut the exact part of a gene that needs to be fixed. You can also put new DNA in the hole. Recently, new techniques have been introduced to select the DNA molecule that causes the disease and convert it into another one. The chemical and biological research institute at Harvard University in the U.S., Gaocher University, has been engaged in experiments on white mice throughout this year. The name of the mouse was the same as the name of a composer Beethoven. The mouse is not named for its excellent musical talent. In fact, it is not Dr. Gao who named the books. Israeli scientists, who first created and named the mouse in 2002, noted that one characteristic was different from a normal mouse. That is, I can't hear. Composer Ludwig van Beethoven, who performed in the 18th and 19th centuries, lost his hearing when he was almost 44, unable to hear well since he was in his late 20s. The reason why he lost his hearing is unknown, but it is believed to be either the aftermath of an acquired disease or one of the genetic causes. Scientists were interested in the genetic material between the two. Then they found a gene which causes hearing loss after tests using rats. When the gene T 1 is different from normal (if there is a mutation in this gene), some waste protein is also deposited in the auditory signal production cell (nanny cell) inside the inner cochlea. When waste material builds up, the nurse cells die and their hearing becomes weaker, and after 10 to 15 years, they are completely deaf. It is not a coincidence but it is similar to the time it took Beethoven to lose his hearing. Scientists who have tried to solve the problem of innate hearing loss have been researching solutions using Beethoven's mouse. The easiest method is to remove the defective part of the T C1 gene. It was simple in theory. DNA is a language of four molecules A, T, G and C. Tm c is also part of that DNA. The mutation of a T C1 gene occurs when only one character intercepts in the middle. That means that one part of the DNA alone can solve the problem of hearing loss. But there are problems. DNA is not a material that can be detached or changed so easily. First of all, it's very small. Often the thickness of a single strand of DNA, described as a double helix, is one micronite of hair (nanometre, one nanometer is one billionto nanometers), and is so tiny that no manmade tool can be cut off. And DNA itself was a kind of database of life information, so it was extremely resistant to change. DNA is the bio-molecular material that is as strong as wire and as tough as elastic. David Yoo, a professor at Harvard University, has made the biggest breakthrough in the field of gene correction tools this year. A gene editor that allows us to make further improvements to the crisis-known crisper-the ability to directly modify individual molecules.Dr. Gao had a weapon. It was Chrisper, the gene correction technology that has become the biggest talk of the life sciences in the last few years. Often referred to as genetic scissors, the technique has the ability to cut the desired part from thin and tough DNA with high accuracy. This is so accurate that it can pick out a candidate from three billion DNA to one, including an average goal. It might seem like a quite pathetic ability to find 90 suspects in an investigation to find a single criminal, but if the target is about half (3 billion) of the global population, it is a different story. It is a stunning accuracy with a 0.000003 % chance. Gao announced in the journal Nature the results of the treatment of hearing loss by placing a Krisper molecule in the ears of mice and cutting out the self-induced deafness gene. The case, which directly cured incurable diseases, is a part of a revolution led by Krisper Technology this year. Successful treatment for diseases is on the rise. In February this year, Professor Kim Jeong-hoon of Seoul National University Hospital and Kim Jin-soo, head of the Research Center for Basic Science (IBS) Research at the Korea Research Institute of Genometry and Research, successfully cured senile degeneration by encapsulating a crist. Elderly macular degeneration is a disease that causes blindness when blood vessels grow in spots that should have no blood vessels, and causes blindness, accounting for 5 percent of the causes. This August, Kim Jin-soo, along with a team of scientists at the University of Oregon's University of Health and Science, first applied clisper to human embryos to treat congenital myocardial infarction. We have corrected mutations from human embryos to crispers, boosting the chances of stopping inheritance, Kim said. The second innovation is the advancement of the Krisper technology itself. In particular, the accuracy of the test was higher. Krisper is a biomolecular machine with two main components. There is one part that contains information so you can find the DNA you want, and one part that actually cuts it off is a kind of cutting enzyme. The most widely studied Krisper is Krisper-Cass 9, which uses ' cass 9 ' as the cutting enzyme. In 2015, Chang Peeng's team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed a new gene scissors, ' Krisper- Cp f, ' using an enzyme that is more accurate than Cass9. Kim's team studied the accuracy of the new crisfer- Cp f 1 in June last year compared to the existing Krisper-Cass 9. The new crisper is more accurate, with only one target out of three billion pairs of DNA. It is 0.00000003 % chance. Kim's team also successfully tested animals that changed the color of their fur with this technique. There is also a new technique to calibrate the next generation of genes, which works on entirely new principles. The technology, nicknamed the "" gene editor, "" was re-enlightened as an upgraded science in October this year after making its debut incomplete last year. David Ryu, a Harvard professor who invented the gene editing machine, was named the "" Person of the Year "" by the British science magazine Nature on July 15, and the gene editing machine was also selected as the "" Science "" by the U.S. teenager. Genetic editors are able to calibrate a single point of DNA more precisely than Krisper. That is because they can choose only one letter that they want to correct in the four-letter letters - A, T, G and C - and replace it immediately. Krisper-Cass 9 or Crisper- Cp f1 is calibrated by finding the target gene, cutting off a pair of DNA (two strands) and inserting the new DNA. Because of this, it has been criticized for being a slightly less sophisticated method. Genetic editors are different. The precise nature of the painting is that it is replaced by a chemical method by the correct letter. Professor Ryu likened the previous Krisper to being as blunt as a large knife and the genetic editor to be as sharp as a precision chemical procedure, during an interview with Nature in October. According to Kim's experiment, the chance of unwanted DNA being cut is higher than one-third that of Krisper-Cass 9, which makes it more accurate. According to the World Health Organization, there are over 10,000 genetic diseases caused by mutations in one gene. Examples are hemophilia, sickle cell anemia and Huntington's disease. Genetic editors are expected to be of great help in curing these diseases. It is still hard to imagine how far gene correction will go. Despite its huge achievements this year, there is still much room for innovation as a young technology. The utilization range will be much wider. In addition to disease treatment, studies in China and Europe are actively applied to improve crops to increase food production.Yoon Shin-young, a reporter for Donga Science ashilla@donga.com ▶ Official Facebook of The Dong-A Ilbo / The Dong-A Ilbo / The newspaper must not be redistributed illegally, and with the Donga.com account of hot economic issues and re-teaction methods."

"" The union voted on whether to accept the temporary agreement with 58,890 union members on July 23, and found that 45.28 percent (88.44 percent) voted in favor of the agreement, and that 52.24 percent voted against it. The agreement failed to reach an agreement within this year, as a vote on the tentative agreement was rejected by the union members. Labor and management are expected to begin retaking their education soon. The reason for the rejection was, in turn, that the wage increase was lower than usual. Labor union officials also said the rejection was due to the wage shortfall from previous years. Labor and management reached a tentative agreement in the 39th round of negotiations held at the Ulsan factory on July 19. Among the tentative agreement, the wage sector would receive a 58,000 won increase, pay 300 percent plus 2.8 million won in compensation, and support 200,000 points in purchasing products from small and mid-sized companies. Last year, he agreed to pay 72,000 won more, pay a bonus and other encouragement fee of 350 percent + 3.3 million won, 500,000 won in traditional market certificates, and 10 weeks of stock. In particular, the agreement was re-developed after it was first rejected by the union members in a vote. Labor and management also agreed to hire 350 more in-house sub-contractor workers by 2021 by this year`s executive committee. In addition, the organization will set up a special fund for social contribution of 3 billion won over three years. The union went on strike 19 times during the parliamentary committee this year, which resulted in production losses of 1.31 trillion won for 62,600 units, the company estimated. The union will hold a negotiation team meeting on July 26 to discuss its future plans. young@yna.co.kr ▶ Report and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!) 【 Jecheon = New Sisse&amp;Injinyeon reporter for the inspection team of National Scientific Investigation Team and the National Fire Inspection Center in Jecheon, on the 23rd ▽ New Sissest=Lee Byeong-Chan, reporter of 2017.12.23. = As police investigate the building manager of Jecheon Sports Center in North Chungcheong Province, questions are growing over the cause of the fire. It was originally reported that he fired due to unknown reasons during construction of electric wiring on the roof of the parking lot on the ground floor or water-tube heating work, but many say he did not. The fire department of Jecheon Sports Club, North Chungcheong Province, summoned building owners, managers, witnesses, and injuries on July 23 as witnesses. Building managers said they had "" new water frozen in the ceiling drain on the first floor, and they didn't do any ice removal work on the day of the fire, "" but "" no lights were installed on the tubes and so forth. "" It is true that they have been able to remove the ice, but they point out that they did not use any weapon to cause the fire. However, it is clear that the construction of the Filrotti Parking Lot on the first floor has been completed due to problems. A sports center official who met with reporters at the joint memorial service for the victims of the National Territory of Jeju Island also complained, "" There were many occasions when water leaked from the parking lot, and the superintendent also had too many things to do. "" Building officials claim that they have not made any more ' dangerous ' attempts to light the pipes on the parking lot ceiling, with no apparent cause of fire, such as electric work to prevent domes or welding. "" When melting pipes, cover the coil and heat them with electricity or with a torch "" said an official at the plumbing and installation sites, but metal pipes can not use a fire. Regarding the third day of the fire at Jecheon Sports Center, a senior official of the building said, "" I apologized to my bereaved family for the incident. International waters and fire authorities at kkssmm99@newsis.com are saying, "" The fire started on the ceiling, "" through an examination of the nose and surrounding CCTVs. One can easily see flames on the ceiling even in the CCTV footage that was released. But it is up to the police to find out why the ceiling caught fire. Building officials insisted no fire was used, and police explained that no one was found in the parking lot when the fire broke out. If it is true that there was no use of firearms and no one was found in the parking lot at the time of the fire, it is inevitable to revise the existing theory that the use of torches, styrofoam, and other flammable materials ignited. The sports center, which has a total area of 3113 ㎡, on the ninth and first basement floors, recently remodeled it. A fire started at the parking lot on the ground floor on July 21, quickly swallowed the entire building, killing 20 women in a bath. bclee@newsis.com>"
"EDALEY : Yesterday (22) at the Household Communications Policy Council, the first time the government announced that it would be talking about a fee system, the "" Universal Rate System, "" was to blame.Samsung Group Chairman Lee Dong-sab and the conservative phone industry were concerned (opposite) about the deterioration in management due to the government's excessive intervention in the market, while civic groups and the government were in favor of expanding consumer benefits by reducing communication costs.As such, even if we discuss supplementary issues at the next meeting on January 12 next year, it is questionable whether we can bridge the gap.Regarding the Universal Rate System, Science and Technology Minister Yoo Young-min told a press conference yesterday that "" I don't know what the global rate system will be like, but I don't know how it will turn out, and saving phones will go further. ""◇ The fifth meeting between Iton-2.1 and the National Science and Technology Association held on July 22 between 2:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. concerning the restriction of competition and deterioration in business, and the Universal Association of Consumer and Commercial Companies ` Association, which the government is pushing for legislation.While agreeing to the idea of easing the burden of communication costs, the company stressed that the universal rate system is an excessive intervention by the government and runs counter to the policy of boosting the market competition that the government has been pursuing.Comparing universal rate system to foreign regulations, it is possible to say that it is excessive and that it could limit the competitiveness of the market, especially when it is adopted, such as by artificial pricing, and by limiting the investment of companies.◇ Consumers and civic groups ` support for reducing fees, and groups of consumers and citizens ' groups say that lower rates should have an effect on the people's communication costs by encouraging them to pay less money, and that the universal rate system would lead to a reduction in communication costs.However, it was suggested that the volume of manufacturing (speech 200 minutes, data 1G) currently referred to as the universal rate system would need to be increased to reflect consumer usage, etc.◇ Government needs to be strongly involved in a ' market failure ' The government has limited market discrimination, with the benefits of lower rates relatively modest, and the benefits of the companies competing against each other have not increased enough.The government will introduce a universal fare system that gives the right to set the system after the market failed.It was suggested that the universal rate system should be adopted to address the inevitable increase in data consumption.◇ Saverphone, ` Activate the frugal phone system instead of the universal rate system `, and the Saverphone Association, along with worries that the loss of the main rate system could add significantly to the difficulties of saving phone users and mobile phones.The government's 200-minute voice and 10,000-won data standard for 1G is already available on a frugal phone.As part of the plan, it was suggested that the government should reduce the radio wave service fees, improve the method of calculating wholesale prices, and provide distribution networks and public relations support.The Korea Distribution Association suggested that the companies should take an aggressive stance to ease the public's burden of communication.Please subscribe to "" IdalI "" at (chaos@edaily.co.kr) On the second floor of the building, 20 sauna users and 9 people died in all. On the other hand, passengers on the third and fifth floors of the men's sauna moved out to the emergency stairs and lived there. The survivors said, "" It is because there is a proper escape route, but no one knew or had to escort. ""■ Emergency stairs divided between life and death, survivors of the daily paper said in unison, "" The reason why the damage was so great in the sauna on the second floor was due to the failure of the emergency staircase. "" Park Gyu-yeon (12), who was in the sauna on the third floor and walked out of the barbershop emergency staircase, said, I was in the bathroom with a friend when I saw smoke and fire outside my blind window, and I could not even wear my shorts. Park was led by a barber named Kim Jong-su (64) to evacuate. But `` I haven't seen anyone coming out of the emergency staircase on the second floor (with a women's sauna). '' Cho (48), who used the sauna frequently, said, "" I don't think men's sauna would have been able to take me to safety. Some users said, We had a washbasin stand in front of the fire escape stand, so we were not allowed to use the fire escape stairs.■ Most of the 20 people who died on the second floor of the sauna entrance on the second floor were found in front of the sauna entrance door. The second floor is the one closest to the fire point on the first floor, so it is the one with the strongest smoke and fire. Although emergency stairs were placed at each floor, it is most likely that they were carried to the door without knowing that they existed, and were choked to death by smoke.Some say the door button did not work properly. When you were evacuated from the sauna on the third floor, the door opened several times after pressing the door button, Kim Chang-yeon, 76, said, The second floor was in a similar situation. Another reason for the deaths is that the toxic fumes that flowed into the second floor could not be released due to the windows that are difficult to break. A building owner Lee told police to evacuate the building, but failed to get into the sauna on the second floor and yelled out only from the door.■ High-story pizzas are poisonous and nine victims are from the bottom 6 to 8. Smoke during the fire seemed to choke on the toxic fumes because of the upward tendency. Usually the smoke was the first step up, but in this case, the steps were quickly taken to fill the air space, a fire department official said on the phone.The delayed rescue also caused damage. Firefighters said the rescue efforts were not easy in the latest accident, however, to start at the top, as smoke from the building fire was concentrated upwards. A nearby resident Kim said, The helicopter hovered around because of smoke, and the fire ladder truck was behind schedule and the ladder was not properly unfolded."
"Lee Dae-sik, the head of Samsangi Cooking Contest for over 160 years old. While I was working as the CEO of an American company, I enjoyed cooking at retirement high school five years ago. "" My wife's day care … "" My husband and "" My husband's privileges are improving. "" It is the first time in three years that a senior cooking class organized by the Apkujung Center for the Elderly was established. In his manipulation of the exhibition, he produces a force no less than a five-star hotel kitchen. A gamekeeper is not a feat to catch two or three knives. At first glance, it is like a hotel manager. Pour in half a cup of bread crumbs, mix with water, wash it with cold water, and then cut the green chives into 4cm long pieces. For a neat appearance, the front ends and the male side slashes. Cut pumpkin and perilla leaves into thin pieces and wash the shrimp, squid, and clams in one bite with clean water. Put the frying pan over high heat, add the canola oil, and gently place your hand over the frying pan to see if the oil is heated. "" There! "" he said, as he puts the round dough in the frying pan, the chives plant begins to sizzle and get tender. On the afternoon of July 14, at the School of Lifelong Learning in Apgujeong-dong, Gangnam-gu, this meticulous chef who does not mix red peppers diagonally in the dough and puts them on top of seafood contests "" Samsik (69) is honored. "" The SamchangI Cooking Contest, which was held annually by Mapo-gu, Seoul, is an event in which retired cooking experts aged 60 or over, who used to show off their talents in cooking with their wives ' help, can be seen as an event that is not just by the cooking experts. This is the first time that she has ever used a knife and cutting board in a cooking class for a male student at Apgujeong Senior Welfare Center three years ago. Lee Dae-sik, the winner of the Samsangi Cooking Contest, gives a serious look at his grandfather's first-class cuisine. Lee, who is a 67-year-old management major at Seoul National University, retired five years ago as the CEO of a Korean subsidiary of BorgWarner Corporation. Although the company has been in Changwon for 15 years as a weekend couple, it has been enough to cook ramen due to the high number of meals. Having been to the men's cooking class at the senior center as if to follow a friend as suggested by a group of friends who had begun their retirement, he fell in love with cooking. I went to cooking class for one season every year for three years."" I used to glance out of the back of the sink and see what my wife would do for me today. But now, if there is anything I want to eat, make some ingredients and eat it together. So I gained self-esteem and increased self-confidence. I don't have a problem with that either. I can do anything without you!`` It was a great stir when news of his grand prize went to Katok by family, friends and neighbors. In particular, her friends reacted enthusiastically. "" You would be so nice, everyone would envy you. "" I have two sons and two wives, but nowadays I cook and eat twice a week. I also liked Galchi jorim and oyster soup yesterday, "" which defines the position of an elderly family man who would eat at home after retirement. If you don't eat a single meal, it's a joke : ' Young-sik ' ; if you eat two meals, ' I sik gun ' ; if you eat three meals in a long time, ' sam sik inom ' is a joke. That's the kind of joke a wife can tell when she is healthy. Older wives are often sick, and sometimes they get hospitalized. My rice needs to be boiled with even short rice. The sudden rush of the kitchen as you look around is the fear and fear of maybe being left alone. It's too far from the world to say that the cooking man is sexy. The age when cooking is needed for survival is at an early age. The old, large family system in which daughters used to feed their children without wives or wives has disappeared. But many elderly men still think that cooking is not my business. It is not all about the loss of a wife. My meals are no longer a priority for grandchildren's wives. A man in his 70s who went to a villa in Gangwon Province quietly cooled was trapped by heavy snow. I could not drive from the mountain cottage to the restaurant or find any of the usual convenience stores. There was rice at the villa, but I couldn't cook. After spending nearly three days starving while staying on a reserve snack, he was able to get out of the car only after the traffic control was lifted. Cooking is a technique of survival. Lee Dae-sik, who studied cooking at the Apkujung Elderly Welfare Center, won the Samsang Food Contest, and cooked the dish in high temperature to make it crisp and yellowish. Bae Woo-han's training program is most urgent for reporters, who ran two ' happiness cooking men ' courses this year at the Apgujeong Senior Welfare Center, where Sam-sik's grandfather had submitted the grand prize for a cooking contest. When the second closing ceremony of the program was held on July 14, when 12 retired men participated, the lecture room was full of thoughts and suggestions from their grandparents who had completed three months of cooking practice. Lee Jang-won (73), a bank teller, said, "" Men really have to learn cooking. "" He said, "" If you go to a group of friends and tell them what you're doing, they agree with you. "" "" My partner is sick. Can I ask him to cook for me? In the past, it was awkward and awkward to stand in front of the sink even if I wanted to, but now I feel confident after learning cooking. And the basic thing of cooking is washing the dishes. I have to do this perfectly. It was less awkward to be in front of a cutting board, so she now says, ' Cut the onions, cut the onions, cut the onions. ' "" I'd be very happy to, "" said one of the students who spent three months cooking at the Seoul Senior Welfare Center's Men's cooking class, during the closing ceremony on July 14. Yoon Yang-soo (70), who retired from the office of the Park Sun-young, said, "" Now the gender dichotomy is falling, "" and added, "" We don't teach family subjects to boys in middle and high school. "" "" There's nothing for a woman to do, and nothing for a man to do, "" she said. The world is changing fast. It's not just cooking. I don't know why they didn't teach us to sew. I should have taught girls how to get to the light bulb. "" "" No, I went to the academy to learn cooking, and I found it hard for an elderly lady to get accepted. "" (She retired as an educator) "" What I learned was that the menus were good enough for the elderly to handle wives alone. When our grandchildren come here, I can show off some of the foods I can boast about, like the dishes my grandparents gave me, like the pasta that my children love, in a program or two, slowly change and I don't think we can learn the names. In recent months, the Seoul Central District Office's Low Salt Recipe Cooking Classroom, Seoul's Nowon 50Plus Center for the Elderly, and the Gwangju Regional Office of Middle and South Gyeongsang Province's Chodong Women's Kitchen, were opened as free cooking classes. There is certainly a demand. Each program is fiercely competing to be accepted, and programs that started off on a one-time basis are being played one after another. "" I wanted to sign up for the first round but it was closed in two hours. So, in the second phase, I was on the phone at 8:50 a.m. to prepare for the opening of the wedding hall at 9 a.m. I was told, "" After 22 years of working as a professional soldier and working in Gwangju, my wife and I moved out of the business. She often went out to meet her friends, had many days to cook ramen alone, and was ' bound to change ' seriously. If I stick to my past authority, I am the only one who is hurt and damaged. When I left, I went out to society, and I saw through it quickly. The same goes for the home. You say a man has to die for his family to live. You should lie down flat."" Men in the Man's Cooking Class, "" organized by Dong-gu Office in Gwangju, on July 13 took intensive cooking lessons. Among the 40 students who came to learn and survive, the competition was fierce Choi Yong-ju, 70, head of a Community Credit Cooperative Federation in Dong-gu, is a cooking maniac who takes notes of recipes while eagerly watching TV programs, saying, Men should know how to cook. "" Older people should change as times go by. I also insist that my sons know how to cook, and when my wives come home, I make chicken stew myself. His daughters-in-law ' cooking lessons were even more delicious than their mother-in-law's. "" And the reason he had found the recipe out there was because he hadn't tried his own recipe, even though he hadn't. "" I learned this time that there was a sunseo. It was much simpler and more systematic, as my teacher taught me. "" "" Many of my friends, Kim Gun-jin (65, who learned to cook with me at the National Highway Traffic Agency, said, "" I still have a lot of friends. "" "" Some people say, ' Be a man. Go into the kitchen. What are you doing? '"
"Ah. However, many of my friends say that they never imagined their lives as a single person. I guess that's a tough time for you, because I felt I had to forget about the patriarchy and let go of the privilege of being the head of the family. This is survival skills, and I wanted to make sure I knew. "" Fish paste made by students in the men's cooking class at Nowon 50 Plus Center in Seoul. Because of the nature of the caring labor, various chemical reactions occur inside. Byun Geum-cheol (58, Dong-gu, Gwangju), who runs a real estate market with his wife, left the office two hours earlier than her wife, but she had to have dinner with her wife who arrived home at eight. After the meal, it was 10 pm. It was an uncomfortable life. Now, with mackerel stew, anchovies, egg rolls and boiled eggs learned from the cooking class, I plan to set the table before my wife returns. Why can't I do what my wife has done for me for a long time? He boasts of being so good that it is almost impossible to imagine the art of learning from experts. Kim Tae-seong (60, Gu Office), who had studied cooking at Nowon 50 Plus Center for 10 months, also said, "" Cooking reduced my wife's hard work entirely. "" "" I used to watch my wife cook and wonder what would take so long. And it wasn't until I did it that I realized how hard it was. I thought all I had to do was make money. Now that she's had a hard time, I feel thankful to have lived with me. When I cooked oyster for them, they loved it. Still, she was not sure about my food and wouldn't want to eat it. "" I'm impressed when I ask you to cook for me, "" she said, "" but since then, when I go on a journey, I make sure to cook with my friends and make them delicious. "" I cook for you. Why? Because I like and care about you. Because I love you A hand of a grandfater who cuts fish cakes in a clumsy but meticulous manner. "" Cooking is a very good way to help someone. It is very hard for me to please by doing calligraphy. But can you serve food? It's an easy service tool. "" Lee Dae-sik, who shines at the target of the meal, goes to Dosan Park every Sunday morning. When the young people on Saturday spent the burning day have taken their mark for the cleaning workers who rest on Sundays, volunteers work hard for each other, thank you, and greet each other. "" It is very rewarding. I play often because I like golf, but no matter how many days I play, no one says I have worked hard. That's what you do for me. But neither does cooking. If the caring spirit of cooking reaches not only the family but also the neighbors and the community, wouldn't it be a better society? Dividing home affairs without distinction, sharing food, and enjoying it to society, and now leading up to the trend. "" But even grandmother-making can afford to be a irreversible trend. Kim Young-song (72), who retired as an education official in Dong-gu, Gwangju, succeeded in learning the basic principles of cooking thanks to her recent cooking class. Now, most recipes are read by themselves and are delicious. The students complained about the egg rolls, but dried them conveniently according to the instructor's instructions. "" I taught my sons and daughters to be quiet. You must cook at least once a day to share the lyrics. Why do you take the daughter of someone else's home to suffer? But I had a worry because my dish was so delicious. I'm afraid my wife would ask me to finish three meals altogether, so I'm concerned about it these days. Haha.

' Through the emergency exit on the second floor of Jecheon Sports Center on the same floor of Chungbuk Province The victims of sauna on the second floor were 20 people. Most of them would have lived in the same place if they had been able to find the correct emergency exit during the fire on July 21. However, the exit on the second floor was locked. The exit ramp was blocked. Most sauna bath holders on the third floor who had always opened their emergency doors escaped early on. There were no victims. An emergency exit divided life and death.○ The iron gate for the exit on the second floor was wide open on July 22. The walls next to the burnt iron gate were clear with white palms. It appears to have been a scar from firefighters who climbed up the fire escape stairs to the inside during the fire. The lock was dented, as if forced to open the door. Right in front of the emergency exit is an iron storage area with bath equipment for guests, which is two meters tall. It is on both sides of the door and on the other side. The emergency exit was about one meter wide, but it had been narrowed down to about 50 centimeters due to storage. The smoke from the ground floor made the interior of the bath sooty. The floor was saturated with fire water. However, there were few traces of burnt cars. Hair dryers and fans in hair drying areas were also in good shape. As if the fire had not turned on, the whole mirror had remained intact. Survivors said more than 10 guests were inside the sauna during the fire. Due to the nature of the bath, it was hard to know what was going on outside. The siren sounded, but most of the time it didn't recognize. `` I and the counter woman yelled, but most of the customers in the bath were so busy they could not hear well, '' one 50-year-old survivor said. Most of the guests in the bath seem to have been poisoned when they were getting out of the room because they were aware of the fire. Eleven people were found dead in front of the sauna gate leading to the central staircase. The door will not open until you press a small button. It is highly possible that they did not work properly in a tense situation. An official with the sauna said, The long-looking door buttons do not work normally, so I put a red sticker on them, ' Just push them here '. The rest of the dead were found near the locker room. Fire Service said the area was spread out over a distance of more than five meters from the emergency exit. If they found the exit, they could live. A building owner Lee (53) said yesterday, "" Customers complained of possible theft of bath equipment and locked the door of the exit and left an iron storage area. ""The opposite was the third floor of Namtang with a sauna like "" One second late. "" There is a barbershop in front of the exit on the third floor. The perimeter is completely open. Location of emergency exits can also be identified in lounge. Most of all, it was open 24 hours. At the time of the accident, a 63-year-old barber guided his customers to the emergency exit, leaving few deaths among male customers. If the cottontail user came out through the emergency exit just downstairs, she could get out using the same emergency staircase. We were the last to lead our customers there because the exit location was inside our heads, Kim said. Many of the women who were in sauna on the second floor tried to escape to the central staircase after pulling out the front door. According to the testimony of survivors, most of them could not go down to the stairs between the first and second floors without their clothes on, but could not go down any farther due to thick smoke. Then, they threw the pot away in an urgent spirit to break the glass frame, but it didn't work. It was tempered glass. The last living road was the sliding window, one meter wide and 70 cm long, and the users of the bath opened it with a cough in the smoky smoke and pushed their bodies in through it. He managed to escape by jumping two meters down. Some men who came down from the health club on the fourth and seventh floors helped women players on the second floor escape first. `` A fire started from behind as I walked out the window. If we were one second late, we would have died.○ The "" poorly maintained "" sports center building was inspected by fire late last month. According to the inspection results that Dong-A Ilbo checked, sprinklers in the main entrance and basement machine rooms need to be repaired. Eighteen fire sensors were cut off for human casualties. There were three new locations that needed to be installed, and five failed operations. In addition, evacuation guidance did not work properly on the first, third, fourth, sixth and seventh floors. Some also point out that fire extinguishers on emergency stairs must be replaced and the siren fails to operate, which requires repair.

"The United Nations Security Council has passed a new resolution to pressure North Korea to continue its nuclear and missile provocations. The key is to tighten the supply of oil products for vehicles or heating to near the bottom and close the source of the foreign currency earnings. I am Kim Min-ji, reporter. The 10th resolution has been adopted unanimously by the United Nations Security Council. The main deterrent is to stop the supply of petroleum refining, cutting the supply of petroleum refining, like gasoline and kerosene, to half a million barrels, while cutting off 90 percent of our supply. [NIKI HALLY / UNSC ambassador to the United Nations] "" The Security Council worked together 10 times to fight against the North, who refuses to make peace. We will take stronger measures according to the resolution (if North Korea invalids itself again). "" The measure calls for the repatriation of migrant workers sent abroad to North Korea within two years of being forced to make a foreign currency payment. Foreign currency imports are likely to fall by as much as $ 500 million. The ban on the export of food, machinery, and ships has included 15 individuals, including Li Byung-cheol, who is the chief researcher of North Korea's missile program, and the people's ability to control it. But crude oil supply froze to 4 million barrels and Kim Jong-un and Kim Yeo-jung were also exempt from sanctions. China, which has agreed to the resolution, welcomes the proposal, but has called for an early resolution of the Korean Peninsula's nuclear program, called for a peaceful and comprehensive dialogue.

According to North Jeolla Province police, the day before yesterday, they seized the phones and vehicles of aunt Jun-hee (36), her aunt (35.), and her mother, Kim (61. Police expected mobile phones and computers obtained through a search and seizure would lead to a clue to the resolution of the incident and requested a digital forensics analysis on these devices. Police say they can deduce the missing persons clues from the mobile phone records, text messages and computer searches used by her father and her mistress.Police also conducted blood tests and genetic tests on the seized homes, but did not find any meaningful evidence regarding Jun-hee's disappearance.

"" On the afternoon of July 19 in front of Noryangjin Elementary School in Seoul, where the main entrance is not even 10 meters away, examinees seemed to have gathered. A passerby was not too bothered when he took out a cigarette by the wall, and one stopped the motorcycle and smoked in front of the front door. Walls and floors near elementary schools were labeled as "" non-smoking areas, "" but they did not even pay attention.At 1:30 p.m., the junior class began to get out of the class. They began to frown when they saw adults smoking. Im Hoon, 12, a fifth grade student at the school said, "" My brothers smoke a lot in the corners of the back and back streets. "" "" I wait and see a lot of foul smell when I breathe. "" Lee Yoon-seo, 13, sixth grade, complained that he sometimes returns to avoid smoking grownups, saying, Although there are anti-smoking signs everywhere, they are not noticeable.Seoul City has specified a radius of 50 meters from the school's front and rear gates as an absolute school cleanup zone with a fine of 100,000 won for smoking. On July 12, the number of elementary schools around 18 in the jurisdiction was further expanded to stop smoking. Nevertheless, few places around schools have properly non-smoking areas. A sign reading "" No smoking area "" was displayed on the wall and on the floor near Noryangjin Elementary School in Seoul on July 19, but smokers were careless about smoking.  Adults who smoke were easily seen near performance elementary schools in Nowon-gu, Seoul. Lee Han-sol (11), a senior at the beginning of the concert, said, I felt bad for three adults on their way to school last week, and I nearly cried out, "" Please stop smoking. "" Park Gun-woong (age 13), a sixth grader, said, "" When I get cleaned up my neighborhood, I usually pick up cigarette butts "" and added, "" Two people were smoking around my school while playing basketball last weekend. ""The 2017 Smoking Survey, released last month by the Children's Welfare Foundation, found that 196 % of the nation's 16 cities and provinces saw smoking occur among children's homes and 200 surrounding education institutions. The survey revealed that all 418 children who attend school here have ' seen smoking in the streets '.Most of the people who were openly smoking near elementary schools said in unison, I did not know it was a non-smoking area. A man who was smoking in front of Noryangjin Elementary School said, What does it matter if it is in front of my house? Choi (31), a smoker, says, There are far more smoking areas than non-smoking areas. One of the examinees remained clear of regret, saying, I don`t know whether it is a non-smoking area. I only took a few steps to the nearby outdoor parking lot.Not a few people smoke in outdoor parking lots near elementary schools, in front of public prosecutors ' office, and in outdoor restaurants. In the same way, even near schools, smoking on private land was not subject to a crackdown, but was not able to stop it when cigarette smoke spread to schools.Some point out that the radius of the non-smoking area around the schools is 50 meters, so it does not include the complete education route for students.Beginning this month, we will expand the number of non-smoking areas around 18 schools in Seoul to meet the needs of students and their parents, said a city official during a campaign, adding that we will gradually increase the number of schools by conducting a trial run. Some point out that the yellow sign on the street made it easy for smokers to see the non-smoking area, he added.▽ Ahn Seung-jin, journalist of Woo-ju Seo Jae-min Talk of melting into flames on the ceiling, some of the foam which had been burned out of the roof fell into the down parking vehicle, rapidly spreading flames throughout the building, resulting in 29 deaths and 36 deaths. The roof of the sports center's parking lot was covered with an 11 mm thick styrofoam and a heat-like cloth wrapped in a vinyl house, according to the Jecheon Fire Inspection Team. The filotis have an outdoor air space on the ceiling, so they can not be heated in the winter. As a result, they are usually found to be the best pipes with the best water installed in them. To prevent this, cover the pipe with styroform and a heat insulating cloth. The pilotic ceiling of the Uijeongbu apartment building in Gyeonggi-do, which was hit hard in January 2015, also had a urethane foam treatment. The parking lot of Jecheon Sports Center also had heat-treated skin with styrofoam and heating-resistant fabric. A heated effort was made to melt pipes on the ceiling of the sports center's parking lot on the morning of July 21, when the tragedy occurred. The heat shield was used, but if the insulation tape was not properly detected at the terminals to which the power was connected, electric flames could spread. Shortly after the operation, flames started to pop from the terminal, and a fire would spread from the dust on the top 1,000. As the flammable styrofoam and thermos burn, they quickly glow over the ceiling. Then some of the burning styrofoam fell into the parking vehicle and caught fire in all 15 of the parking vehicles, as if the fire were burning in a fire in a fire furnace in an open pilotis building. When the fire department reports that the parked car was on fire, it is spreading fast, running up the inside aisles of French building attached to styrofoam and thermos.Because the fire was so big, it was hard to guess where it was fired, said a National Institute of Scientific Investigation that analyzed immediately the marks on the heated terminal to be connected to the building.The construction of the pilotis was one of the reasons why the flames immediately surrounded the entire building and developed into a major fire, as it did in the case of the Uijeongbu apartment fire. As winds and oxygen were supplied from all sides, the flames rose vertically in the freight elevator in the building and were enveloped in flames from the ground floor to the ninth floor. Right after the fire broke out, the fire flared up at the top of Jecheon Sports Center, explaining that the filotis parking lot on the first floor was the same fire as the wiring pipes. ks@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
