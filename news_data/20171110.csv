"[Hankyoreh] Lim Seon-jae (right), a weapon contract worker, met his lover Choi Seo-hyeon at the Seoul Dongdaemun History &amp; ' 26 ; Culture Park Station, where he worked late last night. Lim's work pattern, which is two shifts from day to night, makes it a great pleasure for those who find it difficult to go on a day off on weekends to see each other on subway platforms at different intervals. The train arrived at Dongdaemun History &amp; ' 26 ; Culture Park Station (Line 5). The screen door opened and people got in and out of. The conversation between the two standing against one side of the platform's pillars was drowned out by the noise, but the smiling flowers on their faces were constantly read as subtitles, "" I love you now. "" The man standing over there is screen door repair worker Lim Sun-jae. The woman standing in front of him is Choi Seo-hyeon, a civic activist for a youth group. The two have been in a relationship for four years.They promised to get married when the minimum wage is 10,000 won, but two people in a suit and wedding dress are smiling broadly in Seoul's Yeouido on April 9 when cherry blossoms were in full bloom. Last spring, the two stood in their beautiful suits and wedding dresses in the cherry blossom trees of Yeouido in Seoul. Those who participated in a campaign by a civic group to raise the minimum wage to 10,000 won stated, "" Please let us mix with the smiles of the citizens who pleaded with us to get married at the minimum wage of 10,000 won. "" Since then, the lowest wage in 2018 has been set at 7530 won. The government said it will aim for 10,000 won by 2020. Will their marriage be postponed until then? This fall I met them again and asked them casually. So when are you really going to get married? "" I was supposed to get a fully-timed job ... Im Seon-jae is fixing the screen with my colleague who moved to Chang-dong Station in Seoul on 6th. The man mumbled, "" Once the company that is in the process is finished with the switch to full-time work. "" He is a contract worker for Seoul Transportation Corporation. The Seoul Metropolitan Government hired safety management personnel to switch from sub-contractors to direct management of screen-door operations following the reverse accident of May 28 last year. In September that year, Lim and his colleagues entered the site at the sacrifice of a young man. Reports were pouring in last summer that the Seoul Metropolitan Government is planning to make about 2,400 contract workers who have invested or participated in financial institutions, including the Seoul Transportation Corporation, permanently employed by the end of this year. However, unexpected conflicts erupted in the process of specifying the method. Unlike regular workers who start with a seven-level contract, those who have switched from contract to weapon have a clue that they need to either establish an eight-class or extend the promotions by several years. If these conditions are accepted, Lim and her colleagues will have to turn over promotions even though they will have the same jobs as their juniors who will be working full-time next year. It is interpreted as a ' reasonable ' difference by some, but it is ' substantial discrimination ' by others.I can't wait to write her a honeymoon diary, but the two of them are holding hands tightly. The rough fingers don't even have the usual coupling, but the two fingers together look hard. Choi Seo-hyun's smartphone LCD that checks Facebook account of her boyfriend is damaged. They delayed repairs because of the tight living costs. Asked more about their relationship, the two replied, "" Most of the time, I have dated at the subway station on my way home or at the movie theater or sauna late at night. "" To the woman, who said, "" Starting with the monthly rent, you can have your wedding postponed until next winter. "" By then, will he become a happy full-time worker and Seo-hyeon be a winter bride like a snowflowper? As they walked to work for the night shift, the two men pressed their bare hands, with no common coupling. Seeing their back, I realized that they were asking for the time of marriage. He is already a working man who repairs screen doors for the safety of citizens, and they are companions that encourage each other's lives and walk together. The youth of those who kept their heart to love was glowing. Lee Jeong-ah, journalist, leej@hani.co.kr Seo Hae-soon, the author of the joint news agency, was sent to prosecutors on October 12 to file a lawsuit against his brother Seo Hae-soon, who is known to have committed a criminal lawsuit against prosecutors. The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency announced on July 10 that it decided that Seo was innocent of the charges of manslaughter and fraud and sent the case to the prosecution without indictment. Seo was charged with causing her daughter Seo-yeon to die on December 23, 2007 after suffering from acute pneumonia, but without proper treatment. The suspect was accused of obtaining a fraud case in which he filed a lawsuit against Kim Kwang-seok, his brother and mother at the time of Seo's death, but failed to disclose his daughter's intellectual property rights. Kim Kwang-bok, Kim`s elder brother, received the indictment against the Seoul Central District Public Prosecutors ` Office on September 21, and two days later, the metropolitan team took over the case and started an investigation. Police summonsed the accuser twice and the accused, Seo, three times. The forty-seven witnesses were questioned, including Lee Sang-ho, a news reporter who raised suspicions with Kim, paramedics who died during the accident, and doctors who treated Seo Yeon.Police confirmed that Seo had shown symptoms of a cold a few days before her death, and that Seo had taken her to the hospital and diagnosed her simple cold. Police also checked with various medical institutes and found that Seo suffered from "" Kabuki syndrome, "" a rare disorder that causes mental retardation and physical deformity, and led to acute pneumonia, which led to an acute attack by an immune system specialist. Seo stated that he had given emergency measures such as artificial respiration, autopsy reports showed that he died of lung disease, and when he reached the conclusion that there was no intended evidence of only cold medicine in his blood, Seo said.Seo Hae-soon, who attended the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency on October 12. [Yonhap news agency] Police also denied that Seo Kwang-seok's brother was involved in an intellectual property infringement suit, and said, "" Seo Yeon-seok died in the middle of a suit. "" Kim Kwang-seok gave away all rights to his music works during his lifetime, and when Seo died in 1996, he would claim the rights of heirs, ' my father said. Kim`s elder brother and his mother filed a suit to confirm intellectual property rights, claiming that they had a will to cancel the agreement with his daughter-in-law. Seo lost some of the cases in the first and second trial, but the Supreme Court reversed the ruling in 2008 to say that all rights are with Miss Seo.The Seoul High Court, which has decided to close the case, approved the program in October 2008. His brother insists that Seo's fraud charges were made in 2008 because he didn`t know that Seo-yeon had died already, he said. However, the police judged that Seo had no obligation to notify the court of her death under the civil suit law and the Supreme Court precedent because her lawyer was appointed at the time of her death. Kim Kwang-bok's request to let her use the original sound for free during a non-profit-published memorial concert, and the survival of Seo was never ruled out in the lawsuit. Seo, who was questioned about whether he left his daughter to die for her financial gains, cleared Kim Kwang-bok and Lee Sang-ho of defamation in the near future as he cleared them of charges through police investigation. Seo's lawyer Park Hoon said on Facebook yesterday, I have called for the unreasonable claims of Kim Kwang-bok to be made by reporter Lee Sang-ho as a serial killer who requested Lee to be released without verification.

"Photo : The time when people raise pets in one house after another. As the pet market grows, the costs of animal lovers increase, but some argue that institutional repair is needed because there is no uniform standards.In particular, since there is no clear standard, the cost can vary up to eight times depending on animal hospitals, even though it is the same treatment and treatment. Choi (59), who lives in Incheon, goes out every year to get a vaccine against dogs. Choi said, "" There is an animal hospital near my home, but I visit an animal hospital in another town because it is too expensive to pay. "" Soon, the doctor said, "" I don't know the standard of cost. "" Hospitals offer various vaccines, but the costs are too high, he said, adding, I feel sorry for dogs in the reality of having to worry about money first. Eight out of 10 partners should unify the pet hospital expenses policy = According to a report released in July by the New Jersey KB Financial Holding Management Institute, the "" 2007 Animals Returning Policy "" has turned out to be eight people who have been responding to animal care costs. The survey was conducted May 23-26 on the mobile survey of 1,500 men and women aged 15 and over who use KB Card nationwide.Asked about the animal-related system, 80.6 percent answered, "" We should unify animal hospital expenses policy. "" 88.7 percent answered that they would like to increase the penalty for handling animal waste, and 86.0 percent said they should increase the level of punishment for animal waste and cruelty. The survey also found that 6 out of 10 people who spend the most money on animal welfare found that they spent the most on childcare expenses for diseases and injuries (64.0 %). In addition, 58.9 percent of preventive spending (mostly spent on vaccines and medicine for heartwork) were found to be high.KB Financial Holding Management Research Institute (KB-Service) recently conducted a survey to ask its partners to improve the medical expenses of pets, and they are finding out that they have high costs and preventive costs.What is the real difference between the cost of hospital and the cost of hospital …According to the National Consumer Education Association of division, the maximum expense for vaccination costs of 25 animal hospitals in Incheon, Daejeon, Gwangju, Ulsan, Daegu and Busan in January was eight times higher than that of other cities. It was discovered that the price difference is extreme depending on the hospital.PHOTOS : According to research conducted by KB Financial Holding Management Institute, the initial cost is 6.67 times higher than the minimum cost of 3,000 won to the maximum of 20,000 won. Re-producing costs are also at least 3,000 won and up to 16,000 won, which makes the gap 5.33 times higher. The cost of tests was five times higher than normal blood tests and X-rays, respectively, and abdominal ultrasonography showed a four fold difference.As for vaccination costs, the price difference between the highest and lowest prices was five times smaller and eight times higher.

A number of pet insurance plans that insurance companies neglect to pay for hospitals have been released, but the majority of insurance companies have withdrawn from the insurance market due to high losses.Insurance companies say they can not estimate the cost of medical treatment they would pay, such as a double claim from insurance holders or an excess of animal hospitals and fake treatment because the cost of pet hospitals is not standardized.According to the Korea Insurance Institute, the insurance coverage agency, which was first introduced in 2007, was extended with the implementation of a revision to the animal protection law in 2008. However, the insurance industry stopped selling most insurance products due to deteriorating loss. Then, the animal registration system was enforced in 2014, and insurance companies began to re-issue their pets. However, only three insurance companies sell pet insurance policies, including Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance, Lotte Insurance, and Hyundai Marine & Marine Insurance, are currently operating at a low level.▽ Photo = The level of Korean purchase of pets insurance is also very low.According to the KIRI's report on the "" Challenge to Promote Return-Insurance Insurance "", insurance coverage rates in the UK, Germany and the United States is very low at 0.1 % and 2 %, respectively.As of March 2017, the insurance industry as a whole has around 2,000 contracts, but it is very small compared to the country`s total size of more than 8 million dogs and cats.What is the reason for the poor sign up for animal insurance? The partners say they feel the need to buy insurance, but avoid it due to high subscription standards and inadequate benefits.Photo : "" Products released on the market need to be updated every year with full guarantees, "" according to the New York Institute of Technology. In addition, the maximum limit for new subscribers is mostly 6 or 7 years old. Even if dogs are registered before age seven, they can not be guaranteed when they age because their ability to renew is limited to 11 or 12 years old. The targets of subscription are dogs and cats only.In particular, vaccination or neutralization surgeries, which are necessary for pets, are not guaranteed. That is why the partners think insurance products are inefficient. Animal care standards : "" I want to pay my pet treatment fee "" and "" I want to pay my pet doctor's fee "" because they have no uniform standards, which makes them more expensive to treat and treat.In 1999, Korea Insurance Research Institute decided to use standard medical care fees as a prearrangement, and scrapped the veterinary fee system to reduce medical bills through autonomous competition. Animal hospitals are now deciding on the cost of treatment and each hospital can not afford to pay the cost of treatment based on the cost of human health. Though the government intended to expand the consumers ' choice by introducing an autonomous competition system, the people of the U.S. are suffering from high prices and arbitrary medical bills. As a result, many people are calling for the introduction of the medical standards system for animals.Last August, the Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry held an open discussion to introduce a standard price system for animal care, recognizing the need for price tags.The citizens who participated in the debate said, "" If the system is established, people can avoid excessive treatment and pay health care.In Germany, the cost of care is standardized by law. The German government has set a lower limit on medical bills, which prevents doctors from receiving more than three times the lower limit. Although there is no legal regulation in the U.S., the American Hospital Association provides basic information such as the average cost of treatment to determine by consumers.The government, a companion animal health, a number naerinda a companion animal medical decision by the end of the first an inspection by the main concern is Moon Jae-in, a number. The government has also decided to actively review the ' animal-related medical fee ' as an alternative to lowering animal hospital costs.The decision on whether to introduce a price system for pet doctors is expected to be concluded by the end of this year. Hong Nam-gi, head of the Presidential Office for Government Policy Coordination, told the National Assembly's parliamentary political affairs committee on December 12 that the number of standards entrusted by the Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry will be determined based on whether or not to comply with the plan in December. We don`t have to ask people to take up the public arena anymore, saying, It is not the public's call that pet health care costs are too high and that animal hospitals have drastically different medical bills.

(local time) United States (wsj) Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, according to the United States and China has cards in president's visit to the energy sector, including parts, aircraft, itA trade pact, more than $ 250 billion investment. The U.S. government the maximum size of the history of economic cooperation between countries and to stress that Trump as the president's, this astronomical public (對中) to reduce the trade deficit.That the number of end of this year. However, the WSJ pointed out that the U.S. business community is skeptical that the investment will be carried out in practice, as most of the agreements are renegotiated or the MOU is not binding. Bloomberg also quoted a participant of the treaty as saying that the package containing China's list of purchases to the United States from items such as airplanes, energy, agricultural products, and life sciences is "" for show. "" First of all, China`s plan to invest $ 83.7 billion (94 trillion won) directly in China's energy investment, recorded as the biggest deal in the deal, is no different from the "" brilliant escape. ""The state-run China Energy Investment Corporation has signed a preliminary agreement to invest in Shale Gas and Chemical Products in West Virginia, U.S. However, since American companies do not participate in the contract and the investment period is 20 years, it raises a question whether it will help the U.S. economy. The Alaska Gas Development Project, which will have a derivatives investment of up to $ 43 billion (49 trillion won), is one of the biggest economic cooperation items, but it is not new in terms of the deal being negotiated between the U.S. and China. Moreover, Beijing has only expressed an interest in possible LNG purchases made in a joint statement. China Oil Chemical Group (Jinhua and Sinopec) and Alaska Gas Line Development Corporation (AGDC) entered into an agreement with China Investment Limited. From 2024-2025, the president of Alaska Gas Lines (AGDC) developed by However, as the final agreement with Sinopec is scheduled for next year, it is not likely that the project will be implemented in the near future. `` The deal is political but not binding, and Sinopec is likely to break it, '' said analyst Hugo Brenner of Berrick Maple Croft. The China Air Transport and Drug Administration (CASHC) announced that it would buy 300 planes worth 37 billion U.S. dollars (41 trillion won) from Boeing, an airline company in the industry is also seeing them as a conspiracy. According to aviation expert Flight Global, Boeing has already received an order of 1,000 aircraft from an unidentified buyer, and the industry estimates most of its purchase demand is from China. As a result, the industry agrees that the latest contract is nothing new. Boeing has actively utilized the political event to promote its company, including the announcement of its orders for 38 billion dollars worth of airplanes when President Xi Jinping visited the U.S. in 2015. Chaomi Opo, a Chinese mobile phone maker, announced a three-year deal worth $ 12 trillion ($ 12 billion) with U.S. semiconductor maker Qualcomm. However, the agreement is not binding and the purchase size itself is similar to the sum of all current orders of the three companies, sources told WSJ. Experts say a Trump deal may not be as well as to reduce the trade deficit at all, unlike the United States president's intention will not help the economy.Agreed. China is encouraging foreign companies to produce in China through "" Made in China 2025 "" to boost its manufacturing industry, and this investment trade agreement has been formulated to prevent the Chinese economy from interpreting its trade strategy. James McGregor, director of the Chinese office of international consulting firm APCO Worldwide, said, "" Getting all the deals together and making a big deal out of it all started to develop our outdated relationship. "" And China have a powerful economies (trade deficit will be cut to expect that), naive and destructive industrial policy in the United States now.And ""saying"" shows Trump president of the deal done for show. "" added. Former ambassador Max Bauchus also insisted, "" It is a classic form of deception by China for thousands of years, and every ceremony includes a few moments of conspicuous consumption by which the Chinese can avoid serious dialogue. "" Therefore, the industry's dominant view is that a fundamental shift in China's trade policies is needed rather than such a temporary agreement to solve the growing public trade deficit. Jacob Parker, vice president of the American and Chinese Business Association in Beijing, believes the agreement is good, but that it is more urgent to remove the barriers to access the Chinese market. He was forced to transfer technology to the Chinese market or he could not obtain 100 percent of control, so he said, "" What the industry needs most is what the second largest economy in the world, China, so that it is easier to reach.

In the photo, the government of Geumgang Kongjubo in South Chungcheong Province and Kim Seong-tae in North Chungcheong Province decided to open the gates of 14 out of the 16 rivers including the Han River and Nakdong River starting July 13. Among them, five structures including Geumgang Sejongbo will open their sluice gates to reduce the water level to the lowest level. In particular, as five of the Geumgang and Yeongsan Rivers and the Nakdonggang River will remain open even after the farming season begins next year, it is feared that agricultural water supply will be disrupted. The Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Transport held a joint briefing at the Sejong Center for the Performing Arts on July 10 to monitor the four major rivers to determine their impact on water quality. The government has been investigating the prevention of algae and opening effects of water sources since June, and began to visit the 6-strong section of the Nakdonggang River, Goryeong Bo, Dalseongbo, Changnyeongbo, and Geumgang Gongjubo. It was reported that the water was released to the six major rivers in early July, but it did not work. Kang Chan-su, however, has been criticized for having opened partially to the public, so it was not enough to prevent algae from rising in the sea and monitor changes in the water and aquatic ecosystem. According to the plan that the government announced on the same day, the opening of the sluice gates to the Nakdonggang River was not a problem when water supply was not available, and the opening of the gate to the Nakdonggang River was possible and temporary measures were possible on July 13. The five groups want to keep the water gates fully open and to maintain the flow of the river to the level before the construction of the dam. The water level will be gradually lowered by lowering the water intake by 2-3 cm per hour to minimize the impact on residents and the aquatic ecosystem. The river will also be opened to the maximum level of water intake from the Nakdonggang River, where the drinking water area is located, and from the Yeongsangang River, Juksanbo, which will be opened to the lowest level. The two groups will also start opening on July 13. Water intake level or the lower limit level is the lowest level that does not interfere with the intake. Graphic : Kim Joo-won, a reporter at the Ministry of Data and Environment, will reduce the water level by 2-8.2 meters, depending on the gate opening plans for the four rivers. The government will also determine when to open the gate and water, considering the supply of seven water items, including the two pillars of the Han River and six steps upstream of the Nakdonggang River. The Han River, whose water quality is relatively high, and the Han River, Kyungcheon and Yeoju beams were excluded from the opening. As a result, 14 out of 16 rivers will be opened, and seven of them will be lowered to 2-8.2 meters from the current level. The government is planning to maintain the open position even after the farming season begins next year, with the government pushing ahead with a temporary water supply plan to provide six water out of seven temporary measures to open the market to the Nakdonggang River. The other eight reports, including the ones from the Cheonan, are scheduled to be raised to the level that enables agricultural water use by the end of March next year. The scenario of opening sluice gates to Nakdong River. Both Changnyeongbo and Haman Bay are planning to recover their water levels before the season begins next spring. The government plans to monitor water quality, ground water level changes and stream erosion that emerged during the opening of the gate to prepare basic measures to deal with each of the four rivers in the future. The presidential office told a joint committee of the government and private sector in May that it would decide to deal with the four rivers by the end of next year. The government is also expected to monitor the effectiveness and impact of the stream's erosion, safety of its structure, and opening of its river bed and sediment, in addition to the monitoring concerning water quality, algae, water production, repair, sluice water, and groundwater. Meanwhile, concerns have been raised over the opening of the gate. If the water level falls due to the opening of the gate, it could disrupt the supply of agricultural water during the farming season next year. Water intake for living and industrial use may also be problematic. In addition, the waterfront facilities in Nakdong River, including water boats, are expected to resist opening their gates. The government says that lower water levels will have less impact in winter due to low demand for agricultural water and water-wet activities. However, it was confirmed that 25 out of 77 water intake facilities among the six companies that will continue to operate after the season of farming next year need temporary measures. The government has decided that temporary underwater pumps will be installed in rivers to pump water into temporary water tanks for these facilities, and that when taken back from temporary water tanks, there would be little problem in supplying water. The temporary construction is scheduled to start sometime this month and complete by March next year.

The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, which has been investigating the case, announced the results of its investigation and sent Seo to the prosecution without any evidence of any criminal charges of manslaughter or fraud. Seo, who was cleared of charges during the police investigation, not only grilled Kim Kwang-seok, his brother Kim Kwang-seok, who filed a lawsuit against him, but also complained to Rep. However, Kim Kwang-bok and Lee's reporter said they still have doubts regarding the incident, so the storm is likely to get stronger after the incident.Seo-hae-soon Kim, wife of the late Kwang-seok and Kim In-cheol, a reporter at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, announced yesterday that Park Chang-hwan, chief of the 2nd metropolitan investigation team, was guilty of charges of manslaughter regarding the last singer's death. 2017.11.10yatoya@yna.co.kr( ended with a conclusion that the police, Seo Hae-soon, do the best for the daughter, concluded that Seo had not "" the best evidence to kill her when she intentionally did so. "" Police first investigated the situation on December 23, 2007 when Seo Yeon passed away. She also looked at how Seo took care of her daughter five days before she showed symptoms of a cold. Seo and his housemates suddenly collapsed at 5 a.m. when Miss Seo-yeon "" called for water "" and suddenly called in the warm water at 119 a.m., according to police. Seo was also reported to have given emergency measures such as artificial respiration to Seo Yeon. Police explained Seo appeared to have been so absorbed in nursing that she had no credit card detail from December 18 to the day of her death when she began to feel sick. The police also confirmed that Seo did not neglect her daughter before she was sick, and that her friends, teachers, and neighbors paid extra attention to her. The results of the study showed that Seo's daughter was left unattended. Rather, the school teacher confirmed that what Seo-yeon wrote was right, adding, "" I had a funny fight with my mom, "" and the police also confirmed friendly text messages between the two. "" Seo attended school every day, even though it was about 20 kilometers from his home to Yeon-yang's school, "" police officials said. "" He visited German hospitals to treat the rare illnesses that Seo-yeon had, "" and "" Kabuki syndrome, "" in the United States is also famous. It was also not revealed that Kim Kwang-bok agreed during the final arbitration agreement on the 2008 copyright lawsuit, that Seo claimed that "" Seo needed the rights to raise the children. "" When I look back on the first investigation, Seo claimed that Seo-yeon needed to have copyright rights to raise, which was pre-death, police said. At the time, the lawyer who represented the lawsuit said the same thing. In addition, the police automatically succeeded Seo as the sole heir after her death, and the court and the other party explained to the court that Seo had not died according to the civil procedure law and the Supreme Court precedent.

"" I will take proper legal action against the journalist, together with the brainwasher lawmakers and the media within the next week, "" he said, referring to Lee`s unreasonable remarks as a serial killer. Seo's massive counterattack kept Kim and Lee from backing down. They said they would not doubt the death of Seo Yeon and Kim Kwang-seok. She said in the entrance door, "" I'm glad Seo-yeon is slightly relieved of the suspicion of death, "" adding, "" If it were an acute pneumonia, I would have had a lot of fever and difficulty in breathing, "" adding, "" I would not have been able to give her any medicine yet.

"▽ Traditional market and university business cards without registration number of business cards = Extraction of Park Gu into Asian economy and interest-free loans = 826 cases of fake money such as sunshine money were found in the Korean traditional market. Some of the funds were even quoted as a table with the amount due on a daily basis.Over 20 ads by loan companies were found in the market for about 20 minutes. However, most of the ads, which were put under the logo of the Fair Trade Commission, were confirmed to be unregistered illegal lenders. Only one ad by the registered company with registration number and business license number was posted.Lenders with business cards were also found in various areas near a university in Anyang, Gyeonggi Province, with no sign of interest-free loans if they were to be paid in a month, but they also registered illegally. I see a loan advertisement almost every day on the roadside, said a 23-year-old university student, I don't think so, but if I suddenly need money, I would think so.Illegal loans are on the rise again, squeezing high blood out of the murderous interest rate on needy people who need a quick payment.According to the National Police Agency on July 10, the number of violations of the "" Act on Registration of Loan and Protection of Financial Users "" was again on the decline from 1259 cases in 2014 to 781 in 2015. This year, 826 cases were detected in January and August alone, exceeding last year's levels. Police in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province recently arrested an unregistered loan company that applied an annual rate of at least 17.83 percent to 3,176 percent.The problem is that the illegal loans are aimed at the financial underdogs, including the low-income bracket who need a quick supply. In particular, non-registered lenders are routinely exposing illegal loans by distributing business cards to traditional markets and residential areas, as well as sending spam text messages and e-mails. In fact, the Korea Communications Commission released 346,222 illegally borrowed spam text messages in the first half of this year. At an average daily rate of 1920, it is estimated to be larger if it includes uncategorized or uncollected spam.In addition, illegal businesses are pretending to be legal. Article 9 of the Act provides for advertisement by all loan service operators, such as business cards, business name or representative, registration number of mortgage brokerage firms, lending rate and overdue interest, and excessive debt payment periods.However, they stress the easy and easy lending process without the registration number, while simply writing down the phrase "" registered companies. "" It even packages up the trademark to a reliable loan company, using the trademark of the Fair Trade Commission and post office. Recently, it is disguised as a working class bank by using similar names such as sunbean and microfinance. The ads are placed in areas with relatively ' financial underdogs ' such as traditional markets, college-style studio apartments and residential areas. One former employee, who worked for an unregistered loan company, said, "" I ride my motorcycle and throw business cards around the streets, but I've also been told to hit the streets in a neighborhood where many luxury apartments are difficult to sell. ""If an urgent request is needed, we should first tap the door of the Korea Workers ` Compensation and Welfare Service to see if it is desirable to ask for counseling about the products of the working class, said an official at the Financial Supervisory Service.Lee Kwan-ju, reporter of the Korea Development Institute, Jeong Joon-young, labrie@asiae.co.kr kimsdoo@yna.co.kr : As the Unification Ministry said, "" The government is to blame for the abrupt change in policy, "" the total amount of Lee Jeong-jin, the company's resident at the Gaesong Industrial Complex, will be increased to 583.3 billion won. Government support is also provided for the first time to cope with the damages caused by the suspension of tours to the South and North Korean businesses to Mt. Kumgang in 2010 and 2008. The government announced its plan to support enterprises and economic cooperation businesses in the Gaesong Industrial Complex after consultations with related ministries, including the Unification Ministry on July 10. The measure was taken to ensure the nation is in charge of businesses suffering unexpected management difficulties due to the government`s abrupt change in policies, the ministry said. The government has decided to stop the Gaesong Industrial Complex in response to North Korea's fourth nuclear test last February, and has so far decided to provide 543.3 billion won in aid to companies that moved in and executed it. The ministry said the damages were 65.8 percent of the damages identified by the government following a fact-finding survey (786.1 billion won), and that when the additional funds were provided, the Unification Ministry explained that it would account for 74.2 percent of the damages. Additional support is concentrated on damages to liquid assets such as finished products and raw materials.Government, Gaesong Industrial Complex and economic cooperation support (PG) [Production Manager] and composite photo compensation standards will be extended from 70 % to 2.2 billion won in damages to 159 % and 7 billion won in damages. As liquid assets are directly linked to the damages of many small suppliers, it is essential to normalize operations and provide extra support, a ministry official explained. Additional 144 billion won will be provided for damages to investment assets such as land and factories. For damages on non-insurable assets, 36 companies will receive 9.5 billion won in damages, and expanding the support of rental assets will receive 4.9 billion won in each of 43 companies. In both cases, the limit is 45 percent to 3.5 billion won. Additional aid will be granted by the Inter-Korean Exchange and Cooperation Promotion Committee during this month.It is the last time we have to pay the subsidy, said an official at the Unification Ministry.[Graphic] The government will provide businesses in the Gaesong Industrial Complex with additional support of 5,240 trillion won and for the first time receiving damage from the suspension of tours to Mt. Kumgang. Unlike companies at the Gaesong Industrial Complex, economic cooperation businesses only provided three special loans and one emergency fund to them, but they did not receive any direct damage from the incident. The May 24, 2010 response to North Korea`s sinking of a South Korean warship Cheonan banned inter-Korean trade, causing damage to South Korean companies engaged in inter-Korean business, such as clothing and rental work, outside the Gaeseong Industrial Complex. In the wake of the killing of tourist Park Wang-ja, the South Korean government suspended tours to Mt. Kumgang in 2008, hurting not only Hyundai Asan, the South Korean business operator, but also local restaurants. We should investigate the situation, but we estimate about 900 of the 1,000 businesses that will be supported by the project are under consideration. The criteria for support to asset damages are identical to those of companies who have not been insured in the Gaesong Industrial Complex, where damages shall be paid from KRW 5 million to KRW 40 million per company depending on their previous investment or transaction performance. The government will provide support to the victims next January or February after investigating the damages.

Friday, Friday observed stories of Dutch parriers who manage their own money, from newlyweds to middle-aged, single parents to working couples.Two out of ten couples "" combined with income of some or independently controlled by one "" or "" Marriage is a dessert, "" said American historian Stephanie Kunz in his book, "" A evolving marriage. "" In the past, marriage was a ' must have ' menu for men and women who could not afford to live independently, but it is just a ' dessert ' for modern people who live alone enough.Desserts are something you can choose if you want to eat, or skip if you don't want to. As soon as a wedding becomes a ' choice, ' the relationship changes. Kunz says the relationship is shifting from being "" subordinate "" to being a self independent relationship between an imperfect couple sharing everything and being able to depend on each other.The evidence is that in the report of the Gender Equality and Family Survey of 2016, the results of the remaining 4884 couples across the country were either combined or two percent of married couples were found to be in the same survey (which was published in March). The ratio of working couples to manage their own money was higher. According to a survey of working couples 2385, on average 3 pairs (31.6 %) of incomes have to be combined on a single income basis with some of the income being ' broken down by the household ' and ' the rest are managed individually '. Instead, the Dutch pay trend has become the one in which men and women pay for their weddings. We looked at the new married formula that emerged as the marriage changed from a ' must-have ' to a ' dessert. 'Love and War … The answer is Dutch pay couple Lee Hee-kyung (40), an hagwon instructor in Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul, had a non-prize-wielding fight with her husband. Not long ago, I overheard my husband's smartphone called Kakao Talk's ‘ Check Out The Non-priced Account. ’ A message from a co-worker to settle the price of alcohol stirred up a fight. "" And I was angry with him, but I actually got it. I have often spent my late nights without telling my husband. Both of them were over 40 years old, and I felt sorry about reporting each other's card details to the public. And they should be able to put together the money they need, rather the money they need for their lives, and put aside the money they need to spend or the money they need to pay for their own lives. "" Experts say, "" A key economic contributor is the Dutch pay rise in status of women. "" Unlike the past, most women have the ability to earn more or more money at any time, "" said Yoon Sang-cheol, a sociology professor at the University of Han, adding, "" The number of women in the family has increased. ""Dual-income couples are not the only ones who are living in Dutch. Lee Ji-young (31), an eight-year-old stay-at-home mom in Ulsan, became a Dutch husband after arguing with her husband two years ago. Woo has not made any regular income, but has declared that her husband must pay for her family expenses and childcare. As a result, he gets 500,000 won monthly. Woo said, "" I was sick and tired of having to ask my husband for permission to buy a suit worth 30,000 won. "" "" It's not a lot of money, but I have half a million won in pocket money. ""The Korea Institute for Women Policy Studies, a survey of the average stay-at-home mom's daily wage was 37.1 million won, according to a calculation made by the Korea Institute for Housing Workers ` Compensation and Welfare on the basis of salary for their eight-year-old daughter and three-year-old sons. Female housework is considered to be a financial value, and a single Dutch pay couple will appear. The pension funds and their children's allowances will be deducted from their monthly payments and they will share the money equally. Choi said, "" Classical and baduk were initially incompatible with the former woman's husband, "" adding, "" In my home I've had more than 30 years to live, it's hard to tell my husband to bridge the gap by spending more time at school. ""French futurist Févienne Gubodiment says, "" The average lifespan is increasing, and the marriage system is changing completely. "" The current marriage system is a mismatch for middle-aged couples over the age of 50, as human beings were set up to live up for 50. In fact, 30.4 percent of 103,300 couples divorced last year were married 20 years or more.Older people who are tired of sharing their lives together live the Dutch pay couple, who only manage their own money. According to the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family survey, more than one (12.0 %) of couples aged 60 or older combined some of their income out of every 10, while the rest were either managing separately or managing separately.There is a growing consensus that each person should prepare for his or her own retirement. According to a survey of 7339 men and women by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, the percentage of retirement preparation plans (redundant responses) was 76.4 % higher than that of ' saving their own property or preparing their own jobs for retirement '.The changing tendency of going Dutch to bed and getting married is also contributing to the increase of the Dutch pay couple. Kim Dong-hwan (28), who is about to get married next year, says, "" Of course, my girlfriend who worked for a large company four years ago made a lot of money first, and I don't have to pay much more for my marriage. ""According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, 73.9 percent of the respondents said dating should be "" equally costly. "" As a result, the cost of housing for men, women, and children should be equally assessed as if they were "" given homes. "" (85.1 %)Lim Young-jin, a psychology professor at Taegu University in Seoul, said, "" Having habits that have not been financially dependent on each other since their relationship can lead to marriage. "" "" Having separate pockets for each other, while keeping a separate purse in the middle, is important. ""Now, many people are pessimistic about the old saying, "" Dutch pay "", "" It is a deterioration of the meaning of marriage. "" Nam Min-jae (28), who runs a pool hall in Busan, said, "" It looks like the Dutch pay team is ready to part in the end. "" "" Let's move away from our wives and money when we talk about it. "" Kim Ok-hee (68), who has been managing her husband's income ever since marriage, said, "" If we share our economic circumstances and plan our future together, why not for marriage? ""Economic science professor Sung Tae-yoon at Yonsei University said, "" Dutch divorced couples are as if they were individually developed countries.

Kang Bu-young, a judge of the Seoul Central District Court, revealed on July 10 that he would reject the arrest warrant for Kim, who was called for his arrest on for violating the National Intelligence Service Law. Regarding the reason for the dismissal, the judge said, We have gathered most evidence of fact, and there is little concern about running away in light of the job and residence of the accused. "" The violation of the NIS law, which is a major charge, is to punish the NIS employees ' misconduct, "" he said. "" If the unqualified suspect is absent, he or she must argue with us over whether or not she should have been involved or not. "" Prosecutors requested an arrest warrant for Kim on charges of illegally engaging in broadcasting production in 2011 with NIS officials. Prosecutors judged that Kim had accepted the roadmap presented in the normalization strategies and measures for MBC, which was created in collusion with NIS officials. Prosecutors suspect Kim led a series of government critical-based programs, including the PD Diary, in which he led the replacement of production teams, producers and cast members, and suspension of production. Prosecutors also said Kim gave unreasonable instruction to members of MBC's Employee and Media Workers ' Union to train them, and accused the union of conducting an intervention in management. Kim denies the accusations. During a prosecution hearing on July 6 as a suspect, he argued to reporters, MBC is a company that can`t take control of broadcasting networks, and as a president, there has been no communication with the NIS or Cheong Wa Dae. When he came to court for questioning, Kim told reporters, "" I think it's best to say what you have to say, even if it's hard enough, I can't take control of the company.

Prosecutors launched a forced investigation into the case on July 30 by searching the residences of three then MBC executives, including former Chairman Kim, Vice President Baek Jong-moon, and former Planning and Coordination Director Jeon Young-bae. The NIS employees and the Korean Broadcasting Commission's office, which was in charge of MBC at the time, were also included in the search and seizure. pyo000@newsis.com>"
"A social gathering is a place where people gather to eat and socialize. However, it also causes many accidents. The controversy over the sexual assault between Hansaem and Hyundai Card also started at the party. The Dong-A Ilbo's team heard the story of 10 working women who were sexually harassed or sexually assaulted at a dinner party on July 9. It was revealed that the ` drinking parties `, the typical course of dining, and ` singing room ` and ` returning to home ` were all exposed to the danger of sexual violence. Women pleaded for ` company dinner phobia, ` saying the dining room had turned into a scene of sexual violence by abusing the working relationships between the upper and lower levels. A (26, female) who has just joined a construction company gets cold feet when he thinks of a social gathering before an in-house athletic event. The male boss said, "" If you only dance in panties, are you sure about the cheer award? "" And his men chuckled. She went out alone to weep. Due to constant harassment, Mr. A resigned in September.A non-regular worker at a large company affiliated company was forced to kiss her when she went to a dinner party hosted by the head of the personnel department in March. A woman in her 20s was under a lot of stress because her boss described her bed with her wife at every diner. She has alopecia areatorily and has recently resigned. When she met a client, she would talk about her figure and sexually molest her. All he could say was "" Praise for the woman. "" In a karaoke booth that frequently goes to parties, sexual harassment is made public under the guise of friendship. It is not uncommon for female employees to ask them to pour alcohol or dance, and cover their waists under the guise of "" disco. "" We treat her as a karaoke helper or a hospitality woman. A woman in her 20s said, When my boss opened her arms toward me every time she finished singing, I would be forced to give in to make up. After having dinner, the trail is full of sexual harassment. The man's boss says, "" Since night roads are dangerous, I'll take you home. "" We're forced into a taxi together. I've always loved it before "". Women who are molested suffer from double hardships, worrying that they will be disadvantaged in the company. A woman who joined a small five-person company stopped the company's CEO from sexually molesting in a taxi on her way home. After that, even if he was late 15 minutes, he was harassed, including a pay cut. As the warning about sexual harassment at work increases, the number of sexual harassment cases is increasing. "" I don't make any sexual harassment remarks, "" he said. "" △△ has a good figure when you see him. "" "" If the listener is ashamed of something, it is sexual harassment, "" asks the listener, "" the person is so twisted. "" In addition, if a workplace raises the issue of sexual violence, they are often branded as "" problematic employees, "" which results in secondary damage. Companies often try to cover up problems and ask for an agreement. According to the National Police Agency, the number of sexual assault cases at work has increased from 358 in 2012 to 721 last year. Sexual harassment is considered an insult under the current law, so the level of punishment is like a fine of hundreds of thousands of won. The accused man also sued the victim for defamation and led her into a muddy fight. All 10 women reporters who met should not start by forcing a young female employee to sit next to her male boss at a dinner.Cho Dong-ju, reporter of Gupyeonggyo, and Kim Ye-yoon ; Facebook, the only newspaper company in Dongah Ilbo, and Wolteok Ilbo, all hot economic issues and methods for redeploying cars are banned from being illegally redistributed and redisted by Dong-A Ilbo & Donga.com ▽ Incheon Transportation Commission-The recent series of accidents on the completion of the "" Daeseok Park "" facility construction project in June 2010 that resulted in the destruction of the "" Daeseok Park "" facility on July 13. As no one else has offered to run the facility, taxpayers ' money, which is close to 100 billion won, is likely to be buried. Incheon Transportation Corporation announced on July 10 that it had been suspended twice recently in a bid to purchase and install a new WolmI Galaxy Railtrack system. Although it is in the process of bidding for the third time by June 13, no one has actively expressed their willingness to participate in the project. The Korea Transportation Corporation said, "" If a proper operator does not appear before the deadline, we can consider taking down the existing facilities altogether. "" ◇ First button inserted into the wrong direction = The WolmI Galaxy Railways were originally planned to run around WolmI Park on Subway Line No. 1 from Incheon to Incheon City. However, the project was pushed ahead by shifting to an orbital train 6-17 meters above ground when the project was changed to symbolize the Incheon International City Festival held in Songdo in 2009. Eventually, the WolmI Galaxy Rail, which costs 85.3 billion won to complete the facility in June 2010, was closed down due to a series of trial runs. All rail and car except the bridge and the top of the bridge were removed last year. Incheon Transportation Corporation, the owner of the project, only reaped 5.4 billion won of the 27.2 billion won (27.2 million U.S. million U.S. dollars) in damages suits it filed earlier this year against nine construction companies, including Hanshin Corporation. However, when financial expenses and administrative expenses were added together, taxpayers ' money was wasted. Incheon city tried to introduce a touring rail bike with closed WolmI Galaxy Railways in 2013 through a public recruitment drive and public opinion poll, but it changed to a monorail with a sixth-phase private railroad. Even so, small monorail that was due to be opened in May has been thrown out of business again and is in litigation with a company.Wolmido is still a popular dating spot among young lovers on weekends. However, as the two levels of the WolmI Galaxy Railways set off from the ocean view, the number of customers visiting sea cafes decreased dramatically. However, Incheon Metropolitan Government and the Incheon Transit Authority are ready to maintain whatever facility was left unattended for more than seven years. It plans to spend an additional 18 billion won to keep existing business expenses from being buried, and install a new track vehicle on the WolmI Galaxy Railways by 2019. However, none of the companies participated in the first or second project proposal contest, so the company is bidding for the third time until July 13. It would cost tens of billions of won to dismantle the already completed WalmI Galaxy rail bridges and four stations, officials said, adding that the best way to open up the facilities would be to ensure stable rail links. Some argue, however, that it would result in bigger losses if the government spares sunk costs that can not be recovered, and that a social consensus process is needed, including the removal of the entire WolmI Galaxy Railways. Concerns are growing that if the government forces a monorail business that has no business potential, it could incur bigger losses to compensate for the resulting losses. Incheon Peace and Welfare Association official Lee Kwang-ho said, We need to agree on whether to let the facilities remain as a lesson of wasting taxpayers ` money or take them down to explore other projects.

"You must have had this conversation once during drinking. There are many myths about alcohol and dieting. But most of the time, they don't get to the conclusion of what's right. Today SBS Life summarized what is true of the various myths surrounding "" alcohol "" and "" fat "" in an interview with Professor Kim Sang-hyeok at Bundang Seoul National University's Hospital's School of Family Medicine.Alcohol has no calories?… it's not true to say that there are no calories in a calorie bomb. Alcohol, the main ingredient of alcohol, has a calorie content of 7 kcal per gram. While you can feel a few calories if you look at the number of 7 kcal, it is nearly twice as high as carbohydrates or protein that has 4 kcal per gram. In fact, the average calorie of a bottle of soju is 343 kcal.Alcohol, the main ingredient of A drink, is a high-calorie food with 7 kcal per gram. It depends on the alcohol content, but usually a bottle of soju has more than 300 kcal and a glass of beer 500 mL has about 200 kcal. But even though it is high in calories, alcohol does not have the nutritional needs of our bodies. It is not called empty calories because it is low in calories, but because it has higher calories, it is called empty calories or empty calories.How about alcoholic patients?… Actually, it is a myth that alcohol does not gain weight when it is taken in fat-dissipating technique. Alcohol can actually prevent fat from being burned and cause obesity. Drinking can cause the blood vessels to expand and even cause heat in the body. Some people think it's a sign of energy consumption, but it's really just a little tipsy.In our body, metabolic activities take place to maintain physical balance. But when you drink alcohol, your body delays the metabolic activity to break down toxins in alcohol. Alcohol can not promote the consumption of energy in the body, but it can even interfere with the breakdown of fats.If you go to the scale the day after you drink, you may lose weight. Losing weight is most likely due to transient dehydration. Alcohol is broken down into acetaldehyde by the breakdown enzymes in our bodies and eventually released into urine. That's why you get to go to the bathroom a lot when you drink. Changes in weight, such as dehydration after drinking too much, are transient and will return to the original weight over time.Alcoholism A is caused by excessive alcohol intake. When you drink excessively, you stop eating other calories and this creates a nutritional imbalance. Alcoholism sufferers are drying up not because of the low calorie content of their alcohol, but because they don't eat anything else.■ Unsufferable alcohol weight … Let's keep this in mind when drinking to stay healthy!Experts say the most important thing to stay healthy when drinking is not to drink too much. It's also a good idea to have a meal before drinking. Many people think they will gain weight when going out for a drink after a meal, but because alcohol raises the blood sugar level and causes hunger, it is more possible to eat more snacks on an empty stomach.Avoid sweet drinks because they are higher in calories and cause appetite. Also, fermented alcoholic beverage such as makgolI and wine is apt to gain weight because they contain grains, fruit, and other by-products. Drinking water is also helpful. If drink water frequently, feel full and eat less food and promote disassociation of alcohol.( hoek Planing & Configurations : Kim Do-kyoong, Jang AramDesign : Kim Eun-jung, Correspondent Staff Redistributions (getset@sbs.co.kr) [Na Do-Kyung & Company's Uncompetitive Advocation] Help Victims of SBS On July 21, a female broadcaster, B.J., danced and chatted with viewers on an Internet One-on-the-net television platform, Africa TV.

According to a report released by the OECD last August, Koreans spent 2069 hours per year on average, the longest working day in the world after Mexico (2255 hours). Koreans also sleep less. According to OECD figures in 2016, the average Korean sleeping time is 7 hours, 41 minutes, or 40 minutes shorter than the average of those surveyed. Experts say that the shorter sleeping hours were due to late nights and frequent dinners.In addition, Koreans were also found to have the highest retirement age in terms of both men and women among OECD members. That means Koreans will remain in the labor market in some form the longest.

Compared to 10 years ago, the number of elderly people who work increased by as much as 7.1 million.However, the jobs that these elderly people take can hardly be called decent jobs. The number of temporary workers aged 65 and over who worked for temporary workers jumped from 887,000 in 2010 to 1,609,000 last year, accounting for 22.8 percent of them. The actual employment distribution of senior citizens is as simple as 25.6 % (service or sale workers) and higher than simple labor (service or selling workers) (22.9 %) and agricultural and fishery (14.7 %).How old are these working seniors who retired from their main job?

Men worked a little longer, with men working at the age of 51.4 and women 47.2. Older adults who want to work more in the future were, on average, 72 years old when they wanted to continue working. Respondents aged 75 to 79 wanted to work until they were 81, as their work-hungry age increased as the respondent grew older.It is the lack or lack of income due to old age that Koreans continue to work. According to the National Statistical Office, only 45.3 percent of the senior citizens received pension in the past year. The average monthly pension is 520,000 won. As a result, the portion of recipients who received pension income less than 100,000 to 250,000 won per month was the highest at 46.8 %, and that of recipients who received 1.5 million won or more per month was 8.7 %.◇ Insurance Research Institute of Korea : Half of the middle class before retirement moved to the poor. ’’ In this country with the highest rate of poverty among OECD members, the gap between the overall poverty rate and the elderly is also the highest. While the difference between the poverty rate for the elderly and the overall poverty rate is only 1.1 percentage points, the OECD average stands at 34.4 percent. This means that in other countries, the shift between income levels is not so great after retirement, while the nation has previously meant a considerable number of the middle - and upper-middle-class classes would have been affected by the "" income cliffs, "" or the loss of income earned income from the original jobs.An insurance report by the Korea Insurance Institute said 52.9 percent of middle-aged households before retirement moved to the poor. It shows that the downward movement of income levels in the middle class before and after retirement is actually quite serious. This can be interpreted as a result of the failure to provide adequate source of old income after the severance of the working income at the main workplace.About 730,000 baby boomers will reach 65 years of age in succession each year starting in 2020. Considering that most of them are old enough to retire from their main jobs at the age of 65, many middle-class families are at risk of falling into poverty. In order to have a more comfortable retirement in an age when aging is low on the list, it is important to save more money and prepare for it. Of course, it is not easy to prepare for future old age with a limited income. However, the unprepared old age can be exhausting. As we have seen earlier, you will continue to work in your old age.Anyone who is about to retire should quickly simplify their lives and, most importantly, pay attention to spending control. After all, I can only use it in my later years as I have earned it. Another option is to reduce the size of real estate or subscribe to a monthly pension plan with a mortgage on the house where you live.In particular, anyone who is retiring before the wedding of his or her children should carefully determine how much money they will give to each other. As a result, couples have to spend a long time with the assets they have accumulated so far.[Kim ChI-wan, researcher at Hanwha Life Retirement Research Center] [Go to Chosun.com] - Works for Chosun Ilbo & Chosun.com, no reproduction or redistribution without permission"

"Trump, Xi Jinping ""When resolution notes in the event of efforts"" pressure ""of doing things you can do"" North Korea's denuclearization effort as reaffirm the performance further provocation is Donald will come out stronger sanctions.Trump, the United States president (the right) and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, laughing and talking at a ceremony held in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. For the event on the same day, China emptied its Tiananmen Square entirely. The two leaders held a press conference after the meeting but were not asked. Each made a statement at one point. The two countries chose cooperation and pragmatism rather than conflict and confrontation. However, the solution of North Korea's nuclear program remained in place. Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, the United States president (習近平) Chinese massive trade imbalance to tightening economic cooperation summit in Beijing (北京) the ninth and the problem.I had to ‘suture’ avoiding conflicts of conflicts. The North Korean nuclear issue has reaffirmed its firm commitment to denuclearization and strengthened cooperation, but failed to draw up an improvement from the previous stance. Trump usual to one's opinion that the president is China's important role. "" If we join hands with them, we can realize the North's liberation and freedom, "" your comments (referring to President Xi Jinping) said, "" this issue is resolved. "" It is the U.S. demand that oil pipes to North Korea be hooked up. We are doing our best to stop the supply of crude oil, the city head said, refusing to say so. In fact, Trump before the president's visit to China is North Korea, a crackdown on smuggling of, and stop selling trips to North Korea. In particular, the two leaders ' consensus is sensed that North Korea should prevent further provocations. But when Trump for president wants trade suspension as a ‘Security Council Resolution plus something (a)’ comment was not to come up with a definite answer. It is still cautious about the North's self-regulating sanctions. Explanatory notes at a news conference when Trump, president and to the North Korean nuclear issue a top priority, mentioned at the end of the North Korean nuclear issue. At the same time, he stressed cooperation and communication between the U.S. and China. This implies that China is not the only place to solve the North Korean nuclear issue by itself. Though the general idea of denuclearization was agreed, the various theories have proved to be different. Donald Trump the United States president and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping is under review the honor guard in front of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on July 9. President Xi also said, "" We will solve the nuclear problem on the Korean Peninsula through dialogue and negotiation. "" North Korea's nuclear test and U.S. combined ‘ssangjungdan’ of the Trump for president at the same time and reaffirm their existing position, such as checking a military option that contains a statement. Trump, president refrained from tough in Washington or Seoul, Tokyo, as in Beijing. It is possible that he is considerate of Xi, who stressed a diplomatic solution. Xi's "" Trump Administration "" was not only about the "" Emperor's Protocol, "" but also promised to purchase and invest 253.5 billion (283 trillion won) in the United States. Low approval rating and its defeat in local elections Trump president was on the ropes in the United States as flushing from the gift that can be proud of. Trump the president is satisfactory in solving the North Korean nuclear issue and trade imbalances did not get the results “I won't criticizing China” despite the high one on him.In recognition of the. When Trump's speech was announced, the press conference gave him applause. Expectations of a Chinese-Chinese relationship, the most competitive relationship of the 21st century, can not help cooperating. Trump and Xi Jinping saved their respective lives by saving each other face. Meanwhile, the final picture of the North Korean nuclear solution remained unfinished. Cigarette smoke rose in the back of an apartment complex underground parking lot in Mapo-gu, Seoul yesterday afternoon. As he approached, the young man hid his cigarette behind him. "" Did you know you weren't allowed to smoke in the parking lot? "" "" If you didn't come home after you went out, you'd have to pay for one. "" (Smoking) From now on you'd have to be in the basement. I will be careful about what I will do in the future, but I expect the smokers to stick to it, "" the man quickly pushed the cigarette out as the reporter approached him. This apartment is a non-smoking apartment. Residents have voluntarily applied to the public health center by setting stairs and underground parking lots as non-smoking areas. On July 7, the Public Health Promotion Act, which enables smokers to pay a fine of 50,000 won if they are caught smoking in a non-smoking apartment. The JoongAng Ilbo visited five non-smoking apartments (51 in Seoul) in northern Seoul on July 7 through 8. It was not expected yet. The other floor is stacked with cigarette butts in paper cups. A fine of 50,000 won was introduced on July 7, but some worry that it will not help. On July 7, I visited a non-smoking apartment in Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul. Prior to the establishment of the Public Health Promotion Law, apartments were designated as non-smoking apartments in accordance with the Seoul City ordinance in 2010. Seven years have passed and fines have been introduced, but smoking trails have been easy to spot. The passages and stairs of the corridor type apartments are the most frequent source of complaints. I checked the emergency stairs. Large ‘ No smoking ’ warning signs are posted on all 13 to 14 levels. Is this all you need? ' There are pregnant women and babies next door. Cigarette smoke has been coming in through the veranda and I smell the laundry, ' she said. Please smoke outside of the smoker's home, rooftop or apartment house, politely request. On the other floor, there are cigarette butts in the paper cups right in front of the non-smoking sign. There are warning signs at the entrance of apartments, elevators and stairs, but they do not work. No matter how much we broadcast or file complaints, it`s no use of any kind, said an official at the management office. The team is not going to immediately go, how can we impose a fine on a smoker who has only a trail? In reality, the inspection on non-smoking apartments is a rule based on on-site observations. They do not track because they have found traces. Even when public reports are received based on CCTVs, there is a limit to identifying and tracing them, said the health center. Due to time and manpower limitations, it is more difficult to spot the site. In Gangnam, the six-member unit is in charge of anti-smoking measures, and apartments will now be built. Some residents asked for more non-smoking areas. Another non-smoking apartment resident in Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, said, Many people smoke near playgrounds with their grandchildren who are not subject to fines. We hope to expand non-smoking areas. Smokers have an opposite argument. Lee Yeon-ik, the leader of the smoker community, said, "" I don't claim the right to smoke until I hurt my neighbors, "" adding, "" If you give me the peace of mind to smoke, set up a smoking booth in an apartment complex. "" It is not easy to expand non-smoking areas in apartments. I don`t know whether it will be difficult to impose fines on people who get caught once in a while, but I will impose fines on those who continue to suffer from the inconvenience, said Lim Sook-young, head of the ministry`s health promotion department. Now that we have taken the first step, settling down is the first step, Lim took a cautious stance on expanding non-smoking areas. If more than half of residents agree to the plan, it will be designated by the local government. A non-smoking area shall be designated as part of the corridor, stairways, lifts, or parking lots. It was introduced in September last year and there are 264 schools nationwide. After a 14-month promotional campaign, a 50,000-won fine was imposed on July 7. Health care centers are cracking down.

"Seoul Metropolitan Government changes the direction of the "" caring but over-the-top "" exit from the subway exit to the upward slope. Stairs are believed to be harder to climb, but they are also pointed out as a greater pressure and a risk of falling on the body.The Seoul Metropolitan Government announced on July 10 that it is considering changing the direction of escalators in its subway stations. As the exit to the ground is narrow, the only target is the upward escalator. For example, only one escalator going up by the stairs is installed at Exit 5 of Hapjeong Station (Line 2), which means that they will change their directions.According to Seoul City, there are 141 escalators in its 57 subway stations. Women, the elderly and children in high heels often complain of more difficulty walking down the stairs, a city official said, We will make a trial run and decide whether to expand it later this month.Other ways to change the direction of escalators in different time zones are also being considered. It aims to increase efficiency by operating in the down grade during the peak time and in the upward direction when the high peak time.For example, City Hall station (Line 1), where the office is packed, has more people going down to take the subway during the day but only has an up escalator running outside of history. Last year, the attendance at City Hall subway stations stood at 9694 per day, and the number of passengers who took off from work was 2381. In contrast, subway stations located in residential areas explain that it is more efficient to operate escalators that comes down during rush hour.Behind the city's plan is ' universal design. ' Universal design refers to the design of products, environments and services that allow convenient and safe use by all regardless of disabilities, age or gender.However, there are many complaints, too. Seoul city explains that young people in their 20s and 30s still prefer to go up escalators. Oh (28), an office worker near City Hall says, "" If it's hard for women in high heels to walk down the stairs, you can use the elevator, "" adding, "" It's good to say it's too much for women and seniors.

According to Sohn Mak-ju, a reporter at the Japanese Cultural Foundation for Cultural Heritage, the Japanese restaurant in Choryang-dong, Dong-gu, Busan, was hit by a crack in the wall and began to floor in June. It happened after an 18-story underground excavation project was carried out at an apartment complex near the house starting from May this year. Doors opened, some tiles broke, and the kitchen door tilted violently to make it impossible to open it.The Sone-Shape House Press Foundation for Solar House in Choryang-dong, on the brink of collapse, requested a professional safety diagnosis of the house in September to analyze the exact cause. As a result of a structural safety diagnosis, cracks and separations occurred in every part of the building due to an underground excavation right next to the apartments, and the result of a structural safety diagnosis shows that the house may collapse at any time. As the situation got worse, the foundation requested the construction company to suspend official duties on July 18 and is scheduled to make the first round of arbitration on July 16. The Cultural Heritage Administration received complaints and started investigating the truth from the same day. Japanese houses from Japanese colonial rule in Busan, which was built in 1925 of high-end housing that shows the historical value is recognized as Registered Cultural Properties in 2007. The Cultural Heritage Administration spent 300 million won to renovate the house twice in 2013 and 2016. The Ilmak Cultural Foundation said, "" We were given the go-ahead right after the renovations. "" We have filed a petition since the time of building permit for fear of damaging the cultural assets, but it was unacceptable, said an official at the foundation. There was no reason for Japanese homes in Choryang-dong to be not state-designated cultural assets but to be legally approved for construction, said an official at Busan Dong-gu Office in a statement.

The APEC summit, called AFP, also signals a rift. America insists Trump a ‘fair trade’ to ease its trade deficit is president for preferred stock will most likely. Though it is called fair trade, it is directly opposed to the concept of economic integration and free trade that China and Japan want.In particular, in the event of a new isolation actually become the focus of international free trade that Trump be president and a vivid contrast to the likely.

"The price of land after falling is rising ... 292 % of the cost of Cheongpa-dong 1-ga in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. It was confirmed that when the underdeveloped areas are rebuilt, not only the value of housing but also the value of assets rises sharply.Most of the areas with high housing prices were concentrated in Gangbuk. The price of Cheongpa-dong 1-ga in Yongsan-gu (292 percent), Ahhyeon-dong (176 percent), Bugahyeon-dong (116 percent), Seongdae-dong (144 percent) and Seongbuk-gu (144 percent) were vertical up from 4.45 million won per ㎡ to 174.84 million won. The daily result of the analysis showed that the daily economy posted real estate research firm's real estate information and real estate 114 and analyzed the average purchase price per 3.3 ㎡ in October 2007 and the current market price of apartments in October 2017Among Seoul residents, 16 percent, or 6.6 percent, said the current market price has not recovered from 2007. Among them, 6 out of 3 apartments (37.5 %) belonged to Gangnam, Seocho, and Songpa. The numbers of such items are : Garak-dong (- 22 percent) in Songpa-gu and Dogok-dong (- 5 percent) in Gangnam-gu. It is unusual to see that housing prices in Seoul (18.5 %) and provincial areas (34.5 %) have both risen 10 years ago. Experts analyzed that the investment landscape of real estate in Seoul is changing. High yields in the Gangbuk area are breaking the formula of "" real estate = Gangnam. "" With sufficient development of transportation, education and living infrastructure, the Gangnam area now means that people can choose to live in better housing, even if they pay a higher price than their investment returns. "" Gangnam may not be too high in terms of ' maturity ' in terms of urban development, "" said Choi Mook-jung, a professor at the Graduate School of Environment at Seoul National University, with stable housing values such as infrastructure rather than investment. Shim Kyo-eon, a real estate professor at Konkuk University in Seoul, said, Considering the 53 percent rise in the southern outskirts of Seocho, Gangnam is not necessarily the first place to be invested should the Gangnam area continue to be under development. Most of the East are behind in the top rate of housing prices in residential areas, spurred by the area of Moon Jae-in government's plan in the aftermath of the 'Urban Regeneration in the New Deal'.There are even concerns about. In reality, Cheongpa-dong and MallI-dong are related to redevelopment in Seoul Station, Ahyeon-dong and Bugahyeon-dong in Ahyeon Newtown, and Seogyo-dong in Hongdae development. The development project is also expected to start in areas with high rates of decline, such as Nopyeong-dong 5-ga in Yeongdeungpo-gu, Hawangsim-dong in Seongdong-gu, Magok-dong in Gangseo-gu, and Seongsu-dong 1-ga in Seongdong-gu.Of course, some said, "" Don't ask me about investment "" based solely on development plans. Some say Cheongam-dong (- 27 percent), Hangangno 1-ga (- 19 percent), which has not recovered since prices plummeted due to the cancellation of Yongsan development. It is clear that the redevelopment of underdeveloped areas will add value to both housing and property, and although there are many problems such as evacuees and excessive investment in the development process, efforts have been made to resolve them and to continue with the development. [Sohn Dong-woo] : An endless premium reading from the news. Today's major news, read directly by the announcer and read about it. The bicycle lacks a dedicated road, so it must coexist with the car on tight roads. Some bike riders, who they believe are illegal, do acrobatic maneuvers on and off the road and in India. Many car drivers spook their bikes.◇ Compact and dangerous bicycle path = Shin (34), a member of Dongho bike, does not use a bicycle lane that is separated by one to 1.5 meters on the side of the road. He saw several buses and trucks honking along the side of the bike while other lanes were empty. Shin said, It is my mistake to follow traffic rules, but my reluctance to take a look at bicycles on the road is also problematic.There are four bike paths. Bike-only roads only ride bicycles. Be divided into separate units and alarm posts For bike-and-walker lanes, bicycles are drawn on the pedestrian corridor. The bike lane is the shoulder of a bike lane. Draw pictures of bicycle and arrows. A bicycle path is a shared road between cars and bicycles. Install in a lane with relatively few motor vehicle traffic.There are four bike paths. Bike path, bicycle path, and bicycle path, separated on the side of the road, are the first bicycles for bicycles and cars to use. Among the 2,176 kilometers of bike paths nationwide, only 13.4 percent (2,843 kilometers) are bicycle lanes. It is a bicycle and pedestrian mall with 77.1 percent. As cars are frequently involved in bicycle accidents, accidents occur frequently. Pedestrians and bicycles, cars and bicycles must fight to gain possession of the same road.On July 25, the road north of Mapo Bridge in Mapo-gu, Seoul, has turned into a one-meter-wide bike lane. The bicycle had to run 150 meters alongside a vehicle that was speeding more than 60 kilometers per hour from the edge of the road. Most bicycles running through here were designated cars and were instead delivered. Moon Ja-yeon (31), who often ride his bicycle across Mapo Bridge, said, I felt as if I had been hit by a bicycle, as the cars were running around on my side.Three bicycles were running in the bus lane of Hannam Ogeo-ri, Yongsan-gu, Seoul on July 30. They cut in between cars to pass a bus that stopped at a stop and ran 20-30 meters. The nearby cars hooted at the bicycle. Shin (31), a bike ride member, said, There is no bike road from Hannam Ogeori to Namsan Mountain, and said, "" You should drive only on the shoulder of the road law, but you should not stop your bike from riding on vehicles and buses. ""◇ The bicycle drivers who choose convenience over law are responsible for the dangerous cohabitation of bicycles and vehicles, such as the collision between council and civic groups, over bicycle paths. In particular, bicycles running recklessly in mountainous areas and parks where there is no distinction between bike paths are being claimed. One of them is Bukaksan Pass, located in Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, which is often visited by Jajeoneongeon-gwang-gil residents, along the ridge of Bukaksan Mountain to Octagonal Pavilion. A two-lane ramp that is 7.15 kilometers long and has no distinction between bike and road has many sharp turning points, which increases the risk of accidents.Car drivers ask the Seoul Metropolitan Government to ' block the bike's passage. ' On the other hand, bicycle drivers complained that they ' ask for a bicycle path. ' As conflicting complaints continued, the Seoul Metropolitan Government sent out letters of intent last month to bike clubs, local police stations and the dong office. The message was to get the bike to the right and the car to drive slowly and safely on a bend. We have no choice but to make concessions and walk along the road because it is only 7 meters wide, said an official at the Seoul Bike Policy Bureau.It is also difficult to recklessly increase bike paths. Many nearby residents and merchants protest against the move. In August, the Seoul Metropolitan Government announced that it would change the eight lanes of Jongno to four cars, two buses and two bicycles. The following day, the council voted to cancel the construction of a bike path in Jongno. The merchants of Jongno refused to add bike lanes on account of the growing traffic jams. About 400 bicycle civic groups members then went to protest in front of the Jongno District Office on July 25. Dozens of bicycles were left on the floor and hung flags reading ' Yes! ' on the Jongro-dong bike path. Han Man-jung, head of the Green Bike Community Association, argued that the transportation system should be centered around pedestrians and bicycles. Despite some controversy, we will continue to build the bike as planned with the special use of bicycles in Jongno, city officials said.Jang Taek-young, a researcher at Samsung Traffic Safety and Culture Institute, said, "" As the population grows, bicycle and car drivers should have a sense of traffic safety. "" "" Bike drivers should be able to use the same road, without having to use a special road. """
