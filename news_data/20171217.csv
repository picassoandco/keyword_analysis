Tens of thousands of people have been missing since last year in the new Uighur district. They are presumed to have been handed over to a secret concentration camp operated by China for ideological injection without trial, but no one knows what really happened. The Shin-UrouI region is turning into a scary police station under close surveillance. 2017.12.17 A secret concentration camp in China last year took to Uighur, China where no one knows how to deal with the AP or Nusheesheep Yusejin went. His neighbors, classmates, and even his mother do not know. His mother wept and wept, "" I don't know whether my son is alive or not. "" Friend the Member for Uighur is speculating that he might have been sent to a secret concentration camp for the influence-peddling without any trial like the tens of thousands of other missing persons. Many people have been missing in the new Uighur district since last year. It is time for the Chinese authorities to set up a secret camp to inject ideology into the region, judging that the new Uighur district has been affected by Islamic ideology. This has turned the place into a police station ruled by fear. Many unprecedented police officers have been deployed in many new towns. Wherever the Uighur goes, surveillance eyes are on them, watching what they say. AP recently conducted an interview with a dozen Uighur residents who had left China to investigate the reality of the worsening police state spreading to the Uighur. They consistently requested anonymity because of fears that the remaining family members would face punishment from authorities. Because of this, they could not disclose the student's name, either. The new local government has refused AP's repeated calls for comment. However, the Chinese government insisted that stronger security in the new region was necessary in the wake of a series of terrorist attacks in 2013 and 2014, including the train station deadly violence that killed 33 people. Baochang Hui, the president of the Huatian Sunjeol Room, argued, Without the security of the town, hundreds of people would have died in the same line of terrorist attacks a few years ago. Chinese authorities claimed the secret camp was for vocational training. But the main aim is to instill in them an ideology. During the three months of confinement, which lasts for at least two years, prisoners are educated in inter-racial unity, extremism, and patriotism. AP reporter who visited a concentration camp in Kuara, southern Shendong, said, "" Police are the most vigilant place on earth. "" dbtpwls@newsis.com>"
""" Determination""…Virtual that the Bitcone Payment Revocation and Revocation store (Seoul = Yonhap News) pays in bills and pays in bills at a restaurant in Janghang-dong, Ilsandong-gu, Gyeonggi-do. ▽ Commission=Conference News] Kwon Young-cheon : Amid the rapidly growing trend of investing in virtual coins and bills, general stores in Korea are also seeing their customers invest in their coins. It is interpreted that merchants have begun to believe that Bitcone is reliable enough to be used in everyday economic activities. Rojas, a furniture store on Pocheon Furniture Street in Gyeonggi Province, promised to receive Bitcone starting on July 15 and put an open cover in front of the store to allow the payment of Bitcons. Hong Jae-hyung, the head of the store, told Yonhap News Agency on July 17, Bitcoin is very popular these days and decided that it would be okay to make a payment with the won. Although there has not been any case of receiving payment for a product with Bitcone since the Bitcone payment system was just applied, Hong expects that the bill for Bitcone will increase significantly in the future. "" We may be the first store in the furniture industry to receive beatcore, "" he said, adding, The furniture industry did not seem interested in the workers ' age yet.Fortune Furniture Street is also equipped with an open window on Bitcone Street in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province. Midami Tunado, a restaurant in Ilsan, Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, also started paying virtual currency about three months ago. Sohn Chung-jae, head of the restaurant, said, I have been interested in Bitcone since the beginning of this year and trusted in its technology. Sohn said, "" As it takes a long time to transfer the bills from the exchange in the case of Bitcone, I usually use a kind of alternative virtual currency called a Ripple to make a payment. `` If it is short, but we have a steady customer who pays for food with a ripple, '' he said. `` It may still be a volatile market, and it will be difficult for you to pay for it, but later on in the drawing. '' The gel, a wine bar in Itaewon, Yongsan-gu, Seoul, also received the bit coin since early this year. A store clerk in Ilsan said, "" I understand that the president has also invested in Bitcoin, so I start to be interested in it. "" "" Usually, the bill is paid by Bitcone, a discount store owner, and sometimes times. "" Meanwhile, some stores even withdrew their business on the other hand after receiving a bit coin. Four years ago, the first store in Korea that allowed customers to pay their bills in December 2013, and Incheon City Hall decided not to pay their own bills. "" I heard that some people initially pay for bread with a bit coin, but sometimes got worn out with less interest, "" the store owner explained, shutting down last year. Hanyang University also started the Bitcone Payment System in 2014 with its campus store, New York Hotdog, under the supervision of a student venture company created by students. Kim Il-seon, a former professor at Hanyang University who directed the establishment of the student venture company at the time, said, "" The payment was not made in many cases. If you want to buy a new one, you can buy a new one. "" (Twitter) Some Internet users created Bitcone Account, received donation with Bitcone, and paid the fee for their Facebook Twitter friends by paying the fee. It is a playful way of posting and not likely to make any donation with an actual bit coin to social networking site friends, but it is that part of the fact that Bitcone has become so familiar among Internet users. When e-mail was first launched, we could not use the email without someone to send it, and we need to form an ecosystem of users, stores and distribution networks to make virtual money a payment method, Kim said. As the exchange has recently grown a lot and the number of users is on the rise, we expect the payment of virtual currency to become more general with a certain level of stability, he added. comma@yna.co.kr He watched Internet broadcasting and made a reckless attempt to follow in investment, but lost interest due to huge losses. B.J., the Internet broadcasting company, is known to have made millions of won in investment and made hundreds of millions of won in single-time transactions. Kim confessed that he believed the fact that seeing which B.J. buys and sells virtual currency and copying it would give him a good profit would make him a good profit. When B.J. buys a low-priced item, the price jumps as the audience gathers pace. Kim said, "" If B.J. sells the product again, the price goes down, but no matter how long the program is live, the person who follows it loses money. "" Internet broadcasting that shows the actual investment screen of virtual currency is carried out in dozens of episodes per day. In some cases, the number of viewers of popular Internet broadcasting programs is close to 5,000. Of course, some viewers are saying that they have earned money through Internet broadcasting. As it provides quick information on virtual currency investment, it creates chat rooms for paid groups in online messengers such as TelegramCacacotal and guides customers to buy certain stocks. A 25-year-old college student entered a paid chat room by paying all his pocket money and making a small sum of money when he started investing in virtual currency. However, the information that came out of the book was not very different from what was said elsewhere and did not result in profit, Choi said. Choi said, "" I bought it hard at first to constantly recommend low-manufactured virtual bills, but I lost money by making profits, "" adding, "" I felt I was speculative, not giving information. ""Investors are flocking to the virtual currency craze, but the victims like Kim and Choi are called non-market financial analysts. They say that they suffer from the practice of blindly copying anyone who is leading the way because there is no place to get reliable information. Professor Oh Jeong-keun at Konkuk University, chairman of the Korea Financial and ICT Association, told Yonhap News Agency on July 17, The accumulated cases of such damages hurt the related industries and create an advisory body for virtual currency analysis and evaluation. runran@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"Now that I have sent a signal to China, I have received a message of apology from Hanshin University reporter Shim Jung-il, and from Professor Seo Jin-young of the University of Chinese's Hall of Fame and Appraisal as part of China ` neglect. Moon Jae-in jomungyu a president's visit follows is how they are written about in history. They are rude protocols, schedules, missing key agreements, and even violent assault by Chinese security guards on Korean journalists. As many diplomatic events took place during the state visit, controversies continued to rise. Over the past 50 years into China, with ‘a pioneer in Chinese’ seojinyeong, professor emeritus at Korea University (75) said Moon Jae-in, the government and field, but it is ‘stop the war.’.“China, South Korea could lead to the Koreans lost his mind at the same time that in the world.” high, and lost trust and pride of Koreans in Japan and the United States. ""Criticism. Q : Is this meeting a successful or a failed one?Strategically access to China since preparation of the Moon Jae-in, the government talks : a. It is because it sent a message that it would solve the Korean Peninsula by strengthening its strategic cooperation with China. Hasty in what we call the (not to place them additional THAAD md of the United States system does not admit in the US-Japan military alliance does not develop into) position ‘3’ (不)Moon Jae-in, and his president ‘Japan is not our allies.’ high in the face of Donald Trump the president and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. As for the U.S. - Japan's humanitarian and Pacific strategies, the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae insisted, "" There is no need to be incorporated. "" Furthermore, through this summit meeting, the U.S. and Japan clearly stated that they will explore the 21st century with China instead of the Cold War East Asian order based on trilateral security cooperation. Q : The government has made a point in agreeing on the four principles - the impossibility of war on the Korean Peninsula, sticking to denuclearization, resolving the North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue and negotiations, and improving inter-Korean relations. A : The U.S. opposed the military option of North Korea, saying it would not, and that the South Korean government, the most influential ally, and China, itself have eliminated its strong option of pressuring the North and are armed. The key point of "" how to get North Korea into the negotiating table "" was also omitted. The North has kept its nuclear weapons program helpless. Professor Seo, president of the greatest loss in this visit is the door said “point lost trust in the United States and Japan”. Moon Jae-in is the United States government over the next four years or so after the South Korean government and, in dealing with North Korean issue, far should the Security and Cooperation in the Korean government would be helpful.That can't help but doubt the situation. Abe's administration, which has criticized Korea as being inclined to China, will surely determine that Korea is not a country to share the values of its work and work. It is possible that the U.S. and Japan will not support the idea at a time when the U.S. rules out Korea and takes independent measures toward North Korea. The most terrifying example is when the foreign exchange crisis hit 20 years ago. It was economic bankruptcy can befall a bankruptcy, but military and security in the future. "" Professor Seo is president, also mentioned three times the Nanjing Massacre (Nanjing).As a problem. While Moon Jae-in, governments have the Nanjing by Japanese history to China and the high sea bream through the alliance, which could go to (Donatien Alphonse Francois de Sade and thaad) defend the other three nations system, the strategic detour.It seems to think that you can evoke the cooperation. However, this is a dangerous step to give up Japan. Even though China is stronger, it will have to work with the U.S. and Japan for the next 20 years. What are they trying to gain by forcing Japan to do so? What have you got from China? "" Q : The opening day has been controversial.A : If they did not know the 80th anniversary of the massacre at Nanjing, they were ignorant, and if they knew it, they decided to break off all ties with the U.S. and Japan and move into China. I wonder who set the date and what intention it was. Q : South Korea had high hopes for a summit this year.A : China was ' not yet ready to discuss ' from the beginning, showing an insincere attitude. On the other hand, the government tried to restore public relations and encourage North Korea to participate through the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. ‘3’ Saade, if given to the Chinese for the Pyeongchang, North Korea is getting better, and when they show improvement in inter-Korean relations, and drag the international community, the government's Moon Jae-in will go up.In a series of ideas by Xi Jinping, like trying to meet the (習近平) that his country. Pyeongchang will host the Tokyo Olympics two years later and Beijing Winter Olympics two years later. You could have painted that East Asia could be made into a place of peace and festivals through the three Olympics focused on Korea, China and Japan, and thought that China would be the one that would lead you. The problem is that I have read China wrong. The protocol and schedule of the summit was the worst, and this lost the people's self-esteem. Professor Seo analyzed, "" Unlike the Korean government's approach to the strategy, China's approach was realistic in securing national interests based on power. "" Q : What has China gained? A : South Korea has shown the world that it takes humiliation and sticks to the ' Great China. ' In particular, the United States. ' Look. Your favorite Korea is coming to me. ' It is very meaningful to drag away one's valuable card from another in the politics of superpowers. Q : Why didn't China approach strategically?A : I think there is a national political dimension. It is said that President Xi Jinping is taking absolute power, but he has not made any clear achievements in foreign policies. Although the government is pushing for a one-to-one policy on the six - and sea-shore Silk Road, its relationship with the U.S., Japan, and neighboring countries is also strained. China, in particular, was repeatedly humiliated by North Korea. It is possible that they are using the issue of Korea to build up the pride and pride of the superpower to their people. Professor Seo "" Moon Jae-in, the government over the next 20 years to read and respond to the great flow of the international community without capacity is correct, but realistic and step-by-step series of deliberate upon one's sleeve.The international community, exposing the criticism. There are different strategic goals and practical foreign policies. If we don`t cross each other, we can be swept away by a torrent, said Korean Foreign Relations, which is surrounded by superpowers, in order to emphasize bridging displacement. We use the term bridge diplomacy and brokerage diplomacy, and I also call it "" Bokdongbang diplomacy. "" You must have the confidence of both sides to sell your house. We have to be careful in what we say and be honest. In other words, Korea is seen as a traitor for the United States and an opportunist for China. This way, at a crucial moment, several powerful countries can cook the Korean Peninsula without South Korea. "" Q : How can we solve the North Korean nuclear issue? A : If this continues, we can not help but condone or recognize North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons. They will have nuclear weapons and strong conventional weapons. Israel of Northeast Asia As Israel does in the Middle East, no country can touch whatever they do. I have no choice but to be led around. Korea and Japan have no choice but to discuss nuclear armament of their own. The United States will also go to the game, which will pressure China with nuclear weapons allowances cards for South Korea and Japan. Q : If this option isn't working. A : I'll put Kim Jong-un's regime change on the table, except for South Korea and Japan's nuclear armament and the North's military options. One day, the new North Korean leader, who was replaced in some way, would abandon nuclear weapons or leave control to the United States, China and the international community. To do so, it requires strong pressure from North Korea. The United States and China must cooperate. It is important to note that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson recently announced that he discussed a sudden situation with China. Q : What do you think of the Korean journalist abuse scandal?A : There were a lot of foreign journalist violence in China. BBC and German journalists were also beaten. However, it is a matter of a different dimension that such an incident took place during a state visit. The president's visit to China the door is landlord's busy out as a way to ‘I'll wait for It's okay.’ come to be on schedule. Although I don't think the Chinese government meant it, I do think the whole sentiment that Beijing is neglecting Korea has been revealed by the violence. It is quite impossible for a guest like President Xi Jinping to take a step forward. Professor Seo, "" Moon Jae-in, the government sijeongjappae Hanshin who swallowed the insult and gear in the crotch and Manchu invasion in Choi Myung-kil state of mind, i.e. humiliation is a bit of the Korean Peninsula.Strategic cooperation with China to build peace in the Korean Peninsula for the war may have been in talks with the idea of creating a framework "" and "" These sentiments.Can we continue the diplomatic concerns, said based on wrong. Local politics can go this way or the other way, but diplomacy can`t afford to make mistakes by trial and error. Always jingeom to his administration should exert diplomatic game.

The official said the president is the door when I went to Washington, Trump the president came to Seoul for a summit between leaders, saying only at a time table when "".In the course of this schedule did not think that it will go at all, the problem. “In the past, our president he visited China when official dinner ever once, and Oh.” he added.It was very unusual for a cultural concert organized by China, he explained. The two leaders ` continued presence was a very drastic courtesy on the part of China, said Chung, explaining why they delayed the opening of the concert since the 80th anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre.The following is a question and answer with the president : q ‘eating alone’ said the nation's high. What do you think?A : I don't think there was a big problem. See examples of the past, the past, our president when he visited China in some cases, formal ever had one dinner and Oh. I never thought it was a problem in the run-up to the event. The issue of ' Honbap ' was a warding that touched the nation's control line. Trump, the president once ate together in South Korea. Moon Jae-in the same when I went to Washington was president. So it is not understandable to make a ' mixed bag frame '. There are so many other important issues, I think there will be briefings on cultural events later on, and briefings on dinners as well, so let's see if that's a case of misunderstanding in advance The case of cultural events was very unusual. China did not hold such events often and was reluctant to make public. The show was also delayed because they did not think it was appropriate to perform because it was the 80th anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre. The performance was good, and the two leaders ' stay with each other was a very drastic reception for China. It is to be regretted that such a part was not delivered.Q : I'm curious to follow up on the news attack. Does the Chinese authorities report any results from the survey yet?

How meaningful is that?A : It was very widely discussed that we should normalize all ties that have not been stopped or proceeded due to problems outside the economy.Q : Is it clear that we have agreed to normalize trade that has been visually negative for Korea and China?A : There has been talk of specifically having been an end to some problems. It made it clear that we should normalize everything. It is not just about the economy. High-level channels between ministries and existing networks will also recover completely. "" Feeling a bit mistaken, Rickerchang's channel was separate from the channel mentioned during his summit with President Xi Jinping.Q : It has been said China has significantly decreased in leverage with North Korea, have you confirmed how much leverage China has had in the talks? He said he would solve North Korea peacefully, but at the U.N. Security Council on Friday night, Tillason said China should play a bigger role. Were there any discussions between the two leaders on that point?A : The summit did not agree on China's very specific role in pressuring the North. But the preparation of the summit was specific. However, during the summit, there was a remark that China should play a more important role in getting the North to talk. China stressed that it is faithfully implementing the U.N.

Local governments and provincial governments will crack down on the price of accommodations during 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. The ministry said it will organize joint screening teams in Gangwon Province, Gangneung, Pyeongchang-gun and Jeongseon-gun and run them regularly starting this month until the end of the Winter Paralympics in March. Earlier, some accommodations in Gangwon Province set a fee of 1 million won per night, sparking a controversy over charging for the Games. Some also point out that they refuse individual short-term customer reservations. The joint inspection team will go through a pre-public period from 18th to 24th and begin an intensive crackdown from 26th to January 31st next year. We will investigate the excessive rate of accommodation, non-reserving and other room-related complaints, as well as illegal items such as sanitary, cleanliness, illegal alterations and unauthorized storage. They will ask for cooperation to host the Games successfully and take corrective measures when they detect any cases of hygiene or building violations. The joint inspection team consists of five or six members, including a head of the Ministry of Public Administration and Security team, a bugging team, and three government employees in charge of construction and sanitary policies. Even when the joint inspection team is not in operation, Gangwon Province and each host city will organize their own inspection teams during the Olympics.

However, as the public office is worried over the low reservation rate recently, the level of sanctions will be decided later after a review.

""" Did you release the dolphins that have been on the show for nearly 20 years? "" (Jeju Island = Yonhap News Agency), "" We must recognize the achievements and values of the water spill for the past five months. "" (Daejicheol, a man who spent 25 years on a grand show, and a male dolphin in his hometown)Golden Light and cannon (Jeju = Yonhap News Agency) ; Park Jiho (Ju-ho) : After being entangled in fishing nets in Jeju Sea, the cannon was moved to a swimming beach with humans from Jeju Island during the last 19-20 days ; and a large cannon for the adaptation of men from Jeju Island The release of the large-sized dolphins is the third time this year since Jedol, 3,388, Chunsam and Boksoon were released in 2013. They were released off the coast of Hamdeok, Jocheon-eup, Jeju City, on July 18, 2006, but no one discovered them until about 150 days later. This is a rare example from the days when large male dolphins, which were released in 2013 and 2015, were discovered in five to 16 days, and lived in close contact with wild animals. When it was decided to release the gold and other cannon, it was not free from worry. As Geum-dong and Chun-sam had lived together for a long time from 19 to 20, they spent about three to six years performing, and returned to nature on the fifteenth of lunar January. Geumdae was caught in a fishing net in Jungseong-dong, Seogwipo City, in 1998, and entered the zoo in 1999 (then 7-8 years old) and 2002 (then 9-2 years old, respectively). Jedoli et al are five of the last 11 large dolphins of the Nambang Zoo that were captured from May 2009 to August 2010. "" Hello, Geumdang, Geumdang, and Imheong, a cannon ball park, "" was held at Gwancheon Newso Park. The two teams will go back to their hometown, Jeju Island, on July 22. 3,800 out of the five people who spent the shortest time on the market at kane@yna.co.kr were discovered in 2013, but could not escape due to damaged nets. Researchers say this was because they were curious most and kept more wild than Jedoli. As people associate with the mountain in 10 years, and see how the gold and cannon's discharge into the wild would allow them to live longer than in nature. Since the dispute over the return of dolphins from all over the world to nature had continued after living in aquariums for a long time, the release of gold and cannon was of great interest overseas. What happened to the gold and cannon and the lights that went back to the sea? There are two main cases where people believe they may have moved to another region and died before being able to adapt to the wild.Q : It is not easy to go home (Yonhap news agency), Hwang Gwang-mo : The last big dolphin, "" Geum-byeong, "" remaining at the Seoul Grand Park water tank, will be transported to Hamdeok, Jeju Island on the morning of July 22. The two large dolphins, the Geumbang and Daepo, were caught in a net off Jeju Island and are scheduled to return to their home waters after a natural adjustment period. The large-sized dolphin is an endangered species known to inhabit only about 110 animals off Jeju Island. The possibility of being left alive is high, said Professor Kim Byung-yup of Jeju University, who has been involved in the discharge of large-sized dolphins from Nambang, hkmpooh@yna.co.kr for many years. Large dolphins, which normally swim about two kilometers off Jeju Island, are carried to land on the currents when they die, but so far no bodies of such whales are believed to have been found. Kim said, Since July of this year, we have found four to five dead large male dolphins. Though the rot was severe, the shape and appearance of his teeth indicated that he was not a cannon or a gold lantern. After confirming the bodies, the Seoul Grand Park Zoo has reached the same conclusion, explained the official. He can be found primarily in ""Dolphins live they left the area where hundreds of cases often found in other areas, a town."" and "" donghae.Long-beaked common dolphin is off the coast of Jeju April this year Common Bottlenose dolphin, who live in Jeju, Japan and living in a net ever found dead on shore. "" "" onshore or across the country and ""The latest move to the donghae donghae along the coast during the defense might have been sent to Japan, and may have to rule out it will not"" again.You configure the network because they don't know what gold and guns were found in Japan monitoring, explained. Professor Kim still tours the Jeju coast in search of gold and other cannon.Asiana Airlines dispatched two large dolphins to Jeju to transport the remaining two large dolphins to Jeju at the Seoul Grand Park. Asiana Airlines said Monday that a large group of male dolphins, including the Golden Sea, from Seoul Grand Park, was transported to Jeju Island by charter from Incheon Airport. The dolphins were loaded into a charter tank with a specially made horizontal area of 321 cm, 91 cm long, and 106 cm tall. The photo shows Asiana Airlines Incheon Transit Service employees working to transport dolphins. "" It is unfortunate, but I don't think she is alive, "" said Chang Yi-kwon, an ecoscience professor at Ewha University. During his visit to Jeju in early September, Chang went on a hunt for dolphins in the same university, with Jang Soo-jin and Kim Mi-yeon, who studied blue whale. Jedori with the number "" 1 "" on her dorsal fin at the time was found, as well as Boksoon, who had been released due to birth defects and birth of her young, was not found with gold and cannon. `` First of all, released dolphins behave more carefully in strange environments. When they stay near the familiar coastline to some extent, they gradually move farther and farther, explained a group of dolphins who had never been seen since they were released from Jeju and were very unlikely to have moved to other areas. Chang said, "" We needed to be more careful when bringing dolphins from the aquarium back to the wild. We followed the international advice of the reforms. "" And added, "" Of course, it is necessary to have no trauma or disease on your part. "" In the left picture, Chun-sam and the baby dolphin swimming on their dorsal fin with the number ' 2 ' on it, and if the right picture shows a baby dolphin swimming, the organic dolphin and the baby dolphin swim. Of course, since we did not participate in the discharge process of the gold and cannon, it is hard to say on what basis we decided to release the water and whether the judgment was correct. "" "" Some people say it would be better to live and die in the open for even one day, but it is still confusing that one should not pass the standard of discharge, "" he said. It is debatable. However, the release of the three large sea dolphins has changed people's perceptions of the "" war animals, "" and has helped them realize that animals are a natural community that should be respected with humans. No one can deny that the released dolphins have achieved unprecedented success around the world, twice confirming breeding in the wild. Jedoli, who returned to her hometown of Jeju in 2013 after illegally capturing it by jumping people at a dolphin show, is currently in the offing in Gujwa-eup, Jeju. Jedoli's dorsal fin is marked with the number 1. 2016.8.7 [Yonhap News Agency] ▶ Report and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting latest trends (click!)"

It is analyzed that parents ' change of perception to utilize their homes for old age rather than handing them down to their children has played a major role.It is also a similar pattern to how parents try to continue their economic activities, such as resolving their own living expenses.The proportion of parents who spent their own money on living after increasing from 46.6 percent in 2008 to 48.9 percent in 2012 has increased to 52.6 percent last year.

"[Graphic] : Annual income is more than five times higher than annual income. According to the Bank of Korea (BOK) on July 17, the ratio of household loans (LTI) to the income of the third fiscal quarter is estimated to reach 12.1 percent. They need to collect no income for more than five years to repay the principal. Among the approximately one million households ' loan database, the ratio of borrowers with more than LTI 500 percent increased by 9.7 percent in the first quarter, an increase of 0.5 percent point (point) in the first half. In 2012, it stayed in the 6-percent range with 6.6 percent, 6.2 percent in 2013 and 6.8 percent in 2014, but in 2015 and 2016, it jumped to 8.0 percent and 9.5 percent in 2016. It is believed to have been the result of the increase in the number of borrowers who borrowed excessively into debt compared to their income since the government eased regulations on lending, such as the debt-to-equity ratio, in August 2014.The LTI average was 210.7 percent in the third quarter. On average, they have a loan of a little over two years ' income. The LTI average jumped from 166.2 percent in 2013 to 203.9 percent in 2016, exceeding 200 percent for the first time. In the first quarter of this year, 205.5 percent saw a rise of 5.2 percent in just six months. Less than 100 percent of LTI's total shares were 59.6 percent in 2012, but now the 50 percent level is threatened. It dropped from 52.6 percent in the first quarter of this year to 51.7 percent in the third. The central bank expects the household debt burden to grow with the weak as debt levels continue to rise relative to income, with the future rise in lending rates.Household debt is still growing at a fast pace despite the government's putting the brakes on it. In the third quarter, household credit topped 1,400 trillion won with 119.1 trillion won. It also gained about 10 trillion won per month in October and November. Household credit rating rose 1.3 percent to 94.1 percent in the third quarter from the end of last year. Household credit growth has exceeded the long-term trend for 13 consecutive quarters. As household debt grew faster than income, the ratio of disposable household debt to disposable income rose 5.6 percent to 155.5 percent at the end of the year. The ratio jumped to 21.6%p in three years, up from 133.9 percent in the third quarter of 2014. If you are heavily in debt, you are less likely to recover from a default. The central bank tracked those who became delinquent in debt in 2014, and only 42.5 percent of the respondents who received a credit recovery rate of LTI 100 percent or higher as of late June. It was a far cry from less than 62.8 percent who answered 25 percent. merciel@yna.co.kr According to the 15-day Kyunghyang Daily, residents at a nearby studio in Gangneung, Gangwon Province, are trying to send out university students and give rooms to tourists. This is a trick to make Pyeongchang's 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics special, taking advantage of its lack of sleep. Damage is rising especially in January and February, when re-signing is concentrated with the new semester ahead. The student council of the University of Gangneung, Gyeonggi Province issued a statement on July 13, saying, "" We can guarantee accommodation to some of the dormitories for the national event, but discuss the harm of common sense to students immediately "" Reports say some of the local studio rental companies were delaying the renewal of contracts with college students originally living to rent rooms to tourists during the Olympics. This is because of the calculation that it would be possible to make a large profit on the rent if rooms were given to tourists during the Olympics. A real estate agency representative near the university explained, It costs more than 1 million won per month to get a nearby studio during the Olympics. Considering that the average rent was between 300,000 and 400,000 won per month, it has more than tripled. The number of damages that the student council of the University of Gangneung, Wonju is known to have recorded in the past two days alone is 10. Some of them even pressed to remove the room even when the contract is open, the media said. Students are suffering from the fact that the new semester is scheduled to be held in January and February. Reinvesting is not legally problematic when studio owners refuse to do so, leaving students unable to do so. Students who planned to stay in their own rooms to attend seasonal semester classes have not found a place to go. The bigger problem is that students are not allowed to enter dormitories, either. The University of Seoul said yesterday that it would rent dormitories to the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee from July 12 to Feb. 26, when the Olympic Games are to be completed. The 2018 Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympics athletes village was built on July 15.

"Hong Moon-pyo, secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, and audit committee chairman Lee Yong-koo announced at a news conference yesterday morning in Seoul. The parliamentary inspection announced on the same day revealed that four incumbent lawmakers and 58 non-party committee chairmen failed to make a cut on the cut, and lawmakers Suh Chung-won, Yoo Ki-jun and Bae Duk-kwang are among them. This means that they should actually put out the district. Hong Moon-pyo, secretary general of the Korea Party, and audit committee chairman Lee Yong-koo announced in a news conference at their headquarters in Yeouido on July 17 that they decided to replace 62 percent of the committee's chairman. Seo Chung-won, a former member of the party committee, was appointed as the subject of an audit since he is not the chairman of the association with disciplinary action against the suspension of party membership. Suh was cut off, but Choi was reported to have received high scores. Most of the lawmakers of TK (Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province), including Choi, also received high scores. The audit committee reported the results to the party's supreme council in a blind manner. The highest level was set at 55 points per minute (three districts in Youngnam, Gangnam and Bundang) and 50 points per second region (excluding Honam). Among the heads of the ruling and opposition parties ' associations, supreme council member Ryu Yeo-hae (Seoul Seocho District) was cut off. Chairman Kim Hee-jung of Yeonje-gu, Busan and Chairman Jun Ha-jin of Bundang, Gyeonggi Province also made the cut list. The Korea Party plans to keep the results of its audit for 10 years and make them available to the public. Meanwhile, the Korea Party selected Kang Kil-bu (Ulsan Ulju), Kim Seong-tae (Seoul Gangseo), Lee Jin-bok (Busan Dongnae), and Yeo Sang-woo (Sacheon Soong-gak) as its districts.What you see next door is a free comic strip and a gift batter! ▶ Cheerleader vs. Racing Girl Woo Kyung-hee cheerup@mt.co.kr< This is Hong Joon-pyo the innovation used to stress after taking office as part of the councils, changed the whole wide audit of the executive committee of about 30 percent of large human innovation.Reality can also be evaluated. Though the measure was intended to disrupt the reform, it is expected to face a storm after strong moves by the parties due to its size. In particular, an incumbent lawmaker can only stir, councils replacement of the pro-Lee Myung-bak factions (chinbakkeunhye) could serve as a catalyst of the internal bickering, political parties, including senior members are in line.Secretary-General Hong Moon-pyo and audit committee chairman Lee Yong-koo announced the results of their audit at their headquarters in Yeouido yesterday. Among the 214 people surveyed, a total of 62 people, including four incumbent lawmakers and 58 heads of the outdoor committee, were recommended to replace them, accounting for 29.0 percent of them. The results of the parliamentary audit show that Hong's administration put more weight on innovation than stability in the run-up to next year`s local elections. The figures show that many of the members of the party's chairman committee, who has a large political influence, are recommended to replace him. First of all, the replacement of current leadership, supreme council member Ryu Yeo-hae (age : A), in Seoul`s Seocho district, suggests that the leadership was not at all engaged. Among the heads of the committee are Park Min-sik (A, Gangseo, Buk-gu, Busan), Kim Hee-jung (Busan Yeonje), Kwon Young-se (Seoul Yeongdeungpo District Office, Seoul), and Jeon Ha-jin (Busan Bundang District Council). A key official explained to Yonhap news agency that the measure is a huge one, but without such painful innovations, we can`t reform the party. Among the four incumbent lawmakers (Suh Chung-won, Yoo Ki-jun, Bae Deok-kwang and Um Yong-soo) who were appointed to replace former chairman of the party's committee, Suh Chung-won (8th) and Yoo Chung-won (8th), who were appointed as senior vice chairman of the ruling Grand National Assembly member in Seoul. The call, "" people, this is a key officials whether Korea will keep an eye on innovation in the audit of the executive committee, or the pro-Park Geun-hye faction, chinhong (Chin Hong Joon-pyo) conflicts will look at you with?.Important. "" Both possibilities are currently open. Following this audit of the executive committee recommended disciplinary action against secession Park Geun-hye, former president replace the pro-Lee Myung-bak factions that contains senior members of 'per chinbak' to help reform efforts to shed its image.to exist However, if the parties raise their voices over Hong's sapaneization of the Pro-Park Alliance target audit, chances are high that it will cause quite a stir within the party.It is also noteworthy that many of the committee chairmen who have returned from their respective parties failed to meet their counterparts. In particular, floor leader Kim Seong-tae (Seoul Gangseo), Lee Jin-bok (Dongnae-gu, Busan), and former Sanggyang-kyu (Hadong, Sacheon-si, South Gyeongsang Province), and Kim Young-seok (Seoul), Korea's floor committee chief, were all named. Among them, former MBC president Kim Jae-cheol heads the district where Yeo Sang-kyu is currently in charge of the committee. The leadership reiterated it was an `` objective audit of party affairs through a quantitative assessment '' as if it was aware of the in-house controversy over the evaluation results. But separately and objectivity of the process of these councils over the next parliamentary seat in the right party is politically, is replaced by the incumbents 'biong' (biongjunpyo) to the camp.Offensive, 'Hong Joon-pyo planting people' could provide any pretext.

"[AFP] Photo of Yonhap news agency] As it is unlikely that the VAT will be imposed as a result of the controversy over dual taxation, anonymity would be difficult to impose … The Ministry of Finance and Economy (Sejong = Yonhap news) will draw attention to the taxation system as a whole. The government is cautious about imposing VAT, as it involves double taxation while saying that the virtual currency is not subject to VAT exemption. However, it is reported that they are considering whether to legitimize the transfer income tax or the transaction tax.Bitcone [Deliver Yonhap TV] ◇ Global trend of tax deduction for virtual currency value-added tax … requires cautious access…""The Ministry of Finance and Economy said on July 17 that it will soon organize a tax assessment task composed of tax authorities, block chain experts, and others. The TF will review the details of tax-related transactions such as Bitcone, revise related laws and establish a system. One of the key issues in the taxation on virtual currency transactions is whether or not to impose VAT by interpreting the supply of virtual currency as a supply of goods. Interest has grown in virtual currency, with the government defining that VAT is not a tax-free currency or financial product. If VAT is imposed on the supply of virtual currency, the operator must pay the tax when selling the virtual currency through an intermediary exchange. In fact, although virtual currency acts as a medium for transactions, it also has the commodities of trading itself as an asset. A typical example is Bitcone, which is provided with a unique structure called mining. Bitcone is provided in exchange for releasing complicated passwords and approving real-time transactions. This is fundamentally different from the legal monetary system that supplies controlled by the central bank with consideration of the real economy's situation. The problem is that imposing VAT on the supply of virtual currency could create a double tax controversy. For example, if a customer with a legal currency wants to purchase a product with a virtual currency, he or she must exchange it into a virtual currency before the seller can exchange it for a virtual currency. If the virtual currency provider is an operator, it will incur VAT on its virtual currency, on its sales transactions and on its products, respectively. Germany and Australia have changed their previous plans to impose VAT on virtual currencies due to such issues. The Korean government is known to have not seen VAT as a positive consideration for the double taxation controversy and global trends. An official at the European Court of Law and Justice ruled that "" the VAT exemption is to be granted for the supply of Bit-Coins, "" adding, "" The entire Europe is likely to go as a single criterion, "" and added, "" the possibility of a departure from the overseas market. ""Presidential Secretary for Government Policy Coordination Hong Nam-gi (third) is chairing a meeting on virtual currency at Seoul's Seoul Central News Agency. kimsdoo@yna.co.kr 117.12.13 . and ◇ Selections for transfer gains tax require individual income data…All the "" anonymity "" walls before the transfer gains can be taxed. As the price of virtual currency has soared recently around Bit-coins, the market is overheated. The tax authorities have made it clear that "" it is a principle to levy taxes where there is income, "" but have not yet been able to impose taxes because of the lack of legal grounds. Unlike VAT, the tax on transfer gains from virtual currency is less controversial. However, the problem is that the anonymity of virtual currencies makes it difficult to obtain individual information for taxation. For example, in general virtual currency such as beatcoiner, no separate formal management bodies exist, as in coin of court. It is virtually impossible to trace the personal information of the owners on which transfer income tax is based, as transaction information is distributed and processed in the so-called ‘ block chain ’ manner. For this reason, experts point out that tax authorities need to secure data such as the transaction date, amount, and other parties to be traded by each user through the virtual currency exchange, where transaction information is concentrated. The bank needs to put responsibility on the stock market to store and manage related information to prevent tax evasion. However, there are concerns that the transaction could be sharply diminished if the stronger responsibility of the bourse is considered as a regulation limiting anonymity of virtual currencies. Some say that if the transfer income tax is taxed in all transactions, non-taxation income and equity issues could arise. The capital gains tax is also currently levied on major shareholders with a certain share and not all ordinary investors taxed. As a result, some experts predict that the taxation on the profit from the transaction of virtual currencies includes the transfer income tax, but will be designed primarily for the transaction tax, such as stock. We need personal information to collect capital gains taxes, and we need to see the market`s response to it, said a government official, adding that as a result of the nature of virtual currency, transaction taxes were not easy for us to assess. rock@yna.co.krAccording to Seoul's Yangcheon-gu Police Station, four newborns died one night while being treated at an intensive care unit of an infant at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital from 9:31 p.m. to 10:53 p.m. the same day.Police said, At about 11:07 p.m., More than one child died.

"▽ Cold conditions double the amount of blood vessels shrinking and shouldering the burden on the legs = When walking an artery disease, the core of pain in the blood vessel health is to control the high blood pressure in legs, and the eating habits of a 65-year-old man named Yoo said, "" I feel pain in my legs a lot lately. He was taken lightly because of his age, even though he had a medical checkup every year. However, the symptoms got worse when he had to take a rest and walk two or three times. Rhyu, who went to an orthopedics because he thought it was a bone or muscle problem, was told by his doctor that it was a blood vessel problem. When the ultrasonography was carried out at the university hospital, the arteries in both legs were blocked by more than 50 %. In winter, the ' Emergency Light ' is on for the health of the blood vessels. As the blood vessels contract due to the cold and the sympathetic nerves become activated to generate heat, the burden on the blood vessels doubles. Be careful not to cause an emergency medical condition such as acute myocardial infarction or stroke if there is a blood vessel problem to the heart and brain. The leg veins are affected by the seasons, just like that of the heart and brain. Unlike the heart and brain, however, leg blood vessel health is often negligent. Your legs are swollen and your skin color changes. In many cases, patients receive innocent treatment for aging and musculoskeletal disorders. The legs are a mirror that reflects the health of the entire blood vessel. The blood vessels are all connected, said Kim Hyang-kyung, a professor of vascular surgery at Jungang Hospital. If one blood vessel was damaged, it is most likely the other was either worse or worse. Bridges can feel symptoms as well as legs, and it is easier to see abnormalities in blood vessels with the eye than other areas. The prevention and management of leg blood vessel diseases is called the "" first step "" of vascular health. Leg vessel diseases are largely divided into arterial and venous diseases. The arteries are used to direct the blood of the heart to the legs, whereas the veins are used as a channel to direct the tissue of blood to the lungs. Just as each role is different, the arteries and veins differ in causes and symptoms. If leg arteries are blocked by bad cholesterol, leg pain usually occurs. Muscle receives oxygen and nutrients from the blood, but when blood vessels are blocked, it can be overloaded by poor supply of blood needed to move. If the wound does not heal well, or the skin turns white, suspect leg artery disease. The pain in the legs can easily be confused with spinal disease, such as a waist disk or spinal canal stenosis. In this case, you can measure the distance you walk within one to two hours. When it comes to spinal cord disease, the distance you walk depends on your condition. If you walk one kilometer a day and can't walk 100 meters the next, chances are high that you have spinal cord problems. However, when you have leg artery disease, you get pain every time you walk a certain distance. If blood pressure on the arm and ankle is significantly different, you should suspect a blood vessel disease, not a spine. In cases of spinal cord disease, the blood pressure in the arms and ankles is constant. If there are problems with the leg arteries, major arteries such as the heart might have been damaged, too. According to a study by the circulation department at Guro Hospital, 70 percent of patients who experienced angina due to a blocked leg artery and who needed treatment suffered from angina (chest pain caused by blocked coronary arteries in the heart). Between 10 and 20 percent of patients with coronary artery problems suffer from leg artery problems. Management of leg artery disease may have the potential to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in the brain in a secondary way. Conservative treatment of leg artery disease, such as exercise and medication, is the first priority. If symptoms are not resolved, consider the procedure of blowing up a small balloon in the blood vessel or securing a passage with a net (stent). Stents also get stuck when used for a long time. In this case, surgery to make a new pathway with an intravenous, artificial blood vessel (circumvention) can be cured. In leg veins, valves that prevent blood clots or reverse flow occur. Their legs often get swollen and their skin turns red. Helvina and calf blood vessels sometimes rattle out like worms. Symptoms of blood not being able to go up and breaking in the legs. Unlike arteries, veins can be easily confirmed by being able to see the symptoms directly. The amount of blood flow is small, so the effect on the entire body is negligible. However, varicocele is commonly operated on to remove the protruding veins. However, if deep veins are blocked by blood clots, this is a different story. If the blood clots block the pulmonary artery through the heart, you can die instantly. If you feel pain when touching your legs as they are swollen and turning red, you should see a doctor immediately for emergencies such as antihemorrhagics. Veins are easy to develop when you stay in one position for a long time. The arteries push the blood with the force of the heart to contract, but the veins in the distance do not receive the power of the heart. Instead, the muscles around them raise the blood from the bottom to the top with the force of squeezing blood vessels. If the movement decreases, blood will become stagnant, leading to blood clots, or the valve failure. Get up and move once an hour, and turn your ankle or shake your leg if it is not feasible. In order to protect the health of leg blood vessels, you need to take care of high blood pressure, diabetes, and diet. Walking is the best exercise for blood vessels. Professor Kim Hyang-kyung of Jungang Hospital said, Foreign countries are so effective as to apply health insurance to walking programs for people with vascular diseases, adding, Even if the legs are sore, walking improves the ability of exercise and makes blood vessels stronger.

The hospital sees the possibility of infection as low because the infant intensive care unit is basically a patient isolation system, but police investigation concluded that the attack resulted in the safety of 12 newborns who were accompanied by an infection were lit in an intensive care unit. Hong Jung-ik, director of the crisis management division, explained that "" it is necessary to ensure that the health of other infants who are in or out of the country is OK, and that new infections are present and tests are conducted.

The core improvement of the shared spaces at Nakwon Shopping Center is the transformation of four rooftop parks. The goal is to create a landmark view of downtown Seoul that will allow you to see Mount Bukak, Changdeokgung, Jongmyo, Dongdae, Dongdaemun and Namsan on the fifth and 16th floors. The rooftop on the sixth floor will be equipped with a kitchen garden to provide farming experience to the city. The fourth floor is a theme performance hall that connects with theaters and musical instruments and is open to the public. A separate design is underway for the lower part of the paradise's shopping center, which has been criticized for preventing the flow of walking. It plans to convert dark spaces into spaces that can attract the current population of Insa-dong.When building the rooftop observatory of a paradise mall, the architect's office suggested ways to reduce noise and install exclusive elevators to accommodate the residents of apartments.【 Seoul-Newsis &amp; ' 26 ; Seoul Paradise Shopping Center : A bird's eye view is improved.

"Counterpoint Research at the market research firm Advantage Point, announced on July 17, 2017, that Samsung ranked first with 45 % of the German smartphone market. It was an increase of 8 percent from the previous year. Apple ranked second with 30 percent, followed by Whaway, Motorola and Sony. The top five brands account for more than 90 percent of the German smartphone market, according to a report.Three of Germany's top five bestseller lists were Samsung, with the Galaxy S8 accounting for 13 percent of the market. While other brands are concentrated on a specific price point, Samsung is maintaining its market lead based on a portfolio across all price lines.Apple is waiting for the iPhone X, so the demand for the iPhone 8 is lower than for the iPhone 7. However, one can expect the full season effect of the year ahead, as most smartphones sold in Germany are in the premium segment of more than $ 500.Smartphones penetration in Germany is constantly growing, with 96 percent of all cell phones sold in the third quarter being smartphones."" Samsung currently ranks first in all price categories for smartphones in Germany, and to remain competitive, Samsung's brand image will need to be strengthened rather than improved its current competitive edge, "" said Park Jin-seok, economist at Coung-point Research. It is time to consider introducing a separation of premium and mid-sized brands, such as Huaway ` strategy to separate brands by price range, explained Kang.Please subscribe to "" IdalI "" from the Naver-Finance Network at (honnezo@edaily.co.kr)Based on research accumulated in the world by WID.World, the report by five famous economists, including French economist Professor Thomas Piketty, has shown an increasingly wide gap between the rich and the poor, ' ▽ Professionalization of Income for the Top 1 % Rich and Poor = Since 1980 to 2016, the gap in income and wealth between the world's top 1 % in Paris (Red Line) has been substantially increased, and the share of the lower 50 % in the world's first academic world has actually grown. The "" rich "" phenomenon has intensified among the wealthy. The upper 0.1 % (7.6 million) of the wealth was accounted for by 13 % of the total, and the upper 0.001 % (76,000) was taken by 4 % of the total. This means that the growth rate of wealth returned to the middle class between the bottom 50 percent and upper 1 percent is so small that it is almost zero. Overall, the report pointed out that the top 10 percent kept squeezing the other 90 percent, including the top 40 percent of the middle class. As the wealth's share grows, it is squeezing the middle class as well as the poor. The world's middle class (top red line), which was similar to the richest people in 1980, earned more than 40 percent of the income. Blue Line is becoming more and more profitable, and very few of the top 0.1 % or 0.01 % (purple and green lines) are living on income than the middle class.[WID.world-uniform inequality report] The level of income gap between the rich and the poor is highest in what is called an underdeveloped or developing country. In 2016, the top 10 percent of national income was in the Middle East with 61 percent, followed by India, Brazil (55 percent) and sub-Saharan African countries (54 percent). These countries, which had no "" egalitarian propulsion "" at all since World War II, have maintained the lowest levels of inequality since then. However, the gap between the U.S. and Canada (47 percent), Russia (46 percent), and China (41 percent), the world's biggest and most advanced nations, is wide apart, but expanding at a very rapid pace. In the U.S., the share of the top one percent rich in 1980 was 22 percent, but in 2014, it jumped to 39 percent. In Europe, the share of the top 10 percent in 2016 was relatively low at 37 percent, but the gap has been growing at a slower pace. Britain is far from being the only country on the continent, including France. What the top 10 % of the world's richest people took from income across the globe in 2016 : European (37 %), China (41 %), Russia (46 %), and the United States and Canada (47 %) took from the top China, in particular, had the lowest wealth in 1980, but has seen a surge since the 1990s.[WID.world-uniform ' inequality report] There are several causes of income inequality expanding and each country is slightly different. While the value of assets, such as stocks and real estate, has soared, tax and other policies have also operated to the benefit of the rich, having the biggest influence. The benefits were most enjoyed by the wealthy, especially the so-called ' super-son, ' the top 0.1 percent. For example, the value of the holding assets of the world's richest man, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, was $ 33 billion (about 36 trillion won) last year, but now it is $ 98.8 billion (about 108 trillion won). The combined wealth of the world's five richest people, including Bill Gates, is $ 425 billion (about 463 trillion won). At the same time, the portion of the richest people in the top 1 percent of the world who earn 20 percent of income will grow to 24 percent by 2050, while the lowest half will have nine percent of the income. They warned that if inequality is left as it is, it could lead to political, economic, and social unrest. Furthermore, inequality is not inevitable, stressing that it can and should be reduced through policies and institutions. For this, the government should gradually increase income tax, increase capital gains taxes on fire income, and prevent the concealment of tax-avoidance funds in the world's wealth, while actively increasing wages and redistributing the public sector.Income Inequality in Korea The income of the top 10 % (upper red line) and the top 1 % (blue line) of the wealthy have continued to grow.Meanwhile, the summary of the report released by WID.World does not contain the Korean situation and there was no announcement of the results of Korean scholars ' study at the Paris Academic Conference.However, two Korean economists are participating in WID.World, and some income inequality data are included in the status section of each country's website. According to the interpriser data, the share of the richest people in 1996 and the poorest 10 percent in the nation rose to 7.3 percent and 32.6 percent respectively, respectively, and the gap continued to grow by 12.3 percent to 2012.

"[Hankyoreh] [Saturday edition] news analysis why? ‘The capital city of Jerusalem Declaration’ national residing in the background of immigrants from Jordan, Egypt, the Middle East, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 12 days.Donald Trump in front of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul protesting against the ‘The capital city of Jerusalem Declaration’ rally of condemnation of the American president holding. Shin So-yeong ▶ viator@hani.co.kr a reporter last six days (local time) Donald Trump announced, “as is the official capital of Israel to Jerusalem.” the United States president.Jerusalem, since the problem has emerged as issues of international political arena. With the assessment that "" The Gates of Hell has opened, "" concerns are growing over fueling the already unstable situation in the Middle East. We have looked into the historical background of Jerusalem. 30 Jewish, Muslim and Christian urban poor have a long history in between 3 billion of the world's population control is ‘faith center’ and 47 years into a U.N. resolution in international law.‘sympathetic’ with the leader of the Middle East Saudi domestic political crisis that will transform the Trump ‘neutral ground’ ambitions reflected simmering the Middle East ‘Jerusalem, an advocate of recovery’ voice.Have a sense of political instability to Trump the president of the ‘The capital city of Jerusalem Declaration’ smell of gunpowder, in many places. "" The U.S. decision has become an unusual challenge for Muslim countries and will provoke violence in the Middle East, "" warned the Islamic Cooperation (OIC), a group of 57 countries that have assembled with Islam as their state religion. In addition to the Arabic federation, which includes 22 countries from the Middle East and Africa, major Western countries, including Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, expressed their opposition to the declaration. Thousands of people in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Pakistan continued to protest, burning the Stars and Stripes. Less than 900,000 people in the world, a barren city that can not afford to farm, or a humble city whose geopolitical importance far falls short of Damascus or Baghdad? The Trump declaration is a major issue to look at from a few complex aspects. First is the symbolism of Jerusalem, second is the argument of ownership in international law, third is the political background of the declaration, and fourth is the understanding of the American evangelism of the slogan of ' recovering Jerusalem '.* Press to magnify. Where does the special quality of Jerusalem come from among the many holy cities in the fantasy? Of course, the answer should be found in the long history of Jerusalem, where religions have crossed paths. `` Jerusalem has been the capital of Israel for 3,000 years, '' Prime Minister Netanyahu, who recently visited France, said in a statement, `` It's accessible to anyone who reads the Bible. '' However, no ' one-of-a-kind ' ruler of the city has ever been in history. If you divide Jerusalem into three thousand years ' history, it was about 550 years under Jewish rule, and about 400 years under Christian rule. The rest was ruled by foreign powers. As in any other town, the owners of Jerusalem have changed a great deal. The war always left the city in ruins, but the destroyer was also the new builder. Saladin, the Muslim hero who conquered Jerusalem in the 12th century, said this. Jerusalem is nothing. But it is all : "" In reality, the barren Jerusalem that is stained with red blood is nothing, but in reality, Jerusalem is always the Holy City, the heavenly city. Jerusalem is the only city in the imagination to hold such a transcendental position. Did you say imagination is always bigger than reality? That is why pilgrims from all over the world come to Korea so many times. But the holy place of Jerusalem, where holy pilgrims flock to it, was not all about the joyful worship and admiration. Long ago in Byzantine times, the city lacked water, dirty baths, and the gate's security and administrator's administration were messy and just loved bribes. All the pilgrims who went to this town knew it. For a long time Jerusalem was a holy city of unclean, money-smelling pilgrims. In the late 18th century, as pilgrimages to the Holy Land became a commercial activity, gift stores lined up around the Catholic Church. Among the pilgrims, sculptures of crosses and church models made of olive tree or coral, glass from Hebron, and beads of pearls and beads were popular. Even today, the narrow alleys of Jerusalem are packed with shops that attracts pilgrims. * Press to magnify. Before international law remained as a "" neutral zone, "" Jews removed from Palestine 2000 years ago and were swept along wherever human footsteps could be. They lived as slaves under oppression and persecution, but they never forgot Jerusalem. To the Jews, Jerusalem was their mother's womb's resting place. Ironically, if it were not for Jerusalem, they would not have survived. Until 1947 when a United Nations resolution was created to create a Jewish state. But for Jews who returned after 2,000 years, Jerusalem was by no means an empty land. In Europe, the Jews were the victims of Hitler's, and the Palestinian territories were the refugees ' sanctuary, but Israel's independence (founding) was nothing but disaster for Palestinians. Palestinians have become, in short, "" victims of victims. "" Yesterday's victims were now perpetrators ; yesterday's David was now Goliath. "" Jewish liberation was not just achieved, it was done on the remains of another nation, "" said Edward Said of Palestine. Shoah (Holocaust. Jewish genocide) and Nakhba (founded Israel in 1947) are twins. Jerusalem is a holy place for both Muslims and Christians, as well as a de facto residential area for Arabs. In 1947, the United Nations "" forced partition "" Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, but only Jerusalem remained "" neutral "" under international law. Since then, no country has explicitly considered Jerusalem the capital of Israel and has had an embassy in Jerusalem. Trump's case revealed ‘The two face’, Trump and accusations of breach of international law is the president brought, why did pushed the Declaration of the capital Jerusalem. Why is he waging an all-out war against the world's people who are trying to uphold international law and peace? Trump may tell who it goes to the president often moving by careful calculation, strategists and unpredictable nature of the organic character with evaluation at the same time.to exist The statement is seen as a clearer example of Trump's two faces. First, let's take a look at the domestic politics. Critics say the government has touched on the Achilles ' heel of international politics to reverse the current situation still mired in lingering approval ratings and scandals. In addition, the analysis should be accompanied by a background of agreement between Saudi Arabia's young leader Bin Salman and the Middle East's reorganization. The Saudi new leader's ambition to become the host of the Middle East by weakening his Iranian oriented siabelt, and Trump's understanding of turning the situation around with the unity of Jewish forces in the United States, is exquisite. Since the report said that Saudi requested an attack on Hezbollah in secret when it secretly sounded the need to improve relations with Israel, it is safe to say that the three-way link linking Saudi Arabia to Israel and the United States has been confirmed. It is hard to deny Trump's latest declaration, ending with the faith of Jerusalem's recovery-minded conservative Christian faith in Trump. The so called Jerusalem Recoveryist saw the light of day "" when the Jews returned to Jerusalem and the last condition of the Messiah was fulfilled. That is, when the Jews return to their homeland and Jerusalem recovers, they began to believe that it was a sign of the arrival of the Christian Messiah. Recollectivism in Jerusalem has become the cornerstone of American evangelism today and is the preserve of Trump's supporters. This idea of a return to the Jewish faith and the advent of the Messiah was also an expression of America's expansionist foreign policy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is worth remembering that it was time for Western powers, including the U.K., to set up a consulate in Jerusalem and add a new meaning to the city. This belief is also in conflict with the belief that since St. Augustus, Jews have been forced out of Jerusalem by God, and that the Jewish tradition of wandering is evidence that Jesus ' claim is true. Because Jesus ' innocence naturally meant the guilt of Jews. Today, Jerusalem is not a big city with a population of 900,000. Many Jews live in a mixture of Christians and Muslims. Each of them walks down the streets in a different way, and leads a busy life with different beliefs and colors. On the intricate maze of streets, the Orthodox Jews wearing black monk hats, black durumas, long black beards and strutting turbans of the streets, and the religious turbans and porchands of white torchas are dressed The town, with its narrow alleys and noisy honky-whistling wheels, is considered the center of their faith by about half, or 3 billion people worldwide. On Saturday, the Sabbath day of the Jews, no cars are running on the streets, and the cacophony of prayers and the cantaloupe of the old church rings softly from the loud speakers of the mosque who pray five times a day. Sometimes with greed and valor, it is also the place where the law of exclusion and retaliation leads to the loss of blood to die and kill. Despite the stark reality of international politics forcing the sacrifice of one side for profit, the declaration is a recipe for disaster in the hard-to-cure Middle East. America's priority is to be America's isolationist,"
"In the end, the interests of the U.S. and the public interest of the international community are not compatible. In the contrast of the lives of the people, the people of Jerusalem uniformly love the long breathing and throbbing pulse of Jerusalem in this worm-eating city. It is now full of heavily armed Israeli soldiers and a time bomb that may explode, but it is disturbing as if one day different faiths, different colors will freely coexist, and in harmony, until all are able to coexist peacefully.

[Subscription for People and Animals] [Kakao Talk] [ⓒ Hangyeong Shinbuk : Uncontrolled and redistributed] Jeju = Newsis and Woojang-ho, a reporter at Samsung Elementary School in Jeju learned from local swimming center 2017.09.11. woo1223@newsis.com The number of safety education experts will increase to 10,000 by 2022. The government announced its "" 1st basic plan for public safety education "" on July 18 jointly with 25 concerned ministries, including the Ministry of Public Administration and Security, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The main idea is to promote safety education in stages for five years until 2022, with the general public at the center of safety related workers and school education. The related central and local governments will push for the 2018 National Security Education Implementation Plan based on the basic plan. The basic plan was designed to "" prevent disasters and improve the people's ability to cope with accidents "" under the slogan of "" safe society for the respect of people and life. "" To that end, the government will push ahead with 15 tasks in six major areas by 2022. First of all, the survival swimming of elementary school students will be extended from the current 3rd to 5th grade to the entire grade by 2020 to enhance the safety capabilities of water sports, which increases the risk of children's accidents. In the schools, students should receive safety education based on experiences for 51 hours or more per year. The goal is to raise the satisfaction level of school safety education from the current 75 to 80. The institution reinforced the safety education of 43 departments, including the Ministry of Industry and Energy, the Ministry of Sexual Harassment and Prevention of Sexual Violence (Ministry of Gender Equality and Family). In addition, 22 new safety experience centers were built throughout the country (8 for the Ministry of Public Administration and Security, 11 for the Ministry of Education, 1 for Transport and Transport, and 2 for the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries) by 2021. The plan is to increase the number of students who experienced training annually from 2.89 million (5.6 %) last year to 7.03 million (7.23 million) by 2022. Mobile safety experience training is conducted in areas that do not have safety experience facilities. The Ministry of Health and Security operates children's safety experience classrooms for 350,000 people in 100 cities, counties and districts for five years. The Ministry of Industry, Industry and Energy conducts electricity and gas safety experiences, and the National Maritime Police Agency implements marine accidents and survival experiences. We will train 10,000 experts in public safety education by 2022. The safety education staff has not been managed by experts, but will be registered in the database and serve as professional instructors in safety education institutions and lifelong education institutes. The institution started and developed safety education courses, developed and developed ‘ Safety Education Characterization College ’ to be used as a regular curriculum, and newly appointed ‘ Safety Education Professional ’ country title. Safety education institutions were also designated and fostered in 17 cities and provinces across the country. There are currently 68 education programs for the safety areas required from infants to elderly. The government develops and distributes life cycle safety education contents and programs tailored to the existing 68 areas, as well as the handicapped, foreigners, and the elderly. Minister of Public Administration and Security Kim Bu-kyum said, "" Safe education can protect one's safety and life in the event of a disaster, "" adding, "" It is not just the people's ability to participate and help the neighbors as a volunteer. "" limj@newsis.com> The Bank of Korea's floating mortgage rate rose to a record 4.6 % on the back of a sharp rise in the Copix, led by a sharp rise in the Seoul Economic [COFIX] Copix (Capital Cost Index). Moreover, the recent U.S. base rate increase by 0.25 % and the Bank of Korea's decision last month to apply a base rate increase to reduce deposit rates by 0.2 to 0.3 % are the reasons why the government's time is on the rise. Kookmin Bank saw its new key interest rate rise from 3.11 to 4.31 percent to 3.26 to 4.46 percent, and Shinhan Bank saw its new key interest rate rise to 2.82 percent. The Korea Federation of Banks announced yesterday that its new supply base, Copix, increased by 0.15 percentage point to its highest level in two years and seven months, at 1.77 percent. Most of the remaining banks saw a 0.15 percent increase. The bank saw its lending rate for new copy-controlled loans rise 0.15 percentage point to 2.98 to 4.57 percent from 2.83 to 4.42 percent, pushing the maximum rate to 4.6 percent. As the commercial banks ` lending rates are on a steady rise, the financial authorities will keep an eye on whether banks will expand their profits by adjusting their additional rates. For example, it is expected to check every week whether the additional rate is adjusted by adjusting the target profit rate, which is net profit margin, and then encourage the government to readjust if the basis of the increase is not correct.Additional rates are determined by the banks on a voluntary basis, combining risks and costs depending on individual bank situations. It consists of the cost of business, risk, liquidity, credit premium, capital cost adjustment rate, and target return. In particular, the target return is the real profit margin, excluding costs, when the bank calculates the interest rates. Banks have been criticized for their surprising performance in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis by raising the key interest rate to add to the flat rate and not lowering lending rates. According to data submitted by the Financial Supervisory Service by Je Yoon-kyung, the Office of the Dubul Councilman of the National Assembly, 10 out of 15 banks, including commercial, provincial and special banks, raised their household credit target rates by increasing their profit margins.

The prosecution has repeatedly refused to issue arrest warrants amid controversies over the summons of the emperor to investigate corruption.Then in October, the investigation was turned over. The National Intelligence Service's General Services Resolution Task Force sent an internal report to the prosecution on the alleged secret reporting by former NIS Director Choo Myung-ho.The report clearly showed that Woo used the NIS to investigate the whereabouts of a presidential special inspector, Lee Seok-soo, who was investigating alleged irregularities in his stomach.Documents containing secret investigation details of former Commissioner Lee's background were obtained, and documents requiring the Office of Civil Affairs and Public Affairs to report to the NIS within five days of examining the progressive education superintendent.NIS officials also backed up the document by a statement that Woo had given orders. Prosecutors have secured a wide range of evidence, including relevant statements on the NIS documents and phone calls.Based on this, he sought a third arrest warrant, and eventually, Wu was arrested. Prosecutors also acknowledged that the documents had become important investigative material, declaring it was the final straw.Prosecutors plan to concentrate their investigation on suspicions that were raised the day after tomorrow."
""" You're not paying for the year-end tax, Stuffit ~ "" 2017 is just around 10 days away. Office workers are likely to forget about the remaining 10 days of work when they finish their work after a long delay.However, there is something you should keep within 10 days even if you are busy and tired. As most of the deductions are judged on December 31 each year according to the end-of-year settlement and the end-year tax law, they should be completed by the end of December without passing the year. If you take good care of it for the remaining 10 days, you can get a bonus of February or 13 next year, but if you leave it busy, you can get a tax bomb from January. ■ Let's take a close look at the standard of income and human deductions. The largest proportion of income tax deductions are definitely human deductions. The government acknowledges the obligation to support the tax by giving a part of their income deductions for the support of their family.Each dependent member is entitled to a deduction of 1.5 million won, and the number of recipients is unlimited. In addition, the tax credit is a key key factor to receiving bonuses in March, as the spending on medical care, credit cards, and education can be deducted from the beneficiaries ` tax.The personal deductions are based on the person and spouse, children (including adopted children) and siblings who are living together under the age of 20 or over, parents and grandparents of the spouse and themselves.The conditions of dependents are less than one million won per year. Parents admit to being a dependent on their children, even if they do not live at the same address. It includes grandparents, artisans, and mother-in-law.In particular, families with disabilities can get an additional 2 million won deducted. As the standard of the disabled is larger than the welfare law for the disabled, it is advisable to check them. In general, it recognizes patients with incurable diseases, such as cancer, dementia, and leukemia, even when they are not disabled. You can get a certificate of disability for end-of-year settlement from the hospital.If the spouse dies due to an unexpected accident, a deduction of the year can be made. If you divorce, you can not get a spouse's personal allowance. A spouse who is on maternity leave is subject to a personal deduction if his or her total salary does not exceed five million won. Child leave given by the country. Vacation pay before and after leaving the country amounts to non-taxable income. ■ Even if you sign up for an annuity savings package or a subscription in December, the tax refund and settlement income tax deduction at the end of the month usually give back the tax as if you spent the money. With the year coming to a close, it is not a wise choice to spend more on deductions. It is good to look at financial products that can be deducted while saving. Representative product is housing subscription savings and pension savings. You can get a deduction if you join in December.In general housing subscription savings, the owner of a home away from home can get an income deduction of 40 % (960,000 won) of the payment of 2.4 million won or less with an annual income of 70 million won or less. Since the deposit money can be deducted only when submitting a check to financial institutions for the residence, the deposit must be submitted by December 31.Pension savings will be deducted from the 4 million won limit of annual payments. Those who earn less than 55 million won are deducted according to the tax rates of 16.5 percent (660,000 won) and 13.2 percent (530,000 won) respectively. However, the annual salary of those who earn is more than 120 million won per annum or more.The dog doll retirement pension (IRP) will be deducted from its tax amount to 7 million won. However, the amount of tax deductions from pension savings is excluded first. For example, an IRP dog doll can get a tax credit of up to 5 million won for paying 2 million won in pension savings.Because the tax deduction limit and rate of deduction depend on the total wage, it is advantageous for working couples to pay in the name of their spouses with lower income. Since these financial instruments have no monthly or quarterly limit of payment, it is recommended that you make a temporary payment to cover the maximum deduction when you have additional money. However, this point should be noted that if one subscribes to a tax credit deduction product to receive end-of-year payments and cancels the product at a later date, he or she can make more money than the deducted tax amount.■ If the year-end tax credit card, small - and medium-sized enterprises ' income tax deductions, young men and women, and senior citizens ' tax rates are found in small - and medium-sized enterprises, 70 percent of income tax will be deducted for three years.Persons aged 15 years or older (excluding military service period) and those who are exempt from paying income tax for the first three years at the time of signing a contract are allowed to work for small businesses (e.g., those who are exempt from paying income tax, and those who are disabled or have experienced separation from jobs) should work for small businesses As they are not old enough to serve in the military, anyone who has served in the military for six years will be targeted at age 35.Tax reduction of 70 % is substantial. For example, if the income tax already paid by the office worker is 100,000 won this year, and the tax amount decided after the year-end tax is 200,000 won, A should make up the difference of 100,000 won. If the tax cut is 70 percent, the tax amount decided to be reduced by 60,000 won to 40,000 won. The tax bomb in March will turn into a bonus in March.If your age meets the target conditions, you should check with the company you work for to see if you are benefiting.■ If you buy a monthly rent, you can get a maximum tax credit of 750,000 won per month.The maximum monthly limit of 75 million won (7.5 million won) per month is the maximum limit of monthly rent of 75 million won (7.5 million won) for workers who live in a 1,000-square-square ㎡ or less house with three homeless employees. Tax deductions are possible without the consent of the owners, and employees need to prepare a copy of their resident registration, a copy of the lease agreement, and monthly payment documents (monthly cash receipt, bank transfer confirmation, and a copy of the bank's remittance account) to submit to the company.Starting this year, taxpayers can get monthly tax deductions even if they sign a lease contract. In addition, the court added an inspector to the house to be deducted.However, the rental agreement and the address on the certified resident registration must be identical to receive monthly deductions. It is best to take the monthly rent credit because you can not get it unless you apply.Cash receipts, with a 30 percent tax reduction rate, are very filial at the end of the year. When you want to automatically issue a cash receipt with a mobile phone number, you must register the mobile phone number via the National Tax Service home tax (NTS) website or ARS. If the number has been changed this year, it is necessary to check whether the previous and current numbers are registered properly.If an automatic details inquiry is not available from the National Tax Service's end-of-year settlement simplification service, receipts should be kept separately.yongyong@fnnews.com Yonghwao, reporter of the world's most goal-butting story, "" fnpas, "" you can see on the inside of celebrity news. ▽ Introduction of a drugstore for the Public Night! = (Yonhap News Agency) Kim Joo-hyung : Members of the Korean Pharmaceutical Association are attending a nationwide meeting to block the sale of convenience stores in front of Hyoja Security Center in Seoul on July 17. Kim Ji-hun, a reporter for the Seoul Yonhap News Agency, held a rally in front of the Hyoja Security Center near Cheong Wa Dae on July 17 and extended its policy of selling convenience stores. The association said, The side effects of store sales have continued to increase, and the ministry should focus instead on expanding its intelligent sales policies, even though the restore`s illegal activities have exceeded the dangerous levels. The ""Moon Jae-in, the government that still life adopted national policy, strengthen safety and protect public health by past governments an evil of long standing policy learning."" and "" a convenience store.Right to represent the interests of chaebol sales and distribution of medicines and public health threat claimed. And if we expand the items without assessing whether convenience store medicines are safe, the damage will go to the public, said an intellectual damage caused by the growing sales of many medicines, not by improvement in health but by misuse. It is the pharmacist's duty to ask whether medicines are safe, he said. The pharmaceutical association reinforced the responsibility of introducing public late night pharmacies to resolve gaps in consultation between public holidays and late night hours ▲ for ordering specialized medicines and emergency room and enforcing the duty of connecting pharmacies and lawmakers to reduce overcrowding.

"In addition, a massive gynecology clinic and a university hospital that were transferred due to an accident of cesarean sections found to have been contaminated with cerebrity-related lesions. It is reported that the hospital bled while preparing for the transfusion while performing surgery, and that transferring to other hospitals was too late. However, the university hospitals that received patients were also slow to act, which led to accidents. The court decided to recognize the two hospitals ' malpractice and compensate them 800 million won. According to the court on June 17, A, 32, went to an OBJECT Hospital in Incheon to give birth in June 2015. The hospital injected oxytocin, the fertility drug, and tried to induce labor. However, an emergency situation occurred, such as a reduction in the fetal heart rate from 80 to 90 times per minute, where placenta early delamination (falling before birth) was suspected and an emergency cesarean operative surgery was performed with the consent of the guardian. The delivery was successful, but the mother showed symptoms of hematuria. Although the bleeding was minimal, the gynecologist was unable to prepare the blood needed for the transfusion. A was not transferred to a nearby university hospital until an hour and 25 minutes later. The measures were similar in nearby university hospitals. Although doctors were able to learn of the bleeding, the hospital proceeded to operate to stop the bleeding in four hours and 10 minutes. On that day, he was in a state of shock. Although he underwent treatment and recovered after being transferred to a large hospital in Seoul, he had a level 3 lesion in his brain. Brain lesion disorder refers to a physical disorder caused by organic lesions in the brain, such as cerebral palsy, traumatic brain damage, and stroke. A computer programmer retired from his company and is undergoing rehabilitation. A family filed a suit against a large gynecologist and university hospital in 2015 and fought for damages for two years. In the process, the gynecologist was also confirmed to have had a medical accident during the operation. The company`s left vulvar artery was damaged although it is not commonly damaged during cesarean operations, the court acknowledged the malpractice. We did not prepare blood individually despite the need for blood transfusion, and it was too late, he said. University Hospital stated, "" Although I could have known of blood loss from the blood vessels, such as the uterine arteries, I did not take any surgical measures to stop the bleeding immediately, "" and added, "" We did not take proper measures.

"The Kumho Tire Committee held a press conference in front of Kumho Tire Plant in Gwangju Monday morning to demand that the Kumho Tire's restructuring plan be implemented to reduce its wages, and that SK Tire & Rubber Company should normalize its management.SK Corp., under a growing pressure to provide new funds, officially concluded its position that it is not considering taking over, but the situation was quite serious after the storm. This means that the market sees the acquisition of Kumho Tire by large Korean companies as a shortcut to normalize the company.According to Kumho Tire on July 17, its Gwangju headquarters is scheduled to hold talks on the June 19, 2016, party-related talks. Creditors will also share the report and discuss it. The management is expected to ask the union to agree on a self-regulating measure, indicating an impending decision on a restructuring package.If the union refuses to accept the wording suggested by the management, the creditors will likely turn to the "" P "" plan. In this case, wage cuts and job cuts are inevitable, and there is a danger of escalating tension in the restructuring process.As SK's takeover was announced, Kumho Tire's stock price soared. It appears that the expectation of an early normalization of management could be reflected if the Korean conglomerates sounded the news of the acquisition before the restructuring was announced. In fact, just before SK's takeover, Kumho Tires ' stock price rose 29.85 percent to 5220 won at the beginning of the month. SK shares closed at 4455 won, up 10.82 percent from the previous day, although it denied the acquisition review.However, others analyzed that SK's acquisition is unlikely to be realized because Kumho Tires ' union and management are suffering from a difficulty in agreeing to the wording of the normalization bill. That is why it would be difficult for candidates who fail to reach an agreement on labor reform, management and other issues to take on all the burden.Industry watchers say Kumho Tire Co. is the right way to normalize operations for Korean conglomerates, but the labor union and management are reluctant to come up with a self-regulating package and the Chinese factory owners face growing risk.Meanwhile, Kumho Tire requested the union to cooperate with the measure, which includes a 30 percent pay cut (based on the total amount) on Tuesday, an 82 percent reduction in the regular staff, and a 191 laid-off workers. Refusing to go ahead with the plan, the union remained firm, saying, "" If we go ahead with the plan, we will start a struggle between the Industrial Bank of Korea and Cheong Wa Dae. ""To a report!

""" If you live in poverty, you are not able to live in poverty, "" Park Byung-gi, a stock farm owner who killed 953 cattle in February. No, when walking through it, they struggle to look away at the distant mountains.The grave that is covered with dark vinyl from hanu farm Tanbu-myeon, Boeun-gun, has 378 hanu (Korean native cattle) that he raised as his child. Ten months ago, a new grave was built overnight when foot-and-mouth disease hit the farm. At that time, he stayed awake all night watching the slaughter. Still, I can not forget the pitiful sight of cows with their scared faces as if they were intuitive to die.◇ Ask of a like child and fail to show up in the neighborhood, leaving a shadow of death on his farm on February 9. It has been four days since he heard of foot-and-mouth disease at a dairy farm in a nearby town. As a result of the virus attack, he locked the door of the farm as usual, and found a cow showing abnormal symptoms while feeding the cow. She was a little van, but she refused to eat, and then went back to the corner and drenched. As a result, the medical authorities immediately reported the incident to the quarantine authorities, and the kid inspection and the examination proceeded immediately. Then, a bolt from the blue was judged as being foot-and-mouth disease in a few hours. As people in white suits broke in and closed all roads to the outside, the inside of the farm was thrown into chaos. Seven of the same cage, including infected cattle, were destroyed for the first time. There are two more hanu farms by their parents ' names next to his farm. It is lined up within a 150 meter radius and is like a farm, with workers frequently coming and going. The authorities expanded antibody formation to all three, and decided to kill them when the results did not meet expectations. Two days after the disease was declared, 378 animals were killed.After burying everything in the ground, such as the giant cattle grave Saeng, he remained trapped for a while on a farm. The quarantine manuals were also to block access to the farms, but the guilt of bringing a vicious disease to the farm did not give him the courage of his neighbors. Lee recalled the time when everyday life was hell, and could not even sleep at night because she heard hearing from an empty congratulatory address.◇ It has already been over 10 months since foot-and-mouth disease broke out on the ground breaking out of the livestock industry in only 9 days. The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease on Feb. 5 left the community in fear, devastating seven farms of Korean cattle and cows in Tanbu-Maro-myeon in just nine days. 953 cattle were buried, including preventive slaughter, and livestock transportation was restricted for more than a month, causing the livestock base to collapse. As time went by, control posts that blocked the entrance to the village and quarantine facilities that were emitting murky disinfectant were gone. Farm farms, once noisy due to the cows ' plaintive cry and the heavy machinery's burial work, have become quiet again. But farmers are still unable to escape the pain. Many people feel the pressure of money due to their long lost jobs and feel guilty of failing to save their lives. Farms affected by foot-and-mouth disease need to pass a virus test three times before they can be refered. Lee has been steadily feeding the calf since June, after a three month hiatus. "" I have spent 280 calves by combining government rewards (80 percent of my small bills) and bank debt so far, "" he said, adding, "" It's very nice to see that the soulless congratulatory address again fills up with calf warmth, but I'm glad to see it's too late. ""Seo (53), who raises 300 Korean beef from cattle near the calves that he has reintroduced to the farms, underwent foot-and-mouth disease and increased the quarantine facility drastically. It has turned sterilizing agent spray into a high performance device and has new quarantine facilities for cars. He also buried four Korean cattle in an open space in front of a farm in February. `` Thank God it was over before we lost four, but since then, we have been so attentive to prevention that we have cut off our neighbors, '' he said.◇ Cattle price…Somethings of farmers who can not afford to get over their money are still shocked. As a result of an investigation by Boeun-gun, two out of 11 farms have not yet received calves. The government has not compensated enough, and the price of the calf has increased since spring. While funding for the meal is also problematic, it could take at least two to five years for non-feedbarrel cattle to get back to their farm, given that they are being shipped out after 30 months of age. Authorities have become more responsive to prevent the recurrence of foot-and-mouth disease. Boeun-gun completed the vaccination process in February and June against all Korean cattle and 22,000 cows raised at 753 farms in the jurisdiction of the county in November. All farms were vaccinated simultaneously, and officials were assigned to each farm to take pictures of the shots to prevent inoculations or omissions. As a result, the antibody formation rate of cattle in the region was 100 percent. In general, it is reported that when more than 80 percent of antibodies are formed, the risk of foot-and-mouth disease is sharply decreased. Shin Joong-soo, head of animal protection at Bo-eun`s livestock farm, explained, "" We have to keep track of all cattle in the pipeline to prevent the virus from entering the area again, and to keep all livestock vehicles in and out of the area under quarantine.

"If Park Sang-jun's Guogation's Welcome to the Space Launch of the Korea Space Navigation Association 1959 - On TV, I saw a foreign documentary about the development process of spaceships at NASA. In the middle, a NASA Asian scientist explained to me, and his name was Park Cheol. I felt proud and proud of myself as a young child, guessing that I must be Korean. Meanwhile, I can remember that making rockets or participating in space development is difficult in our country. It was only a few years before the name, Park Cheol, was re-recognized a long time later, even in the 21st century. While looking at cultural and scientific feeds, I learned that the Korea Space Navigation Association was founded surprisingly in 1959. And the journal's first issue also featured an article by astronaut Park Chul-chul. The Korea Space Navigation Association was not a group of amateur athletes. It was the first group of Korean aerospace developers to have a wide array of academic and defense officials. The journal contained a series of articles full of formulas and terminologies, such as rocket launch trajectory and engine fuel, and featured messages from various walks of life to celebrate the institution's launch. According to the magazine, Korea was poised to develop its own spacecraft anytime soon. Separately from the Korea Space Navigation Association, the Korean Student Space Science Association was founded in 1959. They attempted to design and build their own rockets, and held lectures by the U.S. Information Service and others to the public. Sputnik shock, which led the Soviet Union to hit the world by launching the world's first satellite Sputnik in 1957, has also sparked keen interest in space development in Korea. Korean Space Navigation Association Journal [Space Science > Table 1 (1959). Why didn't the excitement over space development continue as such? That is because rockets can be used as missiles and are a powerful weapon system. So the United States aggressively intervened in the development of rockets in Korea or Japan at that time, and wrote a policy to control the transfer of related technologies and contain them. Now, as North Korea now shows, it announced that it has launched an artificial satellite, but when it loaded the rocket into its tower with a bomb rather than a satellite, it becomes an intercontinental ballistic missile. Japan succeeded in 1955 when Professor Itokawa University of Tokyo successfully launched a "" pencil rocket, "" or a tiny rocket the size of a pencil, that was the start of a Japanese rocket. But as Japan continued to develop its own rockets, the United States urged it to stop researching solid rockets that were easy to use as weapons, while proposing and pushing through the move of liquid rocket technology. Since then, Japan has continued to develop liquid rocket technology, making it a country that now has its own satellite rockets. Meanwhile, Korea had a record of success in launching rockets at the Defense Ministry in 1959 and even at Inha University, however, the rocket development was virtually stopped with U.S. pressure. Then, during the Park Chung-hee administration, the U.S. secret Agency for Defense Development (ADD) developed rockets during the mid 70s. A senior U.S. diplomat who had noticed at the time visited the Institute of Defense Sciences, but he paid no attention to it without serving lunch on the pretext of having no menu to suit his tastes. However, the study was also stopped altogether when Park Chung-hee died and Chun Doo-hwan came to power in the aftermath of the Oct. 26 attacks. Retrofitted for a long time, Korea`s aerospace engineering research is not on track until the self-developed 75-ton rocket engine experiment ends this month. Naro, the first Korean rocket to successfully launch in 2013, was actually a Russian rocket engine, and could now launch a rocket using purely Korean technology. The Korea Aerospace Research Institute is planning to conduct an experiment next year on a 75-ton Korean rocket engine. Park Chul-seol, a founding member of the Korea Space Navigation Association in 1959, went to the United Kingdom to study aerospace engineering at Seoul National University, where he was invited by scientists from the United States to study the Apollo missions during his stay. He was one of the key players in the development of the space shuttle and also participated in the Jupiter missions. After returning to Korea in 2003, he spent more than 70 years as a visiting professor at KAIST, focusing on nurturing junior students and heading the third comprehensive launch inspection team. While working as a researcher in the U.S., he was sometimes called a spy and underwent hardships, including being questioned by the FBI.
