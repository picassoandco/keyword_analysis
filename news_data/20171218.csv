The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating the possibility of bacterial deaths. Hong Jung-ik, director of the crisis response bureau at the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said on July 18, "" We are investigating whether the three babies who died were still suspected of bacterial infections during a blood culture test. "" Germs from the dead infant were estimated to be ' gram-negative. ' When certain symptoms appeared in the three infants of Ewha's Mokdong Hospital, Ewha's second son, was found to have carried out tests by himself. The other person was reported not to have collected blood because of no symptoms that would have been necessary for examination.Gram-negative bacteria can cause secondary infections in severely affected patients or newborns who are not immune, including respiratory infections and urinary tract infections. Salmonella, the bacterium, and mycobacterium are gram-negative bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria are often found in popular hospitals. According to a study conducted by Korean researchers in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province in 2012, 84.2 percent (64) of 76 samples contained gram-negative bacteria. If a new baby is infected with gram-negative bacteria, it could die from pneumonia or from septic shock. But given that only three out of four newborns have gram-negative bacteria killed, it is not easy to determine what caused the death. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention immediately sent a response team to Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital to conduct an on-site epidemiological study with the Seoul Metropolitan Dynamics Research Institute, Health Environment Research Institute and Yangcheon-gu Community Health Center. Establish a situation room at the site, and perform mandatory records investigation of 16 people who were in neonatal intensive care units, including 4 who died, and monitor for symptoms of all or all 12 children who were discharged from hospital. Medical records for the exchange of deaths are already being secured and analyzed, and the intensive care unit environment and death exchange cases of infant intensive care units are also being examined.Monitoring of symptoms of 12 children discharged or transferred to other hospitals shows that one out of every four discharged patients is hospitalized with flu symptoms for 17 days and one out of every eight babies is under observation for being analgesic. The ministry said it is currently investigating all possibilities of infection or other accidents and will work with related agencies, including the National Institute of Scientific Investigation, to determine the exact cause of death in the future.Hong Jin-soo, a reporter at Ewha Womans University Hospital, recently changed [Twitter] from popular free comic books to free cartoons and redistributes by (www.khan.co.kr), [Unconstrained and re-distributing] Friday evening.President that hospital ... and 17, received 賞, Ewha Womans Univ. Mok-dong Hospital, Yangcheon-gu, Seoul took banner that a citation president the hospital in the lobby.to exist Four newborns were hospitalized in an intensive care unit yesterday evening. On Sept. 17, the Namgang reporter, identified by his family name Nalbulsae, was given sap to a 5-month-old infant when he met with an insect in the hospital. Parents found bugs in the tube of the "" infusion set "" they used for children who were hospitalized with urinary tract infections and reported it to doctors. Although medical equipment manufacturers are primarily responsible for supplying the hospital with a set of sap, the hospital was also criticized for not checking it thoroughly before injecting the sap.Last July, a nurse who worked in an intensive care unit of a newborn at the hospital was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was put on alert. Health authorities conducted a epidemiological study of 166 hospitalized infant intensive care units up to three months before nurses confirmed tuberculosis as being benign with latent tuberculosis. Infected tuberculosis is a state in which tuberculosis has infected but has not actually developed.In 2014, the "" X-Ray Incident "" also erupted. The video showed 578 patients suffering from pyroparalysis were treated with X-rays that changed their sides from late 2013 to April 2014. At that time, 123 patients had to receive treatment on their nostril, which was normal because of the x-ray images on their left and right. As such, the hospital's poor management system is causing suspicions that it may have affected the infant's death. pc@yna.co.kr 6 hours before his death, he conducted a blood culture test ... (May 20, 2007), and confirmed that the exact fungus is confirmed to have been confirmed after, said Shin Jae-woo, a public health official who died at Ewha Womans University Hospital in Seoul on Monday. Gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella and dysentery germs, can cause secondary infections in people with severe immune diseases, such as respiratory infections and urinary tract infections, and are needed to provide strict surveillance measures. An official at the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention said on July 20, "" Three infants who died during a blood culture test said, "" We believe bacteria are suspected. "" Blood culture tests are tests to determine if blood is infected by growing micro-organisms in the blood. Examination takes several days as bacteria need to be cultured. The babies were drawn around 3:00 p.m. on July 16. Doctors ordered tests when symptoms such as low oxygen saturation appeared. One out of four people was not told to inspect. The exchange babies all passed away between 9:32 p.m. and 10:53 p.m., all of whom were aged between 1 hour and 21 minutes. As the accident occurred, four newborns were killed simultaneously, and starting July 17, the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention is sending an immediate response team to the disaster and conducting an epidemiological investigation with the Seoul Metropolitan Government. Medical records for the exchange of deaths are being secured and analyzed, and the patient is being examined by taking samples from the intensive care unit for infants, and from the infant intensive care unit for death. The abnormal symptoms are being monitored for 12 newborns who were discharged from the hospital or moved to another hospital right after the accident. One out of four people were hospitalized on July 17 due to cold symptoms, and one out of eight who were discharged from the hospital was found to be suffering from a decline in vitality. The rest of the newborns were confirmed to have nothing special. The KCDC will also conduct blood culture tests on them in case of emergencies. The ministry said it is currently investigating all possibilities of infection or other accidents and will work with related agencies, including the National Institute of Scientific Investigation, to determine the exact cause of death in the future. withwit@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Former presidential secretary for civil affairs Woo Byung-woo is in the first summons investigation after being detained at the Central District Public Prosecutors ' Office in Seoul Friday. / News 1 through News 1, the NotaI suit for journalist Oh Dae-il .... Shim Eon-gi (Seoul = News 1), the reporter of the Prosecutors ' Office, and Choi Eun-ji, the former chief of the NIS, spoke to civilians and civil servants yesterday. It is the first time prosecutors have summoned a prosecutor since the court issued an arrest warrant for Woo on July 15.The NIS investigation team of the Seoul Central District Public Prosecutors ' Office summoned former chief of staff Park Chan-ho (former chief of the team Park Chan-ho) to the prosecution yesterday afternoon. Although the prosecutors initially planned to summon him in the morning, they adjusted the time to take into consideration Woo's family reception.When he arrived at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office around 1:49 p.m. that day, he got out of the van in a suit he wore when he was imprisoned. With a rope around his neck, he headed for the investigating room with guards.Judge Kwon Soon-ho, chief of the Seoul Central District Court's warrant division, previously held questioning suspects before arresting them on July 14, prompting prosecutors to investigate the alleged destruction of evidence and a probe into the case.Woo told Choo Myung-ho, former director of the NIS's national security information bureau last year to investigate former special inspectors Lee Seok-soo, who is investigating him, and to appoint former governor of the Culture and Tourism Ministry officials who are about to run in the elections.Last year, Woo told the NIS to identify and report personal vulnerabilities against progressive educators who are critical of the government. The NIS is known to have reported that it hired former teachers from the Korean Teachers and Education Workers ' Union (KTU) as education offices and promoted internal sense of friendliness and friendliness.He is also suspected of ordering the government to identify the current term of criticism groups under the Korean Federation of Science and Technology Associations and to investigate cases of problems and to be briefed on the operation of cultural and artistic support organizations. Meanwhile, Woo said the NIS investigation team has been indicted on charges of abusing its authority in connection with the latest scandal, including illegal inspections and a blacklist under investigation."
"The incubator of four premature babies who died in the intensive care unit of newborns at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital on July 16 was close by. Three were lined up one at the center of the row. Four of the six incubators in the center of the intensive care unit with 22 incubators died of cardiac arrest. Sixteen premature babies were being treated and the 6 incubators were empty. The hospital explained that the four dead were the most serious newborns.Hospital officials enter the neonatal intensive care unit at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital in central Seoul Monday after four premature babies died one after another. After the accident, 12 infants in the intensive care unit were transferred to another hospital or discharged from hospital. The first heart attack occurred at 5:44 p.m. on the incubator yohan@donga.com in the second week of age, and when doctors gave Cho 20 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, his heart was broken. An eyestrain (24 days old) in an incubator next to the 7:23 trillion shows "" bradycardia "" symptoms with a sluggish heart. Then around 8 p.m., Cho's heart beat again. Baek (five weeks old) showed symptoms of bradycardia at 9 p.m. and Chung (9 days old) at 9:08 p.m. Soon after, all four were buried. The four men died in succession from 9:32 p.m. to 10:53 p.m. in just 1:21 p.m. There were three doctors and five nurses in the intensive care unit.According to Seoul Yangcheon-gu Police Station and the bereaved family, all four of the dead showed symptoms such as swelling of the abdomen and difficulty breathing. Four of the children were killed and suffered the same symptoms at the same time, the hospital said. It is disappointing to see such a thing as an abrupt progression of psychology. The cause of death is still unknown, he said. Newborn parents who rushed to the ICU after receiving a call from the hospital mourned and screamed, "" I'll send you to another hospital, "" and "" a mass infection. "" One of the victims ' families reported the mass deaths to police around 11:07 p.m.The family members of the hospital have complained of problems in responding to the problem. When I told The Dong-A Ilbo in an interview that my daughter was full of gas on the day of her death, I "" I don't have to worry about anything. "" Parents of newborns at intensive care unit said their hospital was usually poorly maintained. "" I didn't see a lot of nurses wearing sanitary gloves and put their hands on the shelves, "" said Jung (36), who was diagnosed with necrosis and moved to another hospital after death. Another infant's guardian Nam (38) said, The Mokdong Hospital allows phones to be brought to the front of an intensive care unit incubator, allowing students to take photographs of their children while on the move. ○ Hospital director Jeong Hye-won apologizes for the deaths of four premature infants of an intensive care unit at the main conference room of Ewha Womans University Hospital in Seoul on July 17, lowering his head's standing position to wait for two new babies. Two of the most recent accidents were the transfer of newborn babies to other hospitals. Only 10 out of the 12 babies who died out of 16 in intensive care units were taken to or discharged from nearby hospitals immediately after their accidents. Two non-active and infant patients who were being treated at the request of a social welfare organization were put on standby for more than 16 hours in a closed ICU. Because of the absence of guardians, it took time to decide which hospitals to move to. The hospital did not send one to Seoul Medical Center until 4:00 p.m., the day after the accident, and sent the other to hospital after the adoption. Health authorities plan to determine the possibility of infection, failure of equipment such as life support devices for incubator, and negligence of medical staff in the intensive care unit. Newbies transferred to other hospitals will also be quarantined and examined. Na Seong-woong, chief of emergency services at the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said, When hygiene and medical technology were poor, enterococcus bacteria killed children at once. We will compare and analyze similar cases in the past.Lee Jee-hun, reporter of the Seoul News Agency easyhoon@donga.com and Kim Yoon-jong, official Facebook for The Dong-A Ilbo, alone / Donga Ilbo, and the total collection of hot economic issues and financial insurance policies are (clicked!) ¹. The hidden insurance benefit integrated inquiry system, ' Find My Insurance ', opens. Any insured person can check whether or not they have hidden insurance money in the system and claim it from the insurance company.The Financial Services Commission announced on July 18 that it would seek out the hidden insurance money from the consumer-led financial reform. According to the Financial Services Commission, the amount of hidden insurance as of the end of October this year is 4.4 trillion won (9 million cases). It is estimated to be worth 5 trillion won in interim insurance, 1.3 trillion won in matured insurance, and one trillion won in dormant insurance that has expired and expired when the cause of payment has not been met.I will check the hidden insurance premium at '(cont.insure.or.kr) which opens at 2:00 p.m. on that day. Currently, not only dormant insurance premiums that life and property insurance association inquires, but also intermediate and matured insurance premiums are available at once. Until the commencement of the pension, the pension fund, which is paid when the insured is alive, was also placed in the hidden insurance system. Check all life and property insurance contracts I have subscribed to, and the hidden premiums on each contract. If the beneficiary requests a financial transaction inquiry service, the beneficiary can also check the beneficiary's insurance contract and premium.My insurance coverage website is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. If checked after a simple self-certification, the insurance premium and the interest amount will be included in the amount at the end of the month. Actual receipts you will be billed and received may vary depending on whether you have lent the insurance contract, the tax, the time of inquiry and the date of interest payment.Interest rates on hidden premiums are provided as specified by insurance policy labels, depending on when the contract is concluded, when it is due, and when the policy expires, the commission said. There is no interest on dormant insurance funds that have expired, and the maturity insurance policies provide interest for the past three years. Interest rates vary depending on when the contract is concluded. After you check the hidden insurance, you should carefully assess the interest rates and receipts before you decide whether to look for them right away or later, the Financial Services Commission said.② If the hidden insurance amount is checked and claimed to an insurance company, the insurance company must return it within three working days from the claim date with minimal confirmation. As the obligation of payment is established, we will make sure that the payment is not delayed, although at the beginning of the market, claims are high and can be delayed somewhat, Sohn Joo-hyung, an insurance manager, explained. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is set to improve the insurance coverage system next year. It will standardize different claim procedures by insurance company and link insurance claims to my insurance coverage system. In addition, the financial authorities, the Ministry of Public Administration and Security and the insurance association held a "" hidden insurance payment campaign "" together to notify the public through mail, bank materials, insurance agents, and architects."
"Experts suspect that two people with "" excess potassium "" in various analyses on the cause of death are infected with a heart attack. Four newborns were under intensive care here on July 16. The cause of death of the four newborns who died one after another at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital on July 16 is unclear. Health authorities are conducting epidemiological surveys and the medical community is divided. There are voices questioning the infection, the necrosis of the newborn, and the error in prescribing medicine, but one can not rule out the possibility that other causes of the disease were found. The clear fact is that there is no precedent for such accidents. We don`t have heard of the deaths of four infants simultaneously, said Oh Soo-young, honorary president of the Korea Academy of Newborn Children. All of the babies who died this time were premature babies (premature babies) who were less than 37 weeks pregnant. Ahn, the first baby to die, was born in 34 weeks and Kim, the second baby to die, was 25 weeks. The two people who later died were 31 weeks. According to the National Statistical Office, premature babies accounted for 7.2 percent (29,939 babies) of the total number of babies born last year. Premature babies are more susceptible to diseases than normal newborns. The shorter the time she stays in her mother's womb and the lighter the weight she weighs, the more so. Four premature babies at Ewha's Mok-dong Hospital were treated in an incubator for newborns. We found the most important patient area, Cho Soo-jin, head of a critical care unit at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital, said in a briefing. Common illnesses in premature babies include infantile respiratory distress syndrome, bronchioplasia, neonatal infection, blood poisoning, premature retinopathy, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Infections in the hospital usually develop slowly but can also develop rapidly. In particular, the possibility of infection increases when people use airway intubation, antibiotics, or stay in the hospital for a long time. Among the newborns, one of the shortest inpatients was on July 9, and the rest were on July 24, 5, 5, and 6 weeks. Evidence has been issued pointing to poor infection control of medical teams. One family member told JTBC, After changing the diapers (medical team), I dumped them on the ground and picked them up with my hand. I put the pasturelle right into the baby's mouth. The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention is examining babies for bacteria by collecting specimens from diapers, linens, and other forms of food. Necrosterosis, or an inflammatory condition in the small intestine, large intestine, and appendix, may be the cause of death. Two of the four babies who died were confirmed to have necrotic enteritis, the KCDC said. The disease occurs in 1 to 5 percent of premature babies. The disease is not an infectious disease and is not passed on to the next person. This disease makes the stomach swollen and indigestion. Some patients even develop cyanosis, in which their body temperature decreases and limbs turn dark blue. One in five people will die. As premature babies with less than 32 weeks of age tend to have less developed organs and much less immune systems, there is an increased risk of complications or death, said Professor A of the Department of Child Studies at a university hospital. In particular, they are more vulnerable to necrotic enteritis. Recently, there have been a series of accidents at Mok-dong Hospital in Ewha Womans University. Last July, two infants were infected with latent tuberculosis by a nurse in an intensive care unit who was infected with tuberculosis, a three-course court infection. Back in September, bugs were also found in sap that was shot by a 5-month-old baby. Health authorities have put a greater weight on the possibility of infection since the 12 premature babies in the intensive care unit have no abnormal symptoms. The possibility of drug administration errors can not be ruled out. If you have potassium dimensionality, the level of potassium in your blood increases suddenly, your heart will be paralyzed, said Professor B of Children's Hospital at the university. We need to inject potassium into its proper capacity and concentration, but it is possible that the units were falsely mixed. In 2010, Jeong Jong-hyeon (then 9 years old), who was being treated for leukemia at Kyungpook National University Hospital, died due to a drug called Vincristin. Some say that it is difficult to determine the cause. Professor B of Children's Hospital at the University Hospital said, "" It is not medically possible for children to die suddenly. "" "" I don't know when the medical team visited Ewha Womans University to check whether it was a minor danger signal.

"MBC President Choi Seung-ho (photo = Lee Han-hyung), who was inaugurated on July 8, was "" Reflective "" with reports and a program. Choi Seung-ho, who was dismissed from the MBC headquarters (MBC headquarters) on July 170 when the Korean Media Workers Union staged a strike on November 8, entered MBC as the new president, not as a capitor. One day ago, MBC's major shareholder and a management supervision organization, the Broadcasting Culture Promotion Association (visiting staff), appointed him as its president with unanimous consent (five attended and five votes cast).Choi, the star producer of the drama, was a leading figure in the drama when he was the subject of the movie, "" The Embryo of the Myth, "" and was distinguished in social accusations such as "" The Prosecutor and Sponsor's Secret of the Four Rivers. "" The following year, he moved to the Korea Research and Journalism Center in 2013 to produce and process the film and made his film debut as a film director through the films ' Confession ' and ' accomplice '. When he became president, the "" stiffness "" of the final interview was the most important factor for being a former producer of jobs, reactions were mixed. If the fishermen's main opposition Democratic Party and the ruling Democratic Party had hoped to "" emerge as a popular broadcaster, "" the Freedom Party immediately denounced MBC as being a full-fledged No-Young broadcaster. He immediately restored workers and carried out personnel and organisational reform without regard to some negative reactions, such as "" pro-union tendency "" or "" No Young Broadcasting. "" MBC members also prepared a "" reflection "" program in the first week of his term, which they had been preparing since the end of the strike. CBS Nocut turned ' One Week on MBC ' after Choi Seung-ho took office.◇ First step in office and immediate return to work, ’’ the last 11 days saw the release of six employed workers (from left : Jung Young-ha, Choi Seung-ho, Lee Yong-ma, Kang Ji-woong, Park Seong-ho, and Park Seong-ho return). What reporter Lee Yong-ma is saying (photo = Kim Soo-jung), policy briefing session, and a final interview, when all three candidates pledged to return to work, it is the first time they will be able to resume their jobs. ' On July 8, the first day of work, Choi and Kim Yeon-kook, head of MBC's headquarters, announced a joint declaration of his return to work immediately.As the first step to end the nine-year-long dominance of broadcasting and restore viewers ` trust in the viewers, all of the union members agreed to return to an agreement immediately after they were illegally fired during the fair broadcasting strike.There was also an event called ' Welcome, isn't it the first time you have been reinstated? ' The six producers, producer of the drama, journalist Park Seong-je, journalist Park Sung-ho, director of the music Jung Young-ha and CEO Choi Seung-ho attended the office after five years of celebration and encouragement from their members. Lee Yong-ma, who is currently unable to come to work due to the fight for cancer, and four others, excluding the head of the presidential staff Choi, were appointed to the post from the first meeting. Kang Ji-woong served as the head of Sisa Culture and Information Division 1, Park Seong-je, the head of the reporting center, and Jung Young-ha, the director of the policy planning bureau. Park Seong-ho, who became a news anchor, is scheduled to host MBC news desk starting July 26.◇ From the left of the massive personnel management line more than 130 people, Vice President Byun Chang-lib, Planning and Coordination Agency Director Cho Hyeong-il, Chief of Press Director Jeong Hyeong-il, Chief Executive Director Koo Ja-jung and Director of Radio Director Kim Jong-kyung, Director of Digital Service Director Park Seong-ran, Ahn Jang-seok, and Director of KBS Prabon. We considered the urgency of the normalization of news, he said, explaining why he is making contact with news agencies, which have been criticized as the most flawed reporting agency for nine years. Reporters at non-production departments took up key posts as a disadvantage for their personnel decisions. Han Jeong-woo, a reporter at the Incheon District Public Prosecutors ` Office, became the head of the news bureau and Doin-tae, a former director of the Unified Broadcasting Institute, was the deputy director of the bureau. Park Joon-woo, a member of the new business development center, and Lee Seong-joo, a former head of MBC headquarters, were appointed as political and economic managers, respectively.At the same time, key reporters lost their jobs, including Oh Jeong-hwan, the head of the press bureau, Deputy Director General Moon Ho-cheol, Deputy Director General Cho Moon-gi, and Chief Information Officer Huh Tae-ho. The news bureau was completely reorganized as it was formerly the headquarters of the former president.Immun-level personnel appointments were also promoted. The 1984 staff member Byun Chang-lib, the highest bidder, was named vice president and former MBC director Cho Neung-hee, who staged a single-disciplined strike when Ahn Kwang-han was president, was appointed as head of the planning and planning and organization. Jeong Hyung-il, a reporter who was in charge of the rink management at the new business development center, and Chung Hyung-il and Lee Keun-haeng, producer of the Guro New Media Format Development Center, respectively, became news and culture chiefs. Ahn Hye-ran, who was suspended for mocking former chairman Kim Jae-chul for his stories such as the company`s ` interesting radio show with Choe Yang-lak `, was appointed to the radio station.In addition, announcers, producers, and reporters who have been in non-production departments for long periods of time due to their participation in strikes or labor activities will return to work or take jobs at the manufacturing site. On the other hand, Shin Dong-ho, the director of the announcer, lost his job, and Bae Hyun-jin, the anchor and Yang Seung-eun, respectively, dropped out of the "" news desk "" and "" departure! video travel. ""◇ Korea Broadcasting System President Choi, who has been reorganized as part of an organization reorganization plan since July 13 with 101 parts of the Group of 20 headquarters, reported a new restructuring plan in Bang Moo-jin, Gangwon Province on July 11. The main objective of the reform was to change the existing eight headquarters from the 31-country Country 9 Center 105 to the Group of 20 Centre 5, part 101. The ministry disbanded during the time of former President Ahn Gwang-han's resignation is now the current affairs and culture headquarters, and the organization and manufacturing bureau that was formerly at the organization's headquarters has been revived as a news bureau. The radio station was moved up a notch to the radio station, and the drama, entertainment, current culture, and radio headquarters were turned over to the president.The birth of a planning headquarters, which was added to the task of organizing past planning headquarters, is also worth noticing. Unlike KBS and SBS, the union was concerned that it would have "" the strongest power ever "" to organize, allocate, and organize strategies. Choi said the goal of the reorganization was to restore reporting and current events and complete the headquarters system. The four headquarters said they planned to restore the quality of contents of MBC and establish a strong support system, and newly introduced the Digital Business Headquarters to comprehensively manage the new media projects.◇ I will thoroughly reflect on my feelings, ’’ MBC news agency President Choi Seung-ho visited MBC News Agency on December 8, "" PD Diary "" on December 12, and MBC Special, on July 14. MBC president and executives visited MBC's joint memorial service in Ansan, Sewoo Aramath. (Photo = Each Capture of the Broadcasting System) The most noticeable thing was the beginning of the ' Choi Seung-ho system '. The promise of a thorough review of the MBC report, which will remind viewers of the scars left by MBC during its reorganization, was made before MBC's main news channel on its first day of office. Although the news desk is currently closed and moving to a temporary system, changes are also felt in content. One example is the more active coverage of the in-house struggle by other media outlets and the Sewol issue.[KBS's longest strike since the inauguration of its head ...] KBS's protest against the normalization of the strike ... (Dec. 9), and [KBS's decision to resign from corrupt directors … on the fifth day of its term, KBS's strike on Dec. 9 …][Five Years After ...

MBC was criticized for misusing the original structure, calculating insurance premiums, running out of families, and illegally straying Gwanghwamun. MBC's apology, which was made in 1338 days, went out through the main news on July 13.On July 12 and 14, if the MBC Ilbook - the collapse of MBC, the seven-year history of cooperation ' and the MBC Special International-Confession of My Friends - focused on the collapse of MBC.◇ The controversy over the dispatch of a special envoy to the Middle East and the backlash from the major networks such as the planned reorganization of the network have not stirred up a controversy over the disclosure. First of all, [Special Middle East envoy sent to MBC as the first news item on MBC main news] on July 11. Is MB corruption involved?The report has become embroiled in an "" inaccurate report "" by Cheong Wa Dae's active retort.Regarding Chief of Staff Lim Jong-seok's visit to the United Arab Emirates as a special envoy, government officials said, "" It is related to the corruption scandal over the past administration. "" But senior presidential secretary for public communication Yoon Young-chan immediately denied, saying, I regret the unconfirmed bold reports, saying, I ask you to make sure that the verification procedures are properly implemented. According to today's media coverage (Dec. 12), MBC announced that it paid attention to the articles as well as the cross-checking, saying, "" Multiple officials confirmed the contents. "" However, he did not report news or official opinions.Some raised complaints from within, as they pushed for an reorganization of the organization without the need to explain their plans to unions or listen in advance. MBC headquarters said in Novo`s July 15 report, "" If management prepares or announces revisions to company regulations that include reorganization, they must listen formally to opinions of the majority labor union, but they should ignore the regulation 94. "" MBC's headquarters explained that the company had omitted the explanation process of the union on July 11 when it posted the draft for its reorganization in-house and on November 13 when it was finalized after the board's approval."
"Pointing out the fact, he urged public apologies and a promise to prevent a recurrence. Another incident was created by the high interest in MBC, which is speeding up its efforts to rebuild its network after ending its strike on July 72. According to reports that announcer Shin Dong-ho is going to resign, an error was made by misunderstanding a Web user with the same name of ` If you don't pay your respects, you should resign. ` The misleading matrix, which was launched at datkeom and did not even identify its author, spread to sports Seoul, Asian economy, Dailian economy, Maeil Business Day and Korean Economic Television.eyesonyou@cbs.co.kr owner of copyright © cbs No Cut News (www.nocutnews.co.kr) reserved.The [When dispatch … South Korea, Im Jong-seok, "" protest nuclear power plants to implement the "" uae] to uae tarwonjeon.South Korea, can you build and operate nuclear power plants properly "" about the tax system at nuclear power plant project manager when meeting received since I've seen … In the picture hwagintal you tried to cover up nuclear energy policy side effects ...""government from Seoul, saying it is uae"" local personnel meeting sought to introduce private nuclear power plants, chairman of nuclear kaldun mb, Park Geun-hye, the construction and government operations involved all the key … the tax deal.Top aide, Im Jong-seok president recently visited the United Arab Emirates (uae) to Prince Muhammad bin Zayed Al Nahyan is the chief of staff for the soap to commit the nation in a position to be a meeting.Baraka Khalifa Al Mubarak (42) General Manager of the nuclear power plant construction project, kaldun uae Atomic Energy Authority (enec) attended by Chairman of the Board that our columns on December 17 alone.It was confirmed by the pictures obtained.Moon Jae-in baraka nuclear power in the policies the government's tarwonjeon uae with regard to when Lim and diplomatic problems to patch up this 'support troops,' in the name.. photos to support the allegations he visited uae Cheong Wa Dae released pictures of the two leaders shaking hands with Mohammas and did not disclose the names of other UAE officials who had contacted him.Kaldun uae Atomic Energy Authority Chairman of the Board, United Arab Emirates - In the past 10 days (local time) capital (uae) at the president's palace in Abu Dhabi, Im Jong-seok (second from right), Cheong Wa Dae.President's chief Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, General Manager at governance (second from left) uae the Khalifa Al Mubarak and kaldun (red.One nuclear work seeing the chairman of the (enec) board.) uae Kaldun is the head of Korea`s nuclear plant project to build an UAE in 2009.

That is because the Copix, the base rate for mortgage loans, has risen sharply. As the Bank of Korea raised the key interest rate last month for the first time in six years and five months, and the United States raised the key interest rate this month, the rise in mortgage rates is likely to accelerate. Fears are growing among borrowers who borrowed money at floating rates in the ultra-low-price era.Banks are expected to make the most profit from the new profit structure, as commercial banks have reportedly raised their profit targets for their lending products, a key component of the rate, in recent years, ' he said.According to financial institutions, major commercial banks such as KB Kookmin, Shinhan, KEB, Woori and NHCF will raise the mortgage rates on their homes on the market on July 18. Nonghyup Bank will raise its new supply base copy-linked mortgage rate (six-month floating rate) from 2.83 to 4.42 percent on July 15 to 2.98 to 4.57 percent on July 18. In other words, the highest rate of interest is 4.6 percent per year. ▲ Hana 3.370 ~ 4.504 % ▲ 3.26 - 4.46 % ▲ SHINHAN 3.12 - 4.43 % ▲ Woori 3.17 ~ 4.17 % adjusted.The adjustable rate hikes reflect the rise in November Copyx, which was recently announced by the Federation of Korean Banks. Copix, the standard of new supply, rose 0.15 percentage point to 1.77 percent in November, the highest increase in two years and seven months since April 2015.As mortgage rates continue to rise, adjustable rate borrowers are having a problem. As the full rate hike is underway, it is desirable to switch from the floating rate to the flat rate in the long run. However, lenders are still under increasing pressure as the fixed rate is still higher than the floating rate. Rather than rushing to the fixed rate as a result of interest rate hikes, one should carefully check the balance of loans and the maturity, a bank official said.Commercial banks have also overstepped their target profit margins on lending products, including mortgage loans, in recent years. According to figures submitted by the Financial Supervisory Service by the National Assembly Friday, 10 out of 15 banks, including banks in the municipal, provincial and provincial regions, raised their household debt target. Nine credit limit lending target areas increased their profit margins, and 10 mortgage loan target areas increased their profit margins.Hana Bank's target return on household credit loans rose from 1.25 % in December 2013 to 2.25 % in December 2015 and 2.73 % last year. Meanwhile, the additional rate was set at 3.04 percent in September, down from 2.76 percent at the end of 2013. Kookmin Bank also saw its share of growth rise from 0.72 percent to 1.40 percent during the same period.Shinhan Bank raised its target return on mortgage loans to 1.25 percent and 1.27 percent for mortgage loans for repayment from 1.12 percent between 2013 and 2015, respectively, in December last year and September. `` Banks created profit with interest rate margins instead of cutting costs through innovation, '' Rep. Jun said, pointing to the need for appropriate guidance by authorities to get them out of the park-and-potato practice.Best bet is on reporter csunell@seoul.co.kr"
"▽ Unprecedented deaths can not be predicted as such and health center reported after 2 hours of exchange death ... = Kim Min-soo, a reporter at Ewha Womans University Hospital, was also reported to have died in an intensive care unit yesterday. Jeong Hye-won, head of the Mok-dong Hospital of Ewha Womans University, has begun a press briefing but has promised to avoid apologies and recurrences, and avoid answering questions about the cause of the accident. According to the death report released by Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital on July 17, the first cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed for the patient, from 5:44 p.m. to 6:04 p.m. The exchange received secondary cardiopulmonary resuscitation at 8:12 p.m., but she died at 10:10 p.m. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was carried out at 7:23 p.m. to 9:32 p.m. for children in B ; at 9:31 p.m. for children in C ; at 9:31 p.m. and at 9:02 p.m. for children in D. Sadly, all of the children died. Bereaved families are complaining that the hospitals were negligent in their treatment and did not tell their patients the truth. Newborn babies were bloated and showed symptoms of breathing difficulty, and doctors are focusing on the possibility of malpractice. Professor Cho Soo-jin, who is in charge of the intensive care unit for newborns, visited the hospital at 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on the day of the accident, but failed to prevent a death. Patients ' management and response to hospital can not help but raise doubts.Park Dong-ju, a reporter at Ewha Hospital at Ewha Womans University The hospital's report on the accident was also late. The exchange guardian called police at 11:07 a.m. on July 16, about 14 minutes after the multiple deaths, but was reported to the public health center in Yangcheon-gu at least 2 hours later. Doctors who should know the condition of premature babies had a slower response than their relatives. Doctors and nurses, especially those in charge of treatment and emergency measures for premature babies who died, responded in the first round of police polls, I don`t know why they died. "" Of course, the patient's physical condition is best understood by the doctors who work in intensive care units, "" a medical official said. "" No matter how urgent the circumstances are at the time, I did not think they would die one day later. "" Communication with the bereaved is also being debated as a poor part of the death toll at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital. It was confirmed that Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital held a press briefing on July 17 without consulting with the bereaved family at all. Furthermore, the government has yet to provide formal briefings on the bereaved. One of the families who knew the press briefing was going on, hurried to the scene and said, "" I want to ask whether the priority at the hospital is the media or the family member, "" and "" Tell the media. Major employers including Chairman Jeong Hye-won repeatedly apologized, but the anger of the bereaved families did not ease. The bereaved should first give a briefing to their bereaved family members. We just apologize, the hospital said, We will not push the bereaved family out of the priorities later. We sincerely apologize to the bereaved family and the public for the incident, said Kim Han-soo, a hospital spokesman, in a close cooperation with related agencies such as the Health Center and the National Police Agency, to find out the reason of the incident and follow up with their best.

This is when the Chinese military enters deep into North Korea`s territory, forming a line called Nampo-Wonsan, which stretches west of Nampo Mountain to the east, and takes control of all North Korean nuclear facilities in Yongbyon. In a recent report titled "" North Korea Attack, "" senior researcher Bruce Benneland said, "" China actually receives the North Korea region in its entirety, and South Korea and the United States have formed a 250-kilometer border or military line. We understand such a scenario is something the Chinese People's Liberation Army is actually reviewing, said an official at Rand Institute. If Beijing implements the most efficient strategy of North Korea`s control of its nuclear facilities and forming the shortest border between Seoul and Pyongyang, it may form a 200-kilometer border connecting the southern part of Pyeongang-do and the southern part of Hamheung Province. U.S. and Chinese experts say the most likely option is to choose between them.

"▽ We have set up a punishment ... To record the contents of lessons, including the recording of the lessons by students and their parents ... To prepare for a lawsuit, 1, 1, an elementary school lawyer, and 35, a teacher at a elementary school in Seoul, recently installed an application. It is because of a protest he received from his parents a few days ago. The child raised his hand for about 30 seconds. A few days later, I received a phone call from my parents saying, Why did I stop my child? The student explained what he did that day, but the parent said, "" If you were a decent child, you couldn't have yelled so hard. We will file a petition with the education office. We apologize for not wanting to make things worse, Lee said.As more and more parents protest against teachers, more and more teachers are preparing their own measures such as recording. A 59 year old elementary school principal in Seoul said, Even with a justifiable teaching method, more parents are making phone calls to school to replace their phones with more recorded phones three years ago. The number of counseling cases for teachers ' rights violations at the Korean Federation of Teachers ' Association (KFTA) increased to 179 in 2006, 287 in 2011 and 572 in 2016. According to the counseling session filed with the Korean Federation of Teachers ' Associations, many parents blamed teachers for the accidents at school, and demanded that their teachers change their classrooms in a proper way. One parent said she was careless about student safety when her elementary school children fell down during practicing skating alone and broke their ankles, and asked her homeroom teacher for damages two years after the incident. Last July, a parent who came to school believing only her children's words slapped her on the cheek with her head. Health care teachers falsely misconstrued the word "" second urinalyst "" for another student and delivered it to their parents, protesting that they had "" given us the results late. "" According to the Education Ministry, there were about 3,500 counseling sessions for teachers who complained of violation of teachers ` rights and job stress in the first half of this year.In the training for teachers conducted by the education office today, senior teachers advise younger teachers to "" leave a thorough record behind. "" ("") A high school teacher in charge of counseling on teacher violations said, As lawyers tend to get cheaper, more parents insist on taking legal action. One middle school teacher in Seoul, Lee (31), said, Some students even raise their voices by threatening to file a civil complaint with the education office for violating students ` human rights. Kim (31), a teacher at a local elementary school in Gyeonggi-do, wrote in a journal saying, "" If you tell parents they've told you that you've given us a hard time without any reason, we can write down how our children have been doing in school. ""Some teachers even record the basics in school because of parents arguing, "" Why didn't you try to prevent this? "" A 32 year-old elementary school teacher in North Jeolla Province said, "" If you're crossing the road, you shouldn't bring your hand across. "" "" Why shouldn't my children be safe, "" in an education room that my parents can see.As teachers are getting involved in lawsuits, teachers ' insurance policies have been introduced. It provides a guarantee on the costs of litigation or arbitration of teachers in the event of a complaint filed with parents or students. The number of contracts for compensation insurance policies for Chamsam Teachers, which was created by Dongbu Fire, has increased every year to 1411 in 2012, 2379 in 2014 and 4395 in 2016. Last July, the KAA started selling a similar insurance policy, the Teachers & Education Workers ' Law. In the first half of this year, 628 contracts were made.As teachers ' questions about the law increased, the teachers ' union established a system called the "" 1 School 1 Torture Bar. "" Schools were allowed to appoint their own counsel and receive counseling quickly. It is operating in 77 schools this year.

Fortune called it the "" World's Most Expensive House. ""However, the identity of the person who purchased the house in 2015 has been shrouded in mystery. However, the New York Times ' own report on July 17 revealed that the house owner, Mohamed Bin, the 32-year-old Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, was found to be buying the house.The original owner of the house was hidden behind a bogus company listed in France, Luxembourg, according to the newspaper. The bogus company is owned by a Saudi company called Ait Investment Company (EIC), which New York said was administered by the head of the prince's private foundation.The Saudi royal advisers have admitted that the house was eventually the home of Prince Mohammed.The French suburb of Paris, called "" Chateau Louis XIV "" and the CogemadEIC were found to have become the other luxury goods purchase route for Crown Prince Mohamed. He reportedly purchased a 132-meter-long yacht from a Russian tycoon in 2015, which cost him 500 million dollars (approximately 544.3 billion won).Therefore, it is possible that the real estate near Paris, which EIC purchased recently and is currently transforming into a hunting ground, was also involved with Prince Mohamed.Prince Vinsalman is also suspected of being the buyer of the room of Leonardo Davinch, which was sold for a record price of $ 450.3 million (about 492.2 billion won) at an art auction. The winning bid was confirmed to be the prince close to the Prince.NYT points out, "" The irony is that the prince, who declares that in Saudi Arabia, enjoys luxury abroad. ""Saudi has been struggling financially over the past few years due to falling global oil prices, tightening its belts over government spending. The continual buying of luxury goods and the leisurely vacation in southern France could deal a fatal blow to the image of the "" social reformer "" on the part of the prince.Former CIA analyst Bruce Liddell said he wanted to create an image of Mohamed as a different (from other royal) and more reform-driven (as a very successful) ghost, but he was quite successful.The Saudi government and the Crown Prince Mohamed were silent on the request of the newspaper to confirm the news.Set up a news and photo report on PyeongChang 2018.The body of a newborn baby who died of treatment at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital is transferred to the Seoul branch of the National Institute of Scientific Investigation for an autopsy on Monday.

When the family raised suspicions about the necrosis of enteritis, including bacterial infections, medical negligence and malfunctioning medical equipment, the international medical team decided to conduct an interview to listen to the family members ' opinions before performing an autopsy.Meanwhile, Yang responded to the question, "" Is it true that the infant was bloated?

News 1 / News 1 / Sungkwan 1 : The possibility of bacterial infection during the lifetime of a newborn baby ─ The surviving infant is not just investigating all four infants in intensive care. Three of the infants who died from the disease were allegedly infected by bacteria during their lives, and the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Jinbon) began an epidemiological investigation.Jilbon said, "" Three newborns were diagnosed with abnormal symptoms before they died, and infection was detected during a blood culture test.According to the report, the hospital conducted a blood culture test around 3:00 p.m. on July 16 after three newborns were exposed to low oxygen levels before their deaths. The other infant was not tested for blood culture because of no abnormal symptoms.Health authorities have determined that three newborns are likely to have bacteria with gram-negative bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria are bacteria that are red when dyed with special colors. Germs that are dyed purple, not red, are called gram-positive bacteria. Both gram-negative and gram-positive strains have pathogenic bacteria, and the types of gram-negative bacteria include salmonella, diplobacillus, colon, and cholera. Health authorities, however, say they should wait and see what exactly the germs were infected and whether they were directly infected. Gram-negative bacteria have narrowed down the bacteria, but it is necessary to identify the exact fungus group to determine the infection path.As a result, the countermobility team, including the epidemiological investigator, is established to examine and examine the deaths of 16 children in the neonatal intensive care unit, including four infant deaths.It also includes symptom monitoring for 12 newborns who are discharged. Among the 12 newborns, eight were taken to another hospital and four were discharged. According to the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention, one out of eight newborns who were transferred to another hospital due to poor stamina was being watched, and one out of four newborns who were discharged had cold symptoms.We are investigating all possibilities, including infection or other accidents, to date, a ministry official said, in a statement to determine the exact cause of death by cooperating with related agencies, including the National Institute of Scientific Investigation.Dongchoy 89 @."
"One in 10 Business owners of Albartoso Dornbert-Marne lost their last helmet when they were forced to kill their children in South Chungcheong Province on October 17 when they failed to pay their jobs It was a part time job that I started secretly saying that I would go to a foreign country with my friends without opening my hands to my parents during the upcoming winter vacation. In an accident, Hong, who was in a state of mental illness when he was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation, was transferred to the Cheonan trauma center at Dankook University. Hong, who was lying in an intensive care unit, never opened his eyes again and died of brain edema, multiple organ damage, and so on on November 23, a month later. It was discovered that Hong's horseholder failed to abide by the "" guard payment obligation "" set by the rules on industrial safety and health, and violated the working standard law that prohibited teenagers from working nights. "" I don't see a different time, "" Hong, 52, the father who lost his youngest son, said in a phone interview with < The Hankyoreh >. This is all Sewol, even if it's just a small incident. Hong's parents refused to encourage him to go to the nearby hills and bury him in a cemetery close to his family's apartments. About 60 friends of Hong Kong in uniform stayed at Cheonan Cemetery in southeastern Seoul, where the first snow fell on July 25 when Hong Kong's departure was made. It has been 20 days since Hong left, but his parents are overwhelmed with resentment and longing. Hong's father said, I think it is still possible to put the youngest in peace of mind when the children die so badly. Dangerous teenage part-time jobs are not only about Hong. The National Statistical Office's report on 2017 Youth Statistics shows one in 10 middle and high school students experience part-time jobs (11.3 %), but teenage labor is at the bottom. It is hard to find cases where teenagers can treat labor safety as cheap and close. On the contrary, there is no systematic response to prevent this situation and protect teenage labor. Amid the abandoned danger, winter vacations are always coming around when teenagers who have finished the College Scholastic Ability Test seek part-time jobs. ■ Among friends who had worked with the nominal Hong on the protection of teenage labor, the company was famous for being "" a place to work without parental permission or license checks. "" When Hong started working at a foot salon, he did not draw up a work contract and was not required to obtain a written consent of his parents, who were required to hire children under the age of 18. All are violations of the Labor Standards Act. If we had told Hong that we would deliver a motorcycle during the cold winter, we would not have written a written consent, said Hong, the owner of the bike, taking away the opportunity to save the youngest. The claims of labor laws on the part of working children are full of pretense. The representative is the minimum wage law. Lee Ju-hye (17), who lives in the Gwangju Metropolitan City, received 4,000 won per hour by working four hours of weekday evenings at a convenience store for two months starting last August. It is only two-thirds of the lowest wage in 2016. The transfer, who worked 20 days a month, was required to receive 578,800 won until the day off, but only 320,000 won was actually given to him. She said, "" I worked a month on the strength of my employer's promise to increase the hourly wage if I work well, but it was all I was going to spend next month on you. "" "" If I could only spend 200 won on my husband's money, I'd ask him to pay him back. "" "" I thought that's all. "" Miss Lee said, "" I didn't respond to my employer's claims. "" After listening to a lecture on labor rights at the Center for Youth and Labor in Gwangju in November, she was informed of her delayed payment. Labor law education is not enough to protect young people working part-time. According to the Korea Youth Policy Institute's survey of 4,000 middle and high school students conducted by teenagers in Korea in 2014, only 16.5 % (648) of them experienced human rights education. Lack of education leads to poor working conditions. Among teenagers who experienced part-time jobs, 71.7 percent answered that they did not respond after experiencing unfair treatment. "" There are many employers who say that teens do not ' defy the theme of their Alba ' when they report problems with the work environment, and in severe cases, they are forced to fire. ""Labor Law Is Far From Deferring Human Rights : 4,000 Won. ■ For teens outside of school, the reality is even colder than the human rights record. Some vice owners make fake contracts with their teenagers because they are financially challenged and have no one to help them, such as parents or teachers. An orphan living in a temple since he was little, he started a delivery job last August that would make as much money as he could to earn living expenses. When he visited a delivery agency, he had to sign an unreasonable contract from the owner. The contract said, ' Save 10,000 won every day for 40 days and pay when you leave the office without any word, pay 100,000 won per day in damages if you are absent without leave, ' and ' pay 100,000 won per night when you are late. ' This violates the principle of wage payment, which requires that all wages be paid on a set date each month. The contract even stated that if you lost a motorcycle owned by the owner while delivering it, or had an accident, you would have to bear all of the responsibilities. The losses incurred in working for the employer should be the management and supervision of the employer and the scope of the worker's responsibilities, which were passed on to the military. Although he suffered serious injuries in a car accident last October, he had to pay 2.4 million won in repair fees to the owner of his motorcycle, not to mention medical bills. Jeong Song-do, a Labour minister, has signed an unfair contract with the county to shift the blame for the wrongdoings of his work to you. A special supervision on teenage labor was revealed last month to regularly abuse teenage workers at a well-known charcoal grill restaurant in Damyang-gun, South Jeolla Province. The restaurant manager repeatedly treated the teenagers who worked part-time with abusive language, violent language, and gave the meat left by the customers as their side dishes. The revelation came in July when two of the victims tipped off at the Gwangju Labor Human Rights Network. A follow-up survey by the Gwangju Regional Employment and Labor Administration showed that at least 14 working part-time workers were regularly verbally abused and assaulted, and that the late payment amounted to nearly 400,000 won. Statistics show that working children can not get out of the human rights blind spot. According to the Korea Youth Policy Institute's 2014 survey, 31.9 percent of teenagers with part-time jobs were underpaid and underpaid for their unfair handling of their work. Only 25.5 percent of the workers wrote contracts. Another 12.5 percent of the respondents said they had heard harsh language abuse from customers, employers, and their superiors, and another 9.7 percent said they had it. Article 32 Clause 5 of the constitution states that "" working in the minor is subject to "" special protection. "" However, the institutional mechanisms to protect teenage labor are insufficient or not working properly. The biggest problem is that neither education authorities nor labor authorities have a designated management office to look at the rights or problems of juveniles. While authorities are at a loss, teens can only respond to the unfair working conditions or stay away from work without being able to find anything to do. Labor Minister Lee Yeon-ju said, We should increase the number of labor inspectors significantly so that we can proctor violators instead of punishing them afterwards. We need to improve the overall response system, including appointing inspectors who are responsible for the vulnerable, such as teenagers.

"The most likely cause of death was "" Four people who died in a large group of newborns at Daemokdong Hospital. "" It is unlikely that four people were killed accidentally overlapped in the nursery of newborns from a university hospital. After the Dong-A Ilbo's team consulted eight pediatric department professors at other university hospitals and infectious and gynecology professors, four of them estimated that the contaminated medicine was highly likely to cause an inflammation. In particular, it is more reasonable to say that viruses or germs were infected by skin contact or air inhalation rather than directly penetrating the blood with an intravenous injection. That is because many infants who showed no particular symptoms died simultaneously. Two newborns infected with the astrovirus and rotavirus were killed in 2001 at a postpartum care center in Goyang, Gyeonggi Province, but it was estimated that they were infected not with blood but with food.The KCDC and Seoul Yangcheon-gu Community Center collected injection and sap for fear of viruses and germs causing blood poisoning. If the antibiotics resistant acinetobacter and pseudomonas aeruginosa are infected, they can cause inflammation in the entire body and lead to septicaemia, which affects the functions of organs. Adults may experience symptoms such as shortness of breath or falling blood pressure, but infants who die during the same period were not exposed to having an infant during their mothers ' stomach (such as premature birth period of 37 weeks). A low level of infection can cause an acute reaction because less than one tenth of adults live in the body of a premature baby, said Professor of infectious medicine at Kachundae Hospital. Some newborns were exposed to such symptoms as swelling nine hours before death, and others said, "" There is a suspicion of necrosis caused by bowel cell death and inflammation. "" If it happened as a group, I suspect it was not due to my immature intestines but from catching viruses or germs, said Park Kook-in, a neonate at Yonsei University Hospital. Three out of eight experts stressed the possibility of temporary life support problems, including oxygen supply. Considering that the heart function has dropped one after another, it is possible that the oxygen supply may have been temporarily suspended, said Goh Hong, professor of the pediatric digestive department at Yonsei University. The Seoul Health and Environment Research Institute is expected to analyze specimens collected at the sites and reveal whether or not viruses were detected on July 18.Cho Geon-hee becom@donga.com & Kim Dan-bi : Dong-Dongbo DongleDongsam Facebook, Official Facebook (Dongsan-Dongsam) ; Hot economic issues and Retech method collection (Click!) ; "" Dongah Daily 150, U.S. Space Station, illegally reissured and printed.Hubble's development plan originally cost $ 300 million (approximately 327 billion won), and the James Webb Space Telescope is expected to pay high costs for its mission.But why is it that they are using space telescopes at such a high cost to launch into space with rockets instead of the ground? A video clip that solves the questions will draw attention.According to a video clip released by the Japanese IT media Gigajin Minet Fijix YouTube, the stars on their lenses are blurred when we try to see the stars with astronomical telescopes on the ground. The biggest reason for the blurred vision is the air, the atmosphere.(Image = Minet Fijix, a video capturing channel on YouTube.) When we try to observe the universe from the ground, clouds, smoke, and fog in the atmosphere blocks out the light. Although the sky is clear and clear, the air itself almost blocks the wavelength of light, so the observations we make from the ground are the visible light (visible light), some of the infrared, and the electromagnetic waves.Also, during the day, air molecules in the atmosphere reflect visible light and remove the light from the stars. Even at night, moonlight and manmade light reflects off the air molecules, darkening distant stars, very dark stars and galaxies. In addition, the atmosphere itself disturbs the stellar observation like a mosaic. The air also always travels with the influence of air and heat to bend the light from the stars.That is, when the sun is up, the sun and clouds, and moonlight and artificial light at night make barrier to the telescope on the ground. They build telescopes in the atmosphere of outer space.Another reason to have astronomical telescopes in space is that they can be observed around the clock. Also keep your distance from the earth so you can avoid the effects of infrared radiation that the earth releases by heat, and keep the body temperature of the telescope low.This would increase the accuracy of the observation using infrared light. The James Webb Space Telescope will be installed about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth.There are also many problems because space telescopes are installed in space. Must be smaller than rocket size, and operating cost is also high. It is estimated that the James Webb Space Telescope (Web-spaced Telescope) will cost 8.83 billion dollars (approximately 9.04 trillion won) in operating costs, including a data center, over the next 10 years.It must be loaded on rockets, so it is expensive to transport personnel for maintenance. The space shuttle has been used to repair and renovate the Hubble Space Telescope at a cost that has become an agenda item for U.S. Congress.However, when you put astronomical telescopes in space, you can clearly observe many of the lights from great galaxies and stars. In particular, the telescope installed on the ground can help you observe even the most invisible light.Please subscribe to Jidinet Korea via Naver channel (paikshow@zdnet.co.kr) First, when it is cold, many Korean people go to Boracay, Philippines.

According to the National Health Insurance Corporation on July 18, the amount and number of cases of compensation for late payment insurance premiums this year is the largest ever, at 188.18 billion won, and 361,738 cases. The amount and number of deficits disposal claims rose to 59.75 billion won in 2012 (40,807 cases), 53.399 billion won (43.9 million cases) in 2013 (43,935 cases), and 65.558 billion won (29.9 million won) in 2014. From 2012, the amount of disposition of losses in 2017 increased 3.1 times over the past five years. The number of cases has increased 8.8 times. Looking into the actual status of the actual reasons for the disposition of deficits in 2017, the total amount of bankruptcies of businesses was highest at 129.2 billion won (16,865 cases). The Health Insurance Corporation is concerned that if the economic situation does not improve due to the fact that many businesses have closed down due to the sluggish economy, the insurance premium will go up further due to bankruptcy. Following, basic living expenses such as medical benefits : 38.55 billion won (338.4 cases), death toll : 1.23 billion won (1,173.1 cases), special disability levels 1.17 billion won (1,173.3 cases), and missing persons (2.3 cases) In particular, the number of cases of disposition of deficits in delinquency insurance premiums for minors has increased sharply this year, although the amount was small. It is so high that it accounted for 79.5 % of the total disposition of losses in 2017.The Health Ministry and the Health and Welfare authorities, which have received nearly 200 billion won in late payment for insurance premiums, have died since 2016 and are exempt from paying much of the insurance premiums for minors who can not afford to pay the premiums. The Health Insurance Corporation expanded its system to provide a mandatory exemption of local subscribers ` health insurance premiums for minors from January 2016, so that minors without parents should not have to pay their own health insurance when they have no assets. In addition, starting April this year, 100,000 to 210,000 parents who were obligated to pay their own health insurance without their parents ' paying their own health insurance will be able to pay the bills that were passed on to them in arrears. They have so far been forced to avoid paying insurance bills or receiving disadvantages in society since their parents ' overdue health insurance costs were either killed or disconnected from their jobs. Prior to 2016, the number of overdue construction insurance premium cases for minors increased only to 144 million in 2014 (110 cases), and to 290 million in 2015 (117 cases). If the National Health Insurance Corporation determines that the insurance premium can not be paid due to the death, missing persons, overseas migration, bankruptcy, and difficulty despite the pressure and seizure, it maintains a policy to avoid personnel and waste budget. Article 72 of the National Health Insurance Act and Article 44 of its Enforcement Decree allow people to dispose of losses when they are deemed unlikely to be collected when the statute of limitations on such rights is completed. shg@yna.co.kr ▶ Report and inquiry (Click!) ② Click! p. ©ay News 1, China Air Force Accountant Identification Zone (Legal and Rational Training)According to advanced big East China, a spokesman for the 18th Air Force (申進科) said Air Force official Weibo, China (華東) local parent China Air Force 18th at the airport bombers, fighter jets and spy plane, and so on.Tsushima Strait are several fighter jets through training in international airspace, the Sea of Japan through an ocean practice, check the ability, said.It is a routine training based on China`s Air Force annual training plans, said Sun, It conforms to relevant international laws and practices, and is not aimed at any specific country or region.All countries have the freedom to navigate and fly in the region under the United Nations ` law pledge `, stressed that the training is lawful and reasonable in China's air force.

Furthermore, it is unusual for the snow to fall once every two to three days, including the heavy snow on July 18.According to the Korea Meteorological Administration on December 18, the average temperature has been below 3 to 5 degrees Celsius since December, compared to the past 30 years. Although the morning temperature in Seoul was - 5.9 degrees Celsius since the previous day (- 11 degrees Celsius), the temperature is still lower than the December average - 3.6 degrees Celsius during the past three decades. A cold snap is expected again this evening. Usually, the cold goes down after snow, and the temperature drops significantly. The lowest temperature is expected to be - 12-3 degrees Celsius on the morning of the 19th and - 4-6 degrees Celsius during the day. The following day, the morning minimum temperature will be - 15 to - 1 degrees Celsius, making the whole nation one of the lowest.The temperature is similar to or slightly lower than normal for the day, but the snow is stopped and a cold snap begins again in the evening, said a KMA official. ◇ Low temperature compared to common year = Negative Arctic shaking is most responsible for the lower temperature than normal due to global warming and negative Arctic vibrations. Arctic vibrations are the repetition of the dynamics of strong swirls (Arctic vortex) around the North Pole in cycles of several days to decades.When the vortex is loose and goes south, temperatures in the mid-latitude region fall below an average year, and when the vortex contracts, a ‘ positive arctic ’ phenomenon cools. Negative Arctic vibrations in which cold Arctic air has recently been able to move downward to the mid - latitudes have been steadily appearing since the middle of last month. Another reason is that the upper high pressure created by global warming near the Ural-carah sea has slowed down, causing the upper cold air to enter the region. Taken together, the cold spell combined with the Arctic quake caused by shaking and global warming has concentrated the Arctic's cold air mass on the Korean Peninsula, leaving Korea with a much cooler climate than the major, commonsensical northern European countries. For example, the lowest temperature in Seoul, which stands at 37 degrees Celsius on July 19, is expected to be - 11 degrees Celsius while Moscow, located at 55 degrees north.◇ Eye protection ceremony for two to three days = Heavy snow fall on the central part of the nation such as Seoul is considered an unexpected phenomenon. The day before yesterday, the Korea Meteorological Administration predicted that Seoul and western Gyeonggi Province would have one to five centimeters of weather, and eastern Gyeonggi Province two to seven centimeters. However, the Korea Meteorological Administration issued a heavy snow alert Monday morning, adjusting the expected amount of snow to 2-7 cm in Seoul, Gyeonggi Province, and parts of the city and western Seoul. Later in the day, the snow alert was lifted and snow cover was revised again to be 1-5 cm in Seoul, Gyeonggi-do and Gangwon-do. This is because the principles of precipitation development in which snow is formed are unclear. Snow falls mostly due to advanced rainfall clouds, but on this day, uncertainties remain, such as the arrival of relatively warm air from the west wind zone only in the games. Office workers who judged it as snow in general on the previous day's forecast had to suffer from an unexpected snow storm. Moreover, it is very unusual for the snow to be heard once every two to three days in December. In early winter, December, I was afraid that the snow would fall every week to 15 days. We are also seeing unusual weather patterns such as cold snap and frequent snow falling, said an official at the Korea Meteorological Administration.Report to the public!

The bank gave out about 7 billion won, and then deducted from the fees of 292 million won and the rent of 418 million won respectively. As a result, Bae applied the minimum annual rate of 39.7 percent to a maximum annual rate of 342 percent. If the debtor failed to repay the principal and interest halfway, we could only borrow more from existing loans and pay some of the debts with overdue interest, said the special investigation officer, who would have to control the rate with such a quick cut.

We don`t set a set period for the protest, the official said. In a press release distributed to the media, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions announced it would hold a press conference at 11:00 a.m., but was defeated by the Democratic Party when it blocked the meeting. A DP official explained, The news conference is not discussed at all.

"" ironn108@newsis.com> 3 out of 4 people who are frequently seen in hospitals are suspected to have been infected with pneumonia and septic shock, but the same number of deaths is not likely due to the detection of three people who are infected with the disease (Yonhap) The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced yesterday that three of the babies who died on the day of death were confirmed to have contracted bacterial infections. When certain symptoms appeared in the three infants of the death of a hospital, doctors voluntarily tested them by drawing blood. However, the other person was not given blood because of no symptoms that would have been necessary for the examination.Choi Pyeong-cheon, a reporter at the Korea Open News Agency, said, "" I heard that four newborns died one after another in an accident at Ewha Womans University's Mok-dong Hospital on July 18 and that of a newly hatched baby died in an accident. A family member is crying. The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention pc@yna.co.kr predicted that fungus from newborns would be able to identify the bacteria in the first two days, but it stated that the bacteria were ' gram-negative. ' Experts say if the bacteria are gram-negative, it could be fatal to the deaths of infants. Gram-negative bacteria are germs that can cause secondary infections in people with immune deficiency or in newborns, including respiratory system-related pneumonia and urinary tract infections, requiring thorough monitoring and treatment. Salmonella, the bacterium, and mycobacterium are gram-negative bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria are often found in hospitals, which are crowded with patients and visitors. According to a study conducted by Korean researchers in 2012, 84.2 percent (64) of 76 samples had gram-negative bacteria detected in the lobby of six well-known university hospitals in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province. Furthermore, all of the children who died this time were premature babies with little immunity, and given that they were new to birth, such bacterial infections could be sufficient to cause death, experts say.In such cases, one can estimate pneumonia or septic shock as a disease that can cause the infant to die. In reality, there have been several cases in Korea in which newborns in postpartum care centers were threatened with death with pneumonia. A related specialist explained, "" Because of bacterial infections, premature babies ' lungs can explode and die suddenly like pneumothorax. "" In addition, due to the nature of premature babies, it is possible to estimate "" septic shock "" resulting from the infection of certain bacteria or viruses while their immune function is low. However, it is also pointed out that the fact that only three out of four premature babies have died, and four have died in the same time in 81 minutes can not be explained by bacterial infections alone. Professor of pediatric at Seoul National University Hospital Park Joon-dong said, "" In an immune-defensed immature stage of life, any bacterial infection could not seem so fatal to the child. "" However, the final blood culture test was still confirmed. bio@yna.co.kr and China's Defense Ministry spokesman Choi Hyun-soo, who is briefing the latest trend of gathering information (Click!), told the U.S. Defense Ministry of Defense Ministry spokesman Lee Young-jae yesterday that the North's nuclear training center in Yongbyon had no news agency.

Dormitory students can not get into some places from Pyeongchang, so they can not get a photo library. According to the 15-day Kyunghyang Daily, residents at a nearby studio in Gangneung, Gangwon Province, are trying to send out university students and give rooms to tourists. This is a trick to make Pyeongchang's 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics special, taking advantage of its lack of sleep. Damage is rising especially in January and February, when re-signing is concentrated with the new semester ahead. The student council of the University of Gangneung, Gyeonggi Province issued a statement on July 13, saying, "" We can guarantee accommodation to some of the dormitories for the national event, but discuss the harm of common sense to students immediately "" Reports say some of the local studio rental companies were delaying the renewal of contracts with college students originally living to rent rooms to tourists during the Olympics. This is because of the calculation that it would be possible to make a large profit on the rent if rooms were given to tourists during the Olympics. A real estate agency representative near the university explained, It costs more than 1 million won per month to get a nearby studio during the Olympics. Considering that the average rent was between 300,000 and 400,000 won per month, it has more than tripled. The number of damages that the student council of the University of Gangneung, Wonju is known to have recorded in the past two days alone is 10. Some of them even pressed to remove the room even when the contract is open, the media said. Students are suffering from the fact that the new semester is scheduled to be held in January and February. Reinvesting is not legally problematic when studio owners refuse to do so, leaving students unable to do so. Students who planned to stay in their own rooms to attend seasonal semester classes have not found a place to go. The bigger problem is that students are not allowed to enter dormitories, either. The University of Seoul said yesterday that it would rent dormitories to the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee from July 12 to Feb. 26, when the Olympic Games are to be completed. The 2018 Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympics athletes village was built on July 15. Pyeongchang athlete's village and Gangneung athletic village, which were first dug out in July 2015, finished their construction in two years and five months. University officials have put up with the success of the Olympics while announcing that other school facilities outside the dormitory are also open to outside organizations such as the Olympic Committee and the police, to avoid any inconvenience.

"The Joint Chiefs of Staff said yesterday that they saw five Chinese fighter jets enter KADIZ from the southwestern room of Ieodo Island around 10:10 a.m. today, and that our air force was urgently launched. The JCS explained, "" Chinese aircraft flew through the JADIZ (Japanese Air Defense Identification Zone) and finally moved out to China from the West's KADIZ region around 1:47 p.m. "" Chinese military aircraft entered KADIZ reportedly had two H-6 strategic bombers, two J-11 fighter jets and a TU-154 reconnaissance plane. The two fighter jets, which entered the overlapping zones of Korea and China southwest of Ieodo Island, also flew in KADIZ, not the overlapping zones. He then entered JADIZ, flew and then circled back to China via KADIZ. Five Chinese military planes entered KADIZ at nearly the same time, but the first two planes left KADIZ at 11:47 a.m. The bombers and the scouts left KADIZ at 1:21 p.m. (final time, 47:17 p.m.). It took about an hour and a half to enter KADIZ and make a full exit to China. The South Korean military seized five Chinese military aircraft as they approached KADIZ at 10:02 a.m. and scrambled the F-15K and KF-16 fighter jets.The first Korean military aircraft detected unidentified tracks off the southwestern part of Ieodo, China's three military aircraft, was confirmed as Chinese hotlines at the Central Air Defense Control Agency (MCRC). Upon receipt of the Chinese military aircraft, the military warned the Chinese government against entering KADIZ via a hotline established between MCRC and the Military and Military and Air Defense Center in past China, China said, adding, "" We will not go in for routine training. "" The official said the precise intention of the Chinese military is being analyzed. China also responded in January when the military sent warning messages via the same hotline when 12 military aircraft invaded KADIZ. Our fighter jets, which were immediately launched from the South, acted as normal tactical measures, including identifying Chinese fighter jets and conducting surveillance flights until they finally left KADIZ, the JCS explained. An air defense identification zone is an area established to identify, track and monitor non-specific aircraft to prevent foreign aircraft from illegally entering the airspace, and is not the same as airspace. Foreign aircraft, both military aircraft and commercial aircraft, must obtain authorization from the concerned military authorities 24 hours in advance to enter the air defense identification zone. Chinese military aircraft also violated KADIZ on January 9 of this year. Twelve Chinese military airplanes, including bombers, flew to KADIZ for four to five hours, and Korean fighter jets were forced to fly. Chinese warplanes reportedly entered KADIZ dozens of times last year. Since the Korean government expanded KADIZ to the south of Ieo Island in December 2013, an area overlapping with the China Air Defense Identification Zone (CADIZ) has been created, raising the possibility of unexpected clashes.

For example, report to the effect is ‘less than the burden in national affairs.’ replies when the investigation is in full swing “I report only to president.” high.Less, presidents will step down after report ‘required inspection order problem in the investigation team’ and ‘necessary maintenance of a public prosecution team probing the case comments’ in the president.In addition to distribute further to specify the ‘chief of staff and senior presidential secretary’ way. The NIS has called in former president Kim Jin-tae to resign before November 2013, saying, Of course, it should close its investigation into the case immediately. The report, titled ` We must control the deviation of the investigating teams `, said, We should convince the new president (Cheong Wa Dae) not to fully utilize the prosecutor`s authority and my own interests before taking office. They are going to the lengths to discredit their teams, talk of a mass resignation, engage in media plays, and seek to step down. The prosecutors continued to appear as the Yoon`s Seok-yeol Kids in the NIS report, suggesting a strategy to disrupt the program through prosecutors ` appointment. On the contrary, they called themselves "" healthy lawyers. "" The NIS then proposed strategic measures by lawmakers to disrupt the special investigation team, suggesting a specific direction for greetings from Yoon Seok-yeol. A demoted official to prosecutor of the investigation team is to take a detour because it would provoke a backlash from the parties and burden public opinion, and to place Park and other figures in the same group in charge of arranging ` taking the lead (good job) ` as a new director in the office. Although it is not a reply case investigation team, it is also suggested that prosecutors who "" follow "" Chae and Yoon should organize naturally according to their "" standards.

Actually, it was only a temple, but it was not known. As prosecutors from the investigation team were called to court to maintain the indictment even after being demoted to the provinces through personnel management, it appears the NIS had kept a close eye on the trends of prosecutors from the investigation team. After the prosecutors were appointed to head to the district, they gathered together at the Seoul Central District Public Prosecutors ` Office every weekend to seek a strategy, receiving their immediate assistance without reflecting on their actions. We also point out that the prosecutors ` office is approving their requests as much as possible for fear of controversies over external pressure, while the team is making all-out efforts to maintain the charges, he said. As an alternative, the prosecution should pay extra attention to keep the non-commanding figures from interfering in investigations, such as Yoon Seok-yeol. Trying to get into politics with Chae Dong-wook as a hero, the damaging NIS seems to have exerted a lot of effort to scratch Chairman Chae Dong-wook at the beginning of its investigation into the comment scandal. The spy agency “less than former president mainly to the public prosecutor's office as Lee pushed the investigation burdens on state management and enhance a sense of incompatibility within the prosecution.” at the time.Report, for direct petition to president, former president less than an unconfirmed open about the Vicious in the week damaged. The NIS has criticized former president Chae as having no debt to the former and present governments and has continuously criticized the pro-popularity measures under the pretext of political independence, said Minister Yoon Seok-yeol in a statement. There are also criticisms that Chae attempts to make a political hero image to enter politics or make major posts when he changes his regime. In particular, the report specifically proposed to Chae that "" a special group of measures should be taken with external forces, "" and made a plea for the actions of prosecutors close to the justice ministry and the outcome of the next major investigation.
