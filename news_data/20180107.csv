Ryu Hyo-jin, a 28, was unable to get over his lethargy after news of his supervisor's sudden resignation recently. External ' family circumstances ' was the reason, but colleagues were quoted as saying, ' I made billions of won from investing in virtual currency. ' Park, who called me on the phone, said, I earned enough money to make money even though I worked for the company all my life. Park said, "" I always wanted to follow the same senior who works with passion, but I couldn't find work because I felt it would be useless to work hard. ""The 20s to 30s are complaining of "" coin depression. "" As the number of young people making large sums of money from virtual currency transactions grows, they feel relatively deprived. It is a side effect and shadow caused by the enthusiasm of the 20s and 30s to the age of virtual currency, accounting for about 60 percent of the country's 2.51 million virtual currency users (as of last month).A decline in morale is a noticeable symptom. A 35-year-old businessman at a large company was disappointed when he heard that his acquaintance recently invested 200 million won in virtual currency and made 1 billion won in three weeks. Ji said, "" Even though I work through weekends and overtime, I don't feel that I have much money left after paying my taxes, but it is useless to hear that I made a lot of money easily around me. "" Kim (30), who has distributed about 50 million won in coins, said, "" Even during working hours, I keep looking at my cell phone every five minutes, and I can't concentrate on my work because I feel more depressed. ""Not everyone laughs, even those who make a profit from virtual money. I think it`s only about 40 million won, said Kim (27), a college student, who has already invested 1.5 million won as a hobby four months ago. I feel like virtual money is heading my life in the wrong direction, but I don`t want to do it, said Kim, who said, "" Virtual money is so obsessed with virtual bills that I failed to pass the final exams late last year.Im Un-taek, a sociology professor at Key-myung University in Seoul, said, "" The notion of not being able to make a big profit with income has become so prevalent, and the expectation of making a fortune at once has become abnormal, "" adding, "" It is a devastating effect on the overall economy.

Called the "" brain "" of the People's Liberation Army, the unified combat command is the supreme command that oversees and commands the military activity of the five light bulbs across China. The basement of Sishan National Park is a limestone Karst Cave more than 1km deep, believed to have a nuclear bunker with the Chinese leadership. The depth of the cave is the same as the world's deepest cave, Krubera Cave, 2.2 kilometers underground. In addition, the cave is covered with thick, hard rock that is 1km thick on the ground or close to the ground, whereas the mouth of Karst Cave, such as Crubera Cave, is close to the ground. This means that it is perfect for nuclear bunkers that need at least 100 meters of rock to withstand a nuclear attack. China Institute of Geologist and Geophysics researcher Qin Dajun said, "" The rock is made of granite, one of the hardest materials on Earth, and the cave is supposed to be the deepest on Earth. "" In addition, the bunker is close to an underground aquifer that can supply more than 1 million people, so there is no problem in the provision of drinking water during the nuclear war. Of course, since underground water can be contaminated with fallout in the event of a nuclear war, sophisticated filters are installed in the bunker to clean it up. China has developed world-class technologies and equipment exactly for this purpose, said Professor Liu Yong of Namhwa University in China, a nuclear scientist. The nuclear bunker, the size of a small town, was built decades ago and has been upgraded recently. China has built several nuclear bunkers throughout the country since the 1950s during the Cold War.

"The minimum hourly wage in 2018 was 7530 won, a 16.4 percent increase from last year's 6470 won. The government is preparing support, expecting the minimum wage increase to lead to greater domestic demand. However, this year's minimum wage increase is so big that it is putting a huge burden on small business owners of convenience stores, restaurants, and small businesses. We cover the economic impact and issues associated with a dramatic minimum wage increase continuously. A, who runs a convenient store in Seongdong-gu, Seoul, recently announced his intention to close the store at the main office. This is because the bottom wage has gone up significantly to 7530 won this year, which has made the bottom dollar less profitable. The 10-pyong store is open 24 hours a day by a couple of 60-somethings and a group of three part-time employees. The total cost of labor that Mr. A paid to three part-time workers last year was about 2.5 million won per month, but it is expected to exceed 3 million won starting this year.Last year, the couple earned 2.5 million to 3 million won per month, excluding labor, rent, and payment from headquarters. Starting this year, the company's support costs for employees have gone from 800,000 won to 600,000 won, up two years after its opening. It is expected that the monthly profit between the two will be only 2 million won this year. Although the couple has been working more than 10 hours a day and reducing their labor costs, their physical strength and earnings have reached a limit, A said, rather than trying to leave the convenient store because it is more lucrative for them to work.A convenience store in Gangnam, Seoul. / A convenience store owner near Yonhap news agency, also recently gave up his contract with another local convenience store near the expiration date. B is a multI-point gun operator who runs two convenience stores. Although he has been taking turns going to the two stores, he decided to concentrate on one store to maximize his labor costs starting this year. If we hire people to work 24 hours a day, we are going to manage one of the stores because it is not profitable, B said.The speed of exit from the convenient store decreased … After closing on the basis of the minimum wage, a steep minimum wage increase of 16.4 % this year, a storm is hitting the convenience store industry. Some shop owners are giving up shop operations, and multiple shop owners are responding to the cold snap in the wage market by reducing the number of stores they sell.According to the convenience store industry on July 7, the number of ' Big 5 ' convenience store stores such as CU, GS25, 7-Eleven, E-Mart 24 and MiniStop, increased by 9085 points at the end of November, 2008. The number of such cases increased from 25,000 at the end of 2013 to 15,000 in four years.But after the announcement of a minimum wage increase, the growth rate in convenience stores has slowed. The number of stores at the nation's five convenience stores rose 2.38 percent to 802 in January last year, but saw a steady decline since then, with 320 convenience stores showing a 0.8 percent rise from the previous month in November.Amid growing calls for saturation at the convenience store due to competition at the store, more and more store owners are closing to pay raises the minimum wage, and this is seen as holding back their businesses. The number of store closures rose to two in the fourth quarter of last year from less than five a month in 2016, said an official at the National convenient store owners ` Council for Family Store owners.As a result of fierce competition at the market, the sales of convenience stores increased, but sales per store fell last year. Sales per store point fell year-on-year from February this year, according to the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy. Sales per store store store store as of November decreased 3.1 % from the same time last year. Employee employment and wage payment are entirely up to the proprietor of a family. If individual convenience stores ` profits fall, the region`s direct impact is small, said an official at a convenience store, saying, The direct impact of the minimum wage hikes is to be carried away by owners of stores.A part-time job is displaying things at a convenience store in Seoul. / Joseon's DB convenience store head office is offering "" a win-win proposal "" such as providing electricity but it is estimated to be inadequate. Currently, the CU and the GS25 have announced a win-win proposal, but the shop owners showed a harsh reaction. Some store owners even declared the plan to nullify the partnership plan, saying, "" The CU, the number one convenience store player, has less than expected. ""Online communities selling convenience stores have seen a noticeable increase in postings since the end of last year. It is because the shop owners who used to operate multI-point stores were selling their stores. Although the multiple store owners are different in their stores, the multiple store owners are around 30 percent, and multiple store owners operate an average of 2.5 stores. "" In the early 2010 when convenience stores were active, we operated 4 to 5 stores as part time jobs and the owners could not afford to take care of them, "" he said. "" Starting this year, the wage rate of retail store operations went up dramatically, "" adding, "" It was hard to keep the wage of the lowest by auto shop. ""Some of the shop owners are raising product prices to preserve labor costs. However, with rival convenience stores scattered around the neighborhood, one can not recklessly raise prices. "" There are three convenience stores within a radius of 50 meters, and if I raise my prices by myself, I would be afraid of losing my regular customers, "" he said.An official at the convenience store industry said, "" The growth methodology of the convenience store industry, which has been expanding its presence since the beginning of the year, will not work even further in the era of minimum wage of 10,000 won.

Parents who put their children before them live by burying their children in their hearts until the day they close their eyes. Bae, who met with his wife at the National Council for National Democratic Families of the Korean National League for Democracy (KBIZ) in Jongno-gu, Seoul, announced on July 6 that the portrait of 105 pro-democracy martyrs was displayed every year. News 1 interviewed Bae with the feature of the 1987 film about martyrs Park Jong-cheol and Lee Han-yeol, who were sacrificed during the democratic movement 30 years ago.

' When she was captured by the National Security Agency in 1987, when she was assassinated by torture, her late wife Park Jong-cheol's death was sparked by water torture. On June 9 of the same year, Lee Han-yeol, who was in a resolve to fight for the concealment of torture murder and abolition of the constitution, was finally killed by tear gas. As a result, the desire for democratization led to the "" June Struggle, "" but the death of his son left a lasting pain in his mother.It was the "" Hanul Life, "" created by the late martyr Jeon-tae-il's mother, who finally accepted Bae, who had lost her son from the brink of death. It became the second home of Bae's family of martyrs who died fighting for democracy, including students and laborers. "" I knew he was exercising. Every time I came down, I smelled tear gas. Her desk was full of socialist books, "" says Bae, "" and she was always anxious about sending her son to college. In this era, plainclothes police were dispatched to universities and tear gas was fired when 10 people gathered to protest."" I always called my son and told him to ' stop in the back and don't stand in front of me when I work out. ' "" She said, "" I called so much, and she thought, ' Don't worry. 'The last memory of the son was of martyr Lee Han-yeol only two days before he was hit by tear gas and collapsed. `` My son came down to Gwangju on June 6 because it was Memorial Day, '' Bae said, concerned, and asked me to ' come home soon when you are finished. Come home with my mom. 'After spending the Memorial Day at home and getting into the car to Seoul the following day, Lee Han-yeol abruptly shut down the car and comforted his mother by saying, I'll be home soon. `` I said that, but it's already been 30 years, '' Bae said. `` To my mother, I was briefly puzzled by the question of how to assess her son who started the democratic movement. '' The sorrow brought by her son's death remained a wound that nothing could heal. But she added, "" I found my son involved in an accident when I was leading the student movement, but I found it hard to say that my son died a coward, "" adding, "" It is not because of all the people who have come with me from democratic scores.

"Ko Jung-hun (alias, lawyer examination), who used to work for a large company at the crossroads, resigned from the company and went on to attend the Seoul High School of Law. Although he became a dream lawyer last year, the job market was literally "" survival jungle "" that encountered outside of school. He was rejected by 14 law firms before he managed to get a grip on his practice in a new law firm.People around me say, How hard it would be to be a lawyer, but some lawyers earn less than two million won a month, Goh said. "" The brothers found it hard to get a job and open doors and skills, "" adding, `` I just gave up my license as a lawyer and started my career again. ''As the number of lawyers increase rapidly with the introduction of the law school system, the difficulty of getting a job grows, unlike the idea that it is hard to say, "" If you graduate from college, you will face fierce competition in the real world. "" Most law school graduates still go to work after becoming lawyers, holding applications from place to place. As more and more lawyers are working for the law firm, so-called gold spoon holders such as their parents and grandparents ' jobs and the family's financial strength, the controversy over the new book system is growing. The analysis of the recruiting results of last year's law firms by Kim In-jang, Pacific Square, Sejong, Yulchon, and Huwoo, which are the top six law firms in Korea, revealed that they hired 112 law firms last year. The number of law school lawyers who have been hired by 75 law firms has increased by half since 2012, but when law school lawyers with large law schools are able to find out more than 1,500 each year, this is a clear indication. In fact, only 5.8 percent of the total number of lawyers who have worked for the 6th law schools is 545, although a total of 9285 law schools have adopted law school graduates. In particular, law-schooled law firms face a greater sense of deprivation by law school lawyers because they do not reduce the number of people who passed the bar examination each year while the number of those who passed the bar examination is decreasing. Last year, 22.22 percent of those who were recently hired by the top six law firms saw their employment soar 13.87 percent from 8.35 percent in 2012. During the same period, the employment rate of the six law firms from the United States increased only slightly from 5.17 percent to 7.00 percent. It is analyzed that the law firms tried to pre-empt the last assailants before the end of their lives. Large law firms say it is difficult to hire law-turned-law lawyers immediately. That is because not many law school graduates have the "" skills to do "" required in the field. One law school lawyer pointed out, It is because students are preoccupied with scores to prepare for tests rather than with expertise and practical ability. A large law firm official said, Especially in the area of law school, people still prefer to go to school because they have to spend a lot of time on their work. Another problem is that there are criticism that it may involve parents ' jobs or the background of a home in hiring large law firms. Even law school students say, Some law schools choose law school lawyers with good standards such as their parents ` jobs to bring cases to justice. One of the reasons why the "" new book system "" has not stopped being debated as being used by law schools as a "" gold spoon "". A large law firm official said, "" The law firms actually had to make a profit, but when hiring talented people, it was not just about their ability to hire talented people but also about their other factors. "" The difficulty of getting a job at law school is not limited to law firms. When law schools were adopted, they were supposed to produce lawyers in public institutions, local governments, businesses, civic groups, and international organizations, but it is not easy for law school lawyers to get jobs in these areas. For example, law school A in Seoul reported only 3.26 percent of those who passed the bar last year found jobs at public institutions and civil groups found only 1.09 percent of those who passed the bar exam. However, the employment rate of companies was slightly higher at 11.96 percent, which is far below the initial expectation. Some say law school students are too much of an eyeful when it comes to the low employment rates of law school graduates at public institutions, but many say the reality is not. For example, lawyer Kim Min-ji (alias : 5th time in Chung-si), who worked for an art foundation since April last year, had to give up his contract to the president's residence and file a petition with the Seoul Regional Court. The company started with a salary of 3 million won, but the complaint was made about the manager and his team members who were certified by the labor union, who were critical of Kim's actions, and refused to renew their contracts. "" It is a long time that lawyers are at a high standard, "" one lawyer said. "" Even when I start working at public institutions, I find lawyers who are not outspoken and who don't, "" and lawyer who says, "" are my own people. ""Lawyers who choose to open as their last resort in the face of job insecurity are also forced into the survival jungle. As the number of lawyers increased, the average number of cases per lawyer was 1.69 cases per month. If you accept one or two cases per month, you can not even afford to rent an office. Indeed, many lawyers feel threatened with survival. The education and legal circles are deeply concerned about this phenomenon. A law professor said, "" Other than a post office, the focus of law schools is on providing quality legal services to the public by providing an unlimited amount of competitive knowledge to administrators, lawyers, taxpayers, and laborers in various fields. "" Another professor said, "" For businesses and public institutions, hiring lawyers is a kind of insurance policy that they should ignore, "" adding, "" Lawyers are actively employed in various fields of society.

"The top solution to our plan to get jobs after graduating from good universities is "" Getting the Wage Differentials in Korea. "" Kim Si-hyeon (34) is nicknamed "" Submarine "" these days. That is why it does not show up well. Coming from a town in the southeast, he was the pride of his family. After graduating from Seoul Central University, he went to graduate school to pursue a master's degree. He was the only master in the family. I went to Canada for language training for a year. After graduating from graduate school, he joined a small and mid-sized company as a full-time worker. Kim, 69, was a trained and well-bred son to his father, who retired due to industrial production. However, now over 30, Kim has quit her job and is preparing for the civil service examination in Noryangjin, Seoul. His friends have settled down in his hometown. Her parents have a small building in their hometown, but Kim only has a 13-square-meter (4-pyong) studio apartment to accommodate herself. It costs 450,000 won per month. `` My father has lived that way as a working class, but I have done nothing since I left graduate school, '' Kim said. `` I don't think I can catch up with my friends who had enough money and studied so hard when I was young. '' The year 2018 is expected to be worth more than $ 30,000 per capita in national income, the standards of developed countries. But more and more people feel that ' our society is not fair ' as time goes by. The results of the 2017 National Recognition Survey at Seoul National University's Graduate School of Public Administration and Research (recognition survey) showed that 74.64 percent of the respondents who answered the question of "" the likelihood of success from an individual effort "" were average. The figure is an increase of 8.96 percent from five years ago. The survey was conducted last year with 6,600 adults nationwide. The results were first revealed through central SUNDAY. The results of the survey showed that 87.42 % (the percentage of respondents who answered ' normal or higher ') answered ' that the government favored the upper class over the respondents themselves '. In other words, even the government thinks it is unfair. The spread of endless controversy over the quality of the deck or gold spoons is interpreted as the reason. Reducing inequality in society is a must solve problem for continued economic growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also recently published a report titled "" High levels of inequality are disadvantageous to long-term economic growth. "" "" As a result of looking into the relationship between the long-term economic growth potential and the levels of inequality in major countries, the possibility of the exchange rate or the rate of inequality among countries is most likely to be kept low, "" said Keum Hyun-seop, a professor at the Graduate School of Public Administration at SNU. Some, though still small, benefit from the increased inequality. This is mainly the case with a stable asset base. Freelance actress Yoon So-jung says he has "" voluntarily given up his full-time job. "" Main source of income is monthly rent from pocket money given by parents and 40-pyong apartments in Banpo-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul. Apartments under his name are mostly rented out to executives at foreign companies in Korea. Yoon earns money by getting work to do on a project when he or she wants to. She is also fluent in English and German because she studied marketing at famous universities abroad and spent her childhood abroad with her father. In the past three years, he has worked for many months, moving from more than five companies to others. `` I know I can live with more benefits than others, '' Yoon said. `` But I don`t think I will change my way for the time being because it does not harm others. '' Of course, Yoon's life is possible thanks to his parents ' generation, not to himself. Even in the recognition survey, respondents cited the inheritance and donation (34.31 percent) as the first cause of inequality in our society. ▶ Government policies (20.52 %) followed by education opportunities (16.72 %). A 46 year-old executive of a conglomerate has pledged not to spend a lot of money on private education for his son. She did not even teach her son to study well like others. She graduated from a prestigious private university and finished her MBA. Kim's son was accepted to a university in the Seoul Metropolitan area in the admission process this year. However, Kim is happy with the results. After all, it`s hard to get a job at a good university, he said. Instead, he asked his son to get as much experience as possible while he was in college. That is why I don't know how the world will change in the future. Kim said, "" Things are not any worse. He has a status in society and can afford to give support to his son in finding what he wants. Professor of sociology at Korea University Lee Myung-jin said, "" As inequality grows, education itself has become a meaningless world. "" He said, "" It is going to be much harder to diagnose inequality in the future than it will be, and it is going to be much harder to do so in the future. "" Is there any way to reduce inequality in our society at the moment? As a result of the recognition survey, respondents pointed out that the combined proportion of inequality mitigation measures (the combined ratio of alternatives in the first and second order) was 45.67 percent (the reduction of companies) and 43.47 percent (the reduction of individuals). In other words, companies with strong influence in the field of employment and investment are urgently needed. Meanwhile, relatively small expectations were found that the inequality could be reduced with the support of the low-income bracket (34.48 percent) and the higher income bracket (31.37 percent). Then, wouldn't the government's redistribution policies be of much help? Professor Gold said, "" Excessive redistribution policies have always been careful as to undermine investment and growth by infringing on the market economy's incentive structures. "" However, the recent problem of inequality has reached an unacceptable level in society. Of course, various devices should be provided to increase the effectiveness of the redistribution policies themselves. Social consensus regarding objective diagnosis of the present situation and policy priorities is also essential. Report on reporter Lee Soe.sookI joongang.co. kr.

Based on the Health Insurance Act (Article 69, Article 71, etc.), the Health Insurance Corporation shall determine the additional income after which additional income is allocated from the lease of buildings, stocks, and deposits, other than the monthly salary. Although some high-income workers complained and even filed for cancellation of the imposition case, the Supreme Court ruled in November 2015. The ministry has revised its plan to lower the burden on the low-income bracket and increase burden on the high-income bracket starting in July, imposing a new standard of assessment on insurance premiums for rich workers based on repair-free incomes. Currently, comprehensive non-salary taxable income must exceed 70 million won per year to impose additional insurance premiums, but reduces the standard rate to levels first (July 2018 to June 2022) by more than 34 million won per year. If this occurs, the number of workers who are subject to additional health insurance will increase to 130,000 in the first and 260,000 in the second stages.Rich (PG) [Production : Tae Ho, Jo Hae-in] Illustration.com for information on reporting and inquiry. 1:1 with reporter.

Sunchonhyang University Gumi Hospital announced that it would recruit two doctors from October to December 2016 and three pediatrician doctors from children and adolescents last November to December. However, it has not applied to a single applicant in two consecutive years. Professors at hospitals contacted doctors in Daegu and other areas to ask for support, but no one answered. The hospital has offered salaries of 15 to 20 million won, millions won more than those of Daegu pediatric doctors. Nevertheless, they do not want to come because of the shortcomings of small cities with lagging educational and cultural backgrounds. Because of this, it is difficult to treat newborns less than three months old. The hospital operated an intensive care unit for newborns with less than 2.5 kg weight or a high-risk infant in an incubator for 37 years and closed in January last year. The secondary medical institution currently has four junior and junior doctors and two physicians. It is half as many as six professors and six majors from four to five years ago. It has been a year since the program to provide out-of-care treatment to newborns on a weekly Wednesday afternoon was discontinued. She is currently seeing a new baby, but she is being sent to Daegu General Hospital if she needs to be hospitalized. As the only care system for newborns in North Gyeongsang Province collapsed, it caused a hole not only in Gumi but also in Kimchun-jung-do, North Gyeongsang Province. Although the treatment system for newborns is one of the solutions to the low birth rate, the situation has become too difficult to equip due to the shortage of babies.Sunchunhyang University Gumi Hospital closed its 37 year infant intensive care unit in January 2017 due to a lack of medical staff. Medical officials explain that doctors in the metropolitan area in their 40s and 50s are reluctant to work in small cities because of the environment of their children's education. We need to hire a pediatrician and we can consider expanding outpatient treatment for newborns and re-operating the intensive care unit, but we don`t have any options at the moment, said Lim Ki-seop, public relations officer at Gumi Hospital. Professor Lee Hee-kyung of the pediatric department said, "" If the treatment system collapses, the residential conditions for young couples in small cities and newborn babies will worsen, and the government will not provide a favorable solution to the low birthrate.

A driver pumps gas at a self-service gas station in Seoul yesterday. Kim Young-woo, a 39-year-old man who runs a meat buffet restaurant in Doksan-dong, Seoul, decreased the number of people serving the buffet dinner from two to one this year. The workers were forced to be taken care of by themselves and their 60-something mother. I used to work at the counter during meals, but I don`t have enough money to cover my mother and I don`t have to spend my entire month working at all. The policies for the weak are most likely to damage the weak.As the minimum wage for this year is increased by 16.4 percent to 7530 per hour, the non-regular employment market, including part-time jobs, is frozen rapidly. A public parking lot in Yongsan-gu, Seoul, has been confirmed to have cut its parking management staff by 10 percent since this month. One parking agent at the compound said, Of course, I don't know if anyone went out, but with nine hours of work a day and a few days of rest, the rest of us were also struggling.A gas station in YeonhuI-dong is also planning to shorten business hours by releasing its formerly late-night albiters from March. The gas station owner said, Although the government is providing job security funds, it does not seem to have much meaning since it is a one-time program.A man who runs a convenience store in Gangseo-gu made a ' rules of conduct for workers ' that were never there before. This manual is written by a student who ordered a product every hour, displayed, and cleaned it. `` I can't let my Arviete pay me a lot more time without doing my work, '' he said.Taxi drivers have also become victims of the minimum wage increase. About 30 union members of a taxi company held a rally in the Deokjeong Station in Yangju, Gyeonggi Province on July 5 to protest the raise of company tuition. They said the company has raised the daily payment by a whopping 82,000 won in collusion with the government-controlled union. In Uijeongbu, last September, 15 taxi drivers raised the tuition by 35,000 won, and in November, taxi drivers in Hwaseong raised the payment by 19,000 won and took off excess drivers by 40 percent.The restaurant franchises have already begun raising prices for the minimum wage hikes. KFC raised prices of its 24 menus, including chicken, burgers, side dishes and drinks by 100-800 won starting on July 29. The average increase rate is 5.9 %. Lotteria also raised prices of hamburgers, desserts and drinks by 100 won last November, and shrimp burgers 200 won. It is known that the Korean franchises and chicken companies such as Nolbu Budae and Seolnongtang will raise the price simultaneously this year.Low-priced coffee and snack shops and fast food restaurants are introducing unmanned systems. Coffee Man, a franchise known as 900 won coffee, has expanded its unmanned payment system, starting at Seoul`s Gangnam station late last year, including the City Hall station, Bangbae Province, Seolleung station and Hongdae district. In front of Ewha Womans University, Gangnam Station and Hakdong Station, an unmanned café with coffee machines was built to let consumers make their own coffee. We have a lot of questions from owners about the introduction of the unmanned payment system since the end of last year when minimum wage increases were announced, said an official at Coffee Franchise headquarters.The snack bar has also begun to introduce kiosks instead of reducing the number of patients who have had to study medicine. The average price of a kiosk for an order is 3 to 7 million won per store. For example, the cost of a Kiosk per person (minimum wage and minimum wage) decreases to 5 million won per year.""

The station last used by astronauts in 2013 stopped functioning in March 2016. China reported the reason to the United Nations in May of the same year. Professor Roger Somberg of the Central Ploridge explained, China may have lost control of its space station due to a lack of fuel. Then in September 2016, China launched its experimental space station Tiangong 2.China's manned spacecraft, the Shengong-2, is docking down on board because of the Earth's gravity. It was at an altitude of 348.3 kilometers in March last year, but it dropped to an altitude of 286.5 kilometers on July 24, after nine months. The best scenario assuming the crash of Tiangong-1 is when the station enters the Earth's atmosphere above the ocean, mostly on fire and very few debris sinks below the ocean floor. Meanwhile, when the Tiangong-1 reenters onto the densely populated area, some large debris falls to the ground and cause damage, it is considered the worst scenario. Space experts say the odds of space station debris falling on Earth and hitting a human are one trillion to one. It is much lower than the 1.4 millionth chance that Americans are struck by lightning. "" It is a small, real danger, but it is not true today, "" said Dr. Jonathan McDarwall of the Harvard - Smithsonian's Center for Astrophysics and Space Control, a Chinese manned spacecraft that controls the Shenzhou 11. If China`s space icon Tiangong`s first fall to Earth, it will blemish China's bold drive to become a aerospace superpower, CNN explained. Cosmonaut Michael Listner, an expert on space law, also diagnosed the crash as `` an opportunity for Western experts to look into bits of Chinese space hardware, which is a danger to China. '' The Tiangong-1 crash rate on the Korean Peninsula is 0.4 percent, according to the Ministry of Science and Technology and Information, and can be predicted by the exact time and location of the crash one to two hours earlier. rice@yna.co.kr"

The accident tanker was with 136,000 tons of condensed milk loaded with Iranian shipping company Bright as it was on its way to Korea from Iran. The tanker had 30 Iranian and two Bangladeshis on board. The 21 crew members aboard the accident freighter were rescued and taken to fishing boats operating nearby. The freighter was on the way to Guangdong, China, carrying 64,000 tons of grain, and all of its crew members are Chinese. After the accident, Chinese authorities considered it to be a very important accident and are currently sending a large number of Coast Guard rescue ships to the scene to search for them.

The discount of 20 percent on September 15 last year, when the discount rate rose to 25 percent, he was unable to change because of his one-year contract. It was because of the penalty. Eventually, he had to give up the extra 3,000 won per month. A is now waiting until the Lunar New Year's Day in February. That is because the remaining contracts are less than six months old and can be transferred to a 25 percent discount without penalty. Mobile phone companies and the Ministry of Science and Technology and Information and Communication say they have reduced the price by 25 percent by nearly four months, but the number of subscribers who receive a 20 percent discount amounts to 13 million, according to the ministry. Discount subscribers totaled 81.8 million as of December 15 last year, of which 25-6 million are discounted, or only 30 percent. Seven out of ten discount customers still only get 20 % off. Most of them are estimated to have failed to make the change to 25 percent because they have many remaining contracts like Mr. A. Due to the complicated procedure, many subscribers are staying at a 20 percent discount. If the new premium is not much larger than usual after the 25 percent discount on pictures of Yonhap news, the percentage of subscribers who are tied to 20 percent discount may have been higher. As high-end phones including the Galaxy Note 8 were launched on September 15, the number of discount subscribers increased rapidly with the release of LG V0, iPhone 8 and iPhone X. More than 90 percent of buyers of these products reportedly chose a 25 percent discount instead of a low-discounted subsidy. Most of the discount subscribers are customers who purchase new handsets to sign up, an industry official said, Not many customers have switched to a 25 percent discount. Some of the existing 20 % discount subscribers are found to keep their existing arrangements as a burden on the re-importing. That is because they need another year or two of contracts to get a 25 percent discount. Customers who face terminal replacement can choose less because they need to return the existing benefits when the contract period is extended to receive a new discount. In the future, the majority of discount subscribers are expected to move to 25 % sequentially. The government expects the number of discount subscribers to grow to 19 million per year. However, considering when the existing contract expires, it is expected that the entire discount rate will not be reduced by 25 percent until 2019. More than half of all new subscribers are already choosing to pay less, an official of the Ministry of Information and Communication said, adding that the effect of the system is quickly settling down. But, Yoon Chul-han, director general of Citizens ` Coalition for Economic Justice, said, 25 percent discount is a structure in which consumers must choose to benefit. The future communication policies, including the Universal Rate System, should go in a direction that gives universal benefits to all Koreans, he stressed. okko@yna.co.kr"

"1987 was a tumultuous year that completely changed the course of modern history. Thirty years later, a movie that reproduces the remaining history is very popular. The movie tells the story of a fatal accident committed by the martyr Park Jong-chul and the democratic uprising in June 1987.In particular, the film focuses on the people who lived in 1987 as well as on the events of 1987, so it is very touching and entertaining for those who did not live during that time. How are they going now?In January 1987, when Chun Doo-hwan was in office, police arrested Park Jong-cheol, a linguistics student at Seoul National University and led him to the loss of an official building in Namyeong-dong, Seoul. Police have tortured Park Jong-cheol to tell the whereabouts of Park Jong-woon, a senior and wanted to be identified as the Park Jong-woon who was wanted in the Seoul National Unification Promotion Board scandal, on January 14, when he was severely tortured to death.Police called Dr. Oh Yeon-sang from the emergency room at the nearby Yongsan Hospital, but Park was already dead when Oh arrived. The police in a hurry asked the Seoul District Prosecutors ' Office for Park Jong-cheol's body makeup, saying they have reached an agreement with their guardian. However, Choi Hwan, a prosecutor at the time, refused and ordered an autopsy.On January 15, one night after Park Jong-cheol's death, the head of the public security department announced an outline of the incident.■ The Park Jong-cheol incident is a complete fabrication. "" The manipulators lied, "" People who move to the truth "" and "" They smashed the desks "" to death, and then covered up their torture. To reveal the truth, the media ignored the news guidelines and started running articles. At that time, the reporter for JoongAng Ilbo, Shin Seong-ho, first reported on the murder of adviser Park Jong-cheol, and Yun Sang-sam, the reporter of The Dong-A Ilbo, persuaded an assistant prosecutor to declare his conscience regarding water torture.Lee Bu-young, a journalist at the time, had secretly written to prison officials about the murder, concealment, and fabrication of torture by Park Jong-cheol, which was passed on to Kim Jong-nam, who was an opposition.Father Kim Seung-hun of the Catholic Priests ' Association for Justice, who received the note, revealed it at a memorial mass on May 18, 1987 during the 7th anniversary of the pro-democracy movement in Gwangju. The revelations further strengthened the democratic movement, and the June 9, 1987 pro-democracy uprising led to the death of martyr Lee Han-yeol, who was shot in the head by a riot policeman while shouting for democracy.■ Those who try to cover up the killing spree in the movies < 1987 > … Park Cheo-won, who was trying to lead the way in a different action film, hit a famous desk with a famous one, saying, "" It's a huge blow. "" He was arrested for ordering the secrecy surrounding the scandal as a real-life figure, but was sentenced by the Supreme Court in 1996 to a suspended sentence of one year and six months. Park Chat-won later did not apologize for the murder of a consultant, and was sentenced to two years in jail in 2000 for supporting the hiding and escaping of "" consultant technician "" Lee Keun-an.Choi Hwan, a lawyer ordered an autopsy on Park Jong-cheol to stop the police from covering up, is also a real man. 6.10 after pro-democracy movement, the Seoul District Public Prosecutor`s Office, Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, both to restrain a former president, too. Choi currently runs his own office. Shin Seong-ho, who first reported on the fatal case of torture by Park Jong-cheol at the time, is currently a professor of journalism at Sungkyunkwan University. Correspondent Yoon Sang-sam won the Korean Press Award for his services and died of cancer during 1999.Park Jong-woon, a senior at the army, joined the GNP in 2000 after serving as a member of the "" Park Jong-chul Memorial Association. "" Park has since run for 16, 17 and 18 National Assembly seats, but lost. Lee Bu-young, who wrote a note in jail to tell the truth about the murder of torture Park Jong-cheol, entered politics by joining the Democratic Party in 1990 and then retired from politics as Uri chairman.Kim Jong-nam, who delivered a note to Father Kim Seung-hoon, is reportedly reviewing the history of the pro-democracy movement after serving as senior secretary for education, culture and society at Cheong Wa Dae. Although the government has repeatedly said it would stabilize the housing market, apartment prices are soaring in the Gangnam area, Seoul, paying keen attention to whether the government's three-stage plan can actually stabilize housing prices.Apartment prices are attached to a property market in Junggye-dong, Nowon-gu, Seoul, on Jan. 4, 2018. The government is set to introduce a new DTI before it begins by the end of this month to block speculative funds flowing into the property market. The new DTI is the annual income distribution of all mortgage principals and interests on all home equity loans, not mortgage loans. The existing DTI is divided into annual incomes by adding the principal of new mortgage loans and other lending interests, including existing mortgage loans. Since the new DTI is the calculation of the principal amount of existing mortgage loans, it is expected to block the speculative funds of multiple households. The Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service are taking the necessary administrative steps aimed at implementing the new DTI at the end of this month.The third measure to stabilize the housing market requires multiple homeowners to revise their property tax [production, Cho Hye-in, and Choi Ja-yoon] starting April, when multiple home owners sell their home in 40 areas around the country. If the new DTI is an indirect regulation blocking funds flowing into the property market, the heavier tax will burden multiple home owners more directly. Currently, a basic tax rate of 6-42 % is applied depending on the transfer gains, but the tax rate will increase to 16-62 % when heavier taxes are imposed. The government earlier issued a warning to speculators, saying, ' If it is not a house until April 2018, sell it or sell it. ' Attention is paid to what effect this first step will have on the heavier tax burden. The third card released by the government is a holding tax aimed at multiple home owners. Although the specific outline has not yet been unveiled, it is expected to increase the tax burden on owners of more than two homes or establish a new standard for owners of three or more homes. Government under president's policy planning committee in the first draft of the property tax reform measures within the first half of operating a special committee as early as fiscal reform plans to. The selection process is almost complete with tax experts, explained a ministry official.Visitors look at a home model in Seoul's Hillstate Classic, Singil-dong, Yeongdeungpo-gu, November 17, 2017. ▽ Combined news item photo = Although the new DTI, the heavier tax, and the revision of holding taxes are virtually announced, some real estate market jitters have not abated. Apartment prices in Gangnam-gu recorded an increase of 0.78 percent (based on the real estate aggregate 114) in the first week of January, fueling the rise in real estate prices in Seoul. In the market, the supply is limited and demand is not falling, and landlords are collecting more of the supply in anticipation of higher housing prices. As the successive implementation of the three-stage plan narrows the regulatory network for multiple home owners and speculative forces, the authorities and participants in the real estate market are expected to engage in a fierce fight. sewonlee@yna.co.kr"

It is the biggest decline since the NSO began compiling related figures in 2000.A decline for the first three years in a row is also likely. December is still remaining, but the decrease in January to November is too great. The index also declined 0.8 %, 1.8 %, in 2016 and 2015. The gross service sector output index rose 2.6 percent from January to November this year, compared with 16 straight years of positive output. The restaurant industry is interpreted as the aftermath of the changes in social structure, including youth unemployment, the increase of single-person households, and the simplification of dining culture.Although food and bar businesses are showing signs of slowing down, businesses are expanding. The number of food and beverage companies rose by 10,6113 (2.8 %) to 671,199 in 2016 from a year earlier. It is higher than the overall business growth rate of 2.81 million 6664 in 2016 and 2.3 % ↑. More than a quarter (24.0 %) of Korean businesses are food and beverage companies.In proportion, the number of workers has continued to grow, but income and working conditions are the worst in the industry. According to the statistics on job administration in 2016, the number of jobs in the accommodation and restaurant industries increased by 24,000 to 1,148,000. However, the average income is 1.87 million won per month, the lowest in the industry. It was less than half of the average amount of 28.1 million won. The average length of service was also 1.3 years, the most unstable in the industry.Prospects for the management environment are also uncertain. Social and cultural changes, such as the increase of one-person households, are expected to continue for the time being. It is also a burden for businesses that the minimum wage (75.30 won) has been raised to an unprecedented 16.4 percent this year. The government has set a goal of raising the minimum wage to 10,000 won in three years.A food and bar businessman is a price-up. Food prices rose 2.4 percent year-on-year last year, exceeding the overall consumer price increase of 1.9 percent. For the fifth year in a row, the price of dining out has exceeded consumer prices. In particular, the number of people eating out by the working class was much higher. Kimbab gained 7.8 percent last year. Soju also rose by 5.2 percent. Galbitang, ramen, jjambbong, and fried rice were also on the top list. However, as prices go up, consumers are likely to fall into a vicious cycle.The government has also recognized the seriousness of the situation and has taken steps to prepare countermeasures. The ' job security fund ' that began early this year is a good example. To reduce the minimum wage burden on self-employed small businesses, monthly wage hikes will be carried out by about 130,000 won per employee. The government has set aside about 3 million people for support and has set aside about 3 trillion won. The government will also announce further measures to reduce the burden on small businesses with the minimum wage increase later this month.Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economic Affairs and Trade Kim Dong-yeon listens to the voices of the scene while visiting a restaurant in Jongno, Seoul yesterday."
"○ National Tax Service (NTS) in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, should pay 7 billion won in taxpayers ' money to raise funds for its scholarship fund, which was planned to form a Daejong Order TF, to claim "" No Bell to be subsidised on New Year's Eve. "" Last year`s earthquake caused 54.6 billion won in Pohang alone, prompting the government to pour 444 billion won in restoration costs, underestimating the excessive spending. Pohang City announced on July 7 that it will organize a large-scale production task force of employees from four different departments of the government, construction, urban regeneration, and international collaboration tours to mark the 70th anniversary of its promotion next year. In addition, they plan to organize a large-scale committee to choose the size, design, and installation site of the Daejong Production Committee with 30 members and experts. The total cost is 3 billion won, including 1.5 billion won to manufacture the bell and 1.5 billion won to produce the bell. The city reviewed the production at Homigot in Nam-gu last year, where the New Year Festival was held, as claims were made that there is no bell to be hatched on New Year's Eve. Pohang City will play the bell which appears on the digital screen at midnight on the last day.However, he pointed out that the construction of the Daejong is unavoidable, as Pohang City Museum of Art was unable to open its doors for nearly two months due to last November's earthquake. The earthquake damaged Pohang, the world`s most populous nation, by 54.18 billion won, and is estimated to have caused more than 444 billion won in restored obesity. Hwang Byung-yeol, former head of the Pohang Residents ' Participation and Budget Committee, said, "" With more than 500 people living in the area, such as the indoor gymnasium in the east of Pohang City, it is more urgent to produce multibillion-dollar apartments. ""Pohang Mayor Lee Kang-duk and other officials of Pohang University of Science and Technology announced the end of the year by hitting a bell rising from a video clip at the Homigot, where the New Year Festival was held on December 31 last year. The origin of the production costs for the large conglomerates offered by Pohang City is also controversial. Pohang City plans to finance the creation of a regional cooperation fund of 3 billion won, which the Daegu Bank, designated as Pohang City Depository, manages for a three-year period of time, of 1.38 trillion won. When the Daegu Bank received the pension three years ago, it donated it to the Pohang City Scholarship Council, where it used the local cooperation fund as a scholarship fund for high school students and university students who had excellent grades. Pohang City Councilman Han said, It is more hard to understand that Pohang City Scholars ` Association is struggling to raise a scholarship fund because of low interest rates and the sluggish economy, and that it should use local cooperation funds to make large donations.In response, Pohang officials said, We are discussing forming an interdepartmental task force to build a large bell, adding, Nothing has been decided yet, including the location of the bell.Pohang City said, "" We will increase the status of the birthplace of the Saemaeul Movement in 2016, "" adding, "" We should pay 350 million won to draw up a national flag with a height of 45 meter and close it by 12 meter and eight meter with taxpayers ' money.

"[Shindonga] From healing to retaking, can you feel the same affection in plants as your family and friends? As the population became emotionally attached to plants growing at home in the era of the single-person households, plants were also labeled as "" companions. "" A companion plant that provides emotional stability and quiet healing with relatively less time than an animal. It is interesting to utilize the plant that I used to grow in my diet in a small way.[Ji Ho-young] : Choi Gyeong-sun (34), who lives in Mangwon-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul, has a large number of tiny potted plants lined up on the veranda. The number increased by the use of two small potted plants I bought accidentally five years ago. Now, he is quite a ` companion plant specialist ` who is rich enough to give plant pots to people he knows. "" As I moved, I began to plant a pot in my car while I was thinking about keeping a puppy. I've had plants before, but they didn't last long. Even though it was not easy to grow the plants, they would easily dry up or decay. So, this time, I decided to raise it properly, and surf the Internet and learn some acquaintances. He would stop by a nearby florist and ask for advice. "" The first plants he got when he moved were available today are Ivy, Channium, and even the first plants he can afford to grow were easy to get to where plants were available. "" The oldest of his veranda plants is the Table Palm. A small tree with only two stems five years ago is now occupying a large area with six to seven large stems.People and plant owners say, "" I'd like to recommend growing plants for the people around me. "" [reporter Ji Ho-young] : "" You often say ' companion plant ' these days. It's a very appropriate expression. For me, it feels like a child. When the leaves are green and green, it makes me feel proud, and when I get tired, it makes me feel uncomfortable. When a plant dies, I feel as if everything is my fault. I feel grateful for watering it once every time I can remember and praising "" You are growing pretty. "" I can't talk, but I'm sure plants know we're not comforting. "" Now, I think the phrase "" pets "" has not been attached to animals in the home for years, and that's why I've been saying pets for years. Choi recommends that friends who are considering adopting pets grow plants instead of animals. "" Especially if you are single people who work, you want to stop adopting pets. Raising pets is much harder than you think, and there are many things to consider. Animals who are confined to their homes all day long are also under stress and loneliness, but they are often made to be mean when they need to travel or leave. We can't rule out the worst that can be inevitably thrown away when things happen that are not accountable. "" Of course, leaving it as a plant or forcing it to go in for the other side of the fence. If you miss the time of water supply, you will dry out beyond repair, and if you spilt water enough, you will not be able to restore the roots. Still, Choi believes that psychological shock and fear that pets receive is a relatively small advantage compared to the deaths of their owners.Come to think of it, growing plants is not something unusual that has suddenly appeared in society. Growing plants or tending an egg on a flower bed has always been easy for any family to see before. What's changed is the public's interest in plant net performance, more than growing plants. That is why modern people's solitude and solitude - which are the only ways to give one's mind to a plant and depend upon it - are symbolic changes. Like the pot that appeared in Leon. < South Korean trend, Choi Min-soo, Korean economy newspaper _ and other advantages include cleaning up the air, creating a pleasant environment, and spending less money on management than pets. According to a recent report by Macromile M-Brain, an online research firm, 58 percent of Koreans currently have plants they grow themselves, and 27 percent do not have experience in the past.

"" Plants are always good friends at home. Some view modern lifestyle as being "" disconnected, "" but friends are the most important things in life. The difference is that, in the past, if you met face-to-face and had a bond, you recently had more cases of online communication and networking. And I think plants have become good friends with people. "" He recently stated, "" As plant interior design, which refers to the plant interior, has become popular, a growing number of people are using plants as a means to retouch plants. "" First of all, he is a living witness of plant preservation since he has operated plant sales and distribution sites for the past 16 years. As he ran an online software company, he got potted plants to change the stark office atmosphere and then went online to work on a business idea. "" We had a lot of problems at the beginning of the project. It's strange to buy plants online, and we haven't developed a suitable packaging method for shipping, and many of them were damaged during deliveries. But these days, packaging systems are well equipped and the awareness between vendors and customers has become more popular. The local flower shop is on the decline, but the online commerce is on the rise. "" Another interesting shift is the variety of what used to be between professional sellers and regular consumers, who are seeing a shift in trade around plant manias. In the beginning, the CEO started his business by saying, "" Most of the plants are easy to grow indoors and have great air purification effects, "" but recently, he said that they are highly effective in retaking the wild, not to mention growing them indoors. "" If you used to think of plants as ornamental, these days more people are thinking of plants as jobs than as hobbies. You start keeping one or two as a hobby, and when you grow in quantity, you think, "" Oh, you can sell it and make a profit. "" It's hard to do in a small space like an apartment, but you don't need a large environment like a plastic house. And like professional farmers, plant re-teaching is not required when grown from beginning to end. Some people grow and sell plants on the rooftop of regular houses, buy small potted plants, and put them back into neat pots. You can make a profit by simply buying and transplanting the plants and plants, respectively. People would rather buy a plant that was planted in pretty potted plants.

Palmer Daddy is the name of a field he personally designed and worked on for nearly 4 years, covering about 6,600 ㎡ of land he inherited from his father. "" I wanted to show that the fields can be pretty, too. And I decided at the time that I would try to get people to pay a visit to this field. "" And he did this with this whole garden square, which was a great show of vegetable garden cultures, in the fall of 2013 at Biennale. No wonder he made such a beautiful field. In our garden, where fresh food grows such as cabbages, radishes, chives, carrots, and leeks, the flowers that insects dislike, Marigold and herbs, were planted together, a garden function of beauty that provided a garden Palmer Daddy is an extension of this idea. Different flowers were designed to produce different seasons, and fruit was harvested. Bamboo and colorful bars are used as supports in his field, and are used as an arch to link the ivy plant. Choi Si-hyung turned to the field because modern people felt like refugees from wrecked ships swept by the enormous wave of industrialization.

"Stand at the head of the ‘ de ’. "" I want to let modern people find the lost rhythm of life through plants and fields, "" he said. [Ji Ho-young] : "" I think the fast-paced culture of our society has exhausted me. Korea is fast. Architecture is no exception. I wanted to leave the industry because I was tired of my work, but I couldn't wait to find Superman and Superwoman. Wherever I went, I couldn't help being a superman or I couldn't die. And then I got interested in plants. Garden is a space of thought in the West. Philosophers were lost in speculation as they walked through the garden. Slow culture. And I thought it would restore rhythm to the lives of Superman's tired "" fast. "" And so I looked around our gardens and I said, "" If you draw a picture of a landscape of the countryside, all of our kids would circle around. "" I hope that the culture of enjoying the field I've designed and refined will grow. Pretty flowers bloom on the edge of the field, and the idea of selling a cluster of pretty potted plants and seed shovels on one side will mean more than just land to eat.

Daum Communications started its construction in 2004 after it decided to relocate its office building to Jeju Island, which began its construction in 2012.

Leafy and air-cleaning plant species are also enjoying continued popularity. Recently, the interest in aerial plants is high, which are effective in absorbing dust and other materials without taking up much space. As more people want to grow plants indoors in a small room, small-volume potted plants are preferred. If you attach your heart to growing plants, you can become an expert and make small profits, said Shim Pol, the CEO. "" Plants are as sensitive to the environment as animals or people are. Water is not enough to make you wet. If you water too often, too much, the plant can drown, too. The rule of giving once every few days is dangerous. The speed at which the soil dries varies with the season and indoor environment can make the mistake of not checking the plant condition properly. The best way is to touch the pot and feel the moisture. It is best to water the soil once when it is quite dry. And the most common error that beginners make is ventilation. I wonder if I can keep the windows closed because plants clean the air, but I can choke to death when the air is stuffy. You need adequate ventilation every day and adequate sunshine to keep plants healthy and long.

The so-called ' kimchi premium ', which is more expensive than the overseas exchange, is also expanding. Kimchi premium is a buzzword virtual currency that has become widely used as a gimp on various online sites to serve as a hot paper for the virtual currency investment boom. As of 11:47 a.m. on July 7, Bitcone is down 4.17 percent from the previous day to 25.8 million won. It is currently down but is up 30 percent from the initial price of 19 million won, when traded at 24.8 million won, up 0.49 percent from Bitsum. Bitchin's price dropped from 21 million won to 18 million won after the government announced its special measures on Dec. 28 last year. However, after recovering to the 19 million won range in the New Year, the price has risen to the 25 million won range. The government said it would enforce the real-name policy for virtual currency transactions by issuing special measures following banning minors from trading virtual currencies. Virtual accounts that are not allowed to be identified by themselves are prohibited from being used, and can only be paid by bank accounts on the virtual currency exchange from January of this year when the account is confirmed by the operator. The related industries predicted that the transaction real-name system would naturally discourage kimchi premiums, which led to the inflow of speculative capital into the country. Kimchi premium means the difference in price between the overseas virtual currency exchange and the local exchange, that is, virtual currency is sold more expensively on the local exchange than on the foreign exchange. The current global average market price for Bitcone is 8.8.8 million won, 35.9 percent higher than the domestic price of 24.8 million won traded on the wet market, according to the agency. The ratio of premium to premium is increasing just 30 percent. Until June last year, the premium for kimchi was only around 5 percent.The Kimchi premium demonstrates that the demand for virtual currency is as strong in Korea. In fact, the biggest reason why kimchi premiums take place was due to an increase in the number of domestic virtual currency buyers in the short run. The number of domestic buyers was only about one million until June, but the figure has increased to three million in December. It will also take some time when virtual money, usually developed abroad, is delivered to buyers through the exchange. The delay also causes prices to rise further when they are shipped to South Korea, where buyers are more prevalent than other countries. Another reason why the Chinese government's ban on virtual currency is that speculative foreign capital is pouring in as well, is the fact that the premium on kimchi is particularly strong. Using the difference in prices between the overseas exchange and the domestic exchange, one can enjoy profit by selling virtual money locally and then selling it again. In fact, there were many users who bought and sold Bitcons from overseas exchange stores until December 12 last year when banks blocked the transfer of money abroad. However, when the real-name transaction system becomes reality, the market could cool down as the inflow of money laundering and speculation capital becomes relatively difficult. Under the real-name transaction system, one can only deposit and withdraw money when the identified dealer's account is in the same bank account, which in turn reduces China's ' speculation on the virtual currency. ' Commercial banks plan to complete the system construction within this month.China's outspoken demand for Chinese tourists is growing around the world.Kim Kyung-ho, a reporter for the newspaper, covered it.◀ Report : Palau, an island country in the Pacific called the Garden of the Gods, changes its color several times a day.More than 110,000 people visit the tiny island country, more than half of them Chinese.China has informed Palau that it will not send a tourist unless it cuts diplomatic ties with Taiwan, and the government is taking a strong stand.All 20 countries already in Taiwan and establish diplomatic relations with the Chinese government pressure events in the same situation last in 2011, against the Senkaku Islands dispute the sovereignty of the islands.Japan's pro-democracy protests in 2014, a mainland China, Hong Kong, and, in 2016, anti-Chinese nature of the government to stop, a big blow.However, the Chinese government's stance remained the same.[Foreign Ministry spokesman HuachuningChinese (20th of last month)] ["" I've never heard of Yuker Control, etc. I don't know anything about the Southern Hemisphere and about anything related to the conflict in the south.

"▽ Quadruple navigation control system and operation of the airport 〓 The sun is rising behind the control tower of Incheon International Airport Terminal 2. [Introduction of the official news item of Youngjong=Confederence News] and Incheon International Airport's reporter Kim Ki-Hoon said on July 18 An Incheon International Airport Authority official said on July 7, "" An aircraft needs to be able to cruise safely. "" He said, "" We need to build up the most sophisticated cooperation in a number of areas and build up a backup system with a stable navigation system. "" ◇ New navigation control system, safer, ’’ Incheon International Airport Corporation completed construction of a new navigation control system in August last year before opening the second terminal. For stability, the antenna with a fiberglass cover is also used to make the changes in the external environment less affected by snow and rain. Mode S antenna not only detected moving objects, but also collected various operational information, including flight number names and altitude, to improve control. In particular, the new navigation control system has improved reliability by upgrading its existing dual-backup system to four systems. The two countries have set up safety measures to ensure that navigation control is not affected in emergencies, such as fires. ◇ Update to congested area of travel safety The advanced ground movement guidance and control system at Incheon Airport (A-SMGCS) is an optimal way to track the positioning of moving objects at an airport, such as aircraft and vehicles. Incheon Airport introduced the world's first feature to derive the optimal route of travel for each aircraft through the system and automatically light up the runway. In addition, the corporation has developed a function to automatically identify the stop location of vehicles depending on the location of the aircraft before the second terminal is opened. More than 1,000 planes land on and carry on board at Incheon Airport and approximately 10,000 vehicles are operating in the area, including loading, servicing and refueling operations. The new system then uses surveillance radar data to detect the direction of movement of the aircraft and, if the aircraft enters a vehicle within 300 meters of the vehicle, improves the safety and effectiveness of ground movements. ◇ All operation information at a glance … Introducing a collaborative decision system It is tempting to introduce an airport collaborative decision system (A-CDM) in the field of flight information management. A-CDM is a system that is shared in real time by each entity involved in operating the airport. The flight process from arrival to departure was divided into 16 stages and 41 visual information was generated depending on each situation to be shared by the airport operator, controller, airline and ground operator. Once departure aircraft's operational status information is available, the airline adjusts the placement of its personnel in anticipation of passenger boarding and run-up to flight, and the controller adjusts the departure order of the aircraft (flight departure forecast time information sharing) and the departure order of the aircraft in question. "" Information sharing has helped us to prioritize the personnel and resources that are put into aircraft operations, and to efficiently utilize our airport facilities, including our parking lots, to help us resolve the congestion, "" said a construction official. kihun@yna.co.krCheck out the detailed weather.

A basic gimbap row is 2,000 won, and a bowl of regular ramen is 350 won. Although snack restaurants are growing on the streets, customers can not choose them as long as they see their prices.
