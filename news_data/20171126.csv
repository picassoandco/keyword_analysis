Mugabe recently stepped down as president and compensation level above the $ 10 million (108 million shares, five million won) were guaranteed immunity 'a wad of bills' and family Sunday edition of the Guardian.'Observer' reported on August 25. According to the paper, Mugabe earlier in the week, Emerson eumnangageu and ZANU ' the ruling party agreed during and close to the new president.The Patriotic Front ' (- pf zanu) a senior figure said. The exact figures were not confirmed, but Mugabe's money was estimated at $ 10 million. Five million dollars out of them are received immediately in cash and the rest take months. Retired Zimbabwe dictator Mugabe [AP = picture of Yonhap news release] Mr. Mugabe reportedly received immunity from prosecution and no threat of violating his family's interests. The eldest son of the wife, Mrs Mugabe, Russell Goressa, (33) owns a large stake in the lucrative Zimbabwe mining project, and has a wide range of businesses for the Mugabe family. Mugabe also could receive $ 150,000 a year until he dies. After Mugabe's death, his wife Grace, 52, who is notorious for her extravagance, is found to receive half of Mugabe's salary. Mr. and Mrs. Mugabe can also continue to live in luxury mansions and receive medical protection from the government, and benefits from butler and security personnel, all while traveling abroad. Douglas Mbonzora, Secretary-General of the main opposition Democratic Change Alliance (MDC), said, "" I don't know if there was such a deal, "" but "" if there was an unconstitutionality with money or something. "" Rep. On the other independents but ""There is no poor country that can so that a former president."" said Mugabe's rights for granted. Oberbar said Zimbabwe's currency had gone to waste, remained in debt, poor and lost more than 80 percent of its jobs during Mugabe's rule. Furthermore, roads were deep, no electricity was turned on in the countryside and the medical system was terrible, adding, "" Zimbabwe's population is expected to live up to 60 years, one of the lowest in the world.

But, although the handwriting on the U.S.World of Europe's traditional printing company, the metal type printing company and the National Museum of Photography 19 When Dutch font designer Martin Major was invited to Korea three times to be surprised by Jikji, he wanted to visit the scene of the Koryo Metal Yolder, which was invented before Goethe. Major designed excellent fonts from Scala, a classic font design in the 1990s, to the latest Questa. The warm-hearted scalar is the most popular Roman font, along with Helvetica, Meta, and Dean (DIN).The printing of Gutenburg-style metal types, invented around 1450, and the printing of metal type "" Jikji printed in 1377, "" are all about to take pictures of books with the cultural details and with the fabricated letters. Practice both ways and you can feel the obvious difference in your body. There were three moments when Martin, who had insight into the difference at the Cheongju Museum of Goinstock, wowed and stopped. "" In the Gutenburg`s type, cheaper lead is the main material, and tin and antimony are used. If copper was so important, it would have cost a lot. "" Korean metal type is copper type, while Gutenberg`s metal type is lead type. If you compare the gamutut-turned lead with the affluent gold sensitive copper type, it looks different in style and dignity. But as concerns remained over Martin's face, the ' tribute to riches ' was not always positive. Copper based copper type was too expensive to spread. The modern spirit of type is at a disadvantage. Korean traditional metal type printing methods rarely use lead or iron as their main material, but they were usually made of bronze, an alloy of copper and tin. Bronze is also referred to as brass, and the more tin it contains, the more red the copper becomes. The fact that any metal could have dared to be cast into metal objects as precise and difficult to handle as type means that the society was accumulating high levels of metal technology. Unlike the Gutenburg-style metal type printing technology, which was quickly adopted by merchants and replaced death completely in book printing, Korean traditional metal type printing was carried out from Goryeo to Joseon Dynasty for hundreds of years. Private people still used economic wooden boards and neck type, and it was common for Korean novels to be hand-traveled in the latter half of Joseon Dynasty and in the early enlightenment period. "" How smart Koreans are, "" Martin Major, who prints the way as a Korean rub. Martin was puzzled. "" Where is the printing press? "" Soon after confirming that there was no printing press, the expression became clear after a series of inferences. "" You mean the paper gets type without the help of a printing press? I wish the paper handling was excellent! Koreans are very smart. "" One noticeable difference in the metal type printing technology of Gutenberg and Jikji is the existence of printing machines. If the lever of a large furniture size machine was pulled hard in Europe, it could be printed in Korea simply by rubbing it with paper. Unfortunately, Korean traditional printing has become disconnected from modern life and remains only a realm of handicraft reproduced by a few artisans. When the Park Mun-guk was founded in 1883, Western modern printing was brought in through Japan, and traditional copper printing was soon replaced by the new type of lead-type printing. The digital machine environment in which we use Hangeul continues to be the Gutenburg`s model. Why don't we explain why the tradition of technology we boast about has been replaced by that of other cultures in today's everyday life? For a variety of reasons, the Western world has been able to rapidly increase its mass production by improving the printing machines. But the lack of a printing press was not due to the lack of Goryeo technology, but rather to its excellence, Professor Jun Sang-woo explains in his book, "" Korean History of Science. "" The invention of metal type printing involves the comprehensive synthesis of several inventions in detail. In the East or the West, yes or now, the whole process is largely metal-casting, input, composition and output ("" casting "" shall be font made, "" type "" in "" and print out ""), and document in question. Although China invented paper, Korea produced excellent quality paper by improving its own printing techniques from Unified Silla. Dakpape from Goryeo had a softer surface than its western crisp paper, so the type of paper could be scratched by hand without a heavy printing press, leaving a physical mark on it. We just didn't need a printing press. "" Koreans use chopsticks to print in type! "" The type was set using chopsticks. Among the printing tools, there were chopsticks. But he was proud to come to Korea and say he mastered using chopsticks. When she found out that Koreans are a people who even pick up type with chopsticks, she laughed cheerfully. Eastern and Western metal type printing methods have these very different mechanisms, and they have many different elements of creative invention. Even if one admits this, the meaning of Korean metal type printing as the world's first invention will not fade away. The invention shows that the fact that the demand for books was not high, and that Goryeo was a society that respected records, knowledge and learning, and achieved a high standard of science. This fact has been officially recognized by UNESCO and is also stated by libraries and museums in Germany and France. Knowing yourself and myself and our difference exactly is believed to be the way to love your culture.

Out of the nine students who were in their third year of high school, only one was admitted. According to the admission industry and Daegu Metropolitan Office of Education, the number of students who complete the CSAT was estimated to be five in the natural and four in the humanities, respectively, which is 9 in total. The exact number of perfect candidates will be confirmed when the official notice of their scores is made on July 12. The absolute evaluation of English language areas and Korean history are considered perfect scores when the number of points per grade 1 reference line is over 90 and 40. The Daegu Metropolitan Office of Education announced that two students out of every student and graduate earned perfect scores in Daegu based on the results of their provisional attachment tests. The perfect student is Unam High School senior Kang Hyun-kyu, and graduate from Deokwon High School is Lee Soo-hyun. Kang is the only student so far known to have made it to the Korean Scholastic Aptitude Test. The town of Unam in which the army travels is not located in what is called an "" education zone "" but in the Buk-gu area. Daegu Metropolitan Office of Education officials said Kang, without relying on private tutoring or private tutoring, has faithfully engaged in school education activities and has set the target quota for his own performance, a statement said.

According to the investigation authorities on July 26, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) found additional documents on the investigation response form which was reported to the senior presidential secretary for civil affairs in 2013 when Nam-Jae-jun was the head of the NIS's office. In a report to the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae at the time, the NIS said, "" Prosecutors ' special investigation team led by Yun Seok-yeol, the current chief prosecutor of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office, had serious problems in human composition, and recommended that many cases be replaced.

The NIS said some prosecutors stressed the need to replace prosecutors when they pointed out the history of student movement during their time in college and the region from which they graduated. The reports were compiled under the leadership of the National Intelligence Service, including key NIS officials such as Chang Ho-jung, then deputy chief of the Seocheon Unit 2 and former chief of the National Inspection Service. The NIS said as he is ""The very fate of the (Park Geun-hye), the regime of the case.""

Prosecutors are also investigating whether Nam was involved in any legal interference, including attempts to disrupt the investigation teams.Nam Jae-jun, former head of the NIS, formed a special investigation team with the head of the Prosecutors ' Office in 2013 to investigate the truth behind the comments, but there were controversies over external pressure at every major point. In particular, the Justice Ministry, led by Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, was involved in the investigation after Prosecutor General Chae Dong-wook resigned in September that year amid an abrupt controversy over out-of-wedlock couples. There were rumors of a possible bribery scandal between the investigation team and the justice and prosecution. Yoon was found to have supported certain parties or posted messages against them on Twitter about 50,000 times in addition to comments by Won Se-hoon, but the top three of the NIS officials declined to confirm the charges. Afterwards, the prosecutor general was excluded from the investigation and the team leader was replaced by Lee Jung-hoe, current director of the prosecution's scientific investigation planning bureau.

Keep the news of the North Korean defection from the South Korean Central News Agency (Yonhap) and the South Korean military authorities operating in the North Korea Central News Agency (Yonhap News Agency) Military officials said Friday that the FM radio by a loudspeaker of the North was the main news item on the news following the North Korea`s defection from its military in the JSA on July 13. The North Korean broadcast network has been running the news continuously, ranging from the story of the North Korean defection to the status of the defectors who are being treated at the hospital in Ajudae. After the release of the video footage of the JSA CC by the United Nations Command on July 22, it was revealed that the North Korean military pursuit team fired a shot south of the Military Demarcation Line and that some of the armistice agreement were violated. A loudspeakers also pointed out the nutrition status of North Korean soldiers who recently escaped from the border town of Panmunjeom is known, pointing out that many North Korean soldiers are malnourished. The North Korean military's dramatic escape from the shooting rampage in the pursuit group is expected to have no small influence on the North's military mentality in the frontline areas. Military authorities resumed a joint broadcast of loudspeakers from more than 10 of the forefront in January last year to counter North Korea`s fourth nuclear test. High power sound is transmitted from 10 to 20 kilometers in front of the station.Military authorities say that the CCTV footage of North Korea's defection from the Joint Chiefs of Staff shows a significant impact on psychological warfare against the North Korean military. It is known that the North Korean defector who crossed the Central Front in June reportedly made a statement to the effect that listening to a loudspeaker on the North Korean peninsula affected his decision to defect. It was not confirmed whether or not the North Korean soldiers who defected via the JSA heard the broadcasts of a loudspeaker from the North, but Lee Kook-jong, a professor at Aju University Hospital, said defectors were familiar with South Korean girl groups ' music. The government proposed to the North last July to hold military talks to ease tension in the frontline areas and was also expected to broadcast a loudspeaker against the North, but the North did not respond. Meanwhile, the military authorities are reportedly planning to launch a joint newspaper on defectors with the National Intelligence Service as soon as they improve. The defectors were recently transferred from the intensive care unit to the general hospital. ljglory@yna.co.kr"
"It's already the sixth time this year. It was only three days from the last accident. A U.S. Navy carrier crashed on Japan's Okinawa coast on Friday. The plane was returned to the Reagan carrier in the Philippines after a joint operation with Japan's Self-Defense Forces. The cause of the accident is suspected to be a propeller engine fault. Among the 11 passengers, eight were rescued, but three were missing.The U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet at Yokosuka naval base in Japan operates the entire Asia-Pacific area, including the Korean Peninsula. It is the core strength of the U.S. Navy, with sixty ships, 350 airplanes, and sixty thousand soldiers. The seven-flight fleet is responsible for the security of the Korean Peninsula from North Korea's nuclear and missile provocations. The Aegis class ship is equipped with a range of high-tech equipment priced at more than 1.6 trillion won. Because of this, the traps are considered very shocking when only one safety accident occurs.On those seven ships, as I said, there have been six accidents this year. So it's hard to even explain how much impact that would have on us. In June and August, an Aegis destroyer collided with a merchant ship, killing 17 crew members. The incident was blamed for a series of repairs, but the incident did not stop. Why did the American fleet, once considered the greatest, become the "" worst accident squadron ""?● Key causes of accidents can be complex ; however, experts point to "" excessive work by the crew "" as the main cause of accidents. US Navy Forces are evaluated in terms of ‘ operational deployment ’, ‘ maintenance and training ’ and ‘ certification of mission performance ’ every two years. It is called the ‘ rotational readiness cycle ’. A report from the 2015 U.S. Government Accounting Department found that destroyers deployed on the U.S. mainland were approximately allocated an operational deployment time of 40 % / maintenance and training.Seven fleet vessels were assigned 67 percent operational deployment / 33 percent training and repair. There was no special period for training at all. The message of this statistic is short-lived. As the 7th Fleet is relatively frequent in operations, it is inevitable that it will be negligent in maintenance, re-charge and training.It's called. In particular, North Korea's repeated provocations with China over the South China Sea have caused the seven-flight crew to work harder. In that sense, the loss of focus and the ability of the crew to work may be a natural consequence.Excessive work also decreases the basic combat power of the crew. About 30 percent of all ship crew members are new arrivals each year. Of course, it takes time to get used to new jobs, new equipment, and new teamwork. However, excessive work takes away these "" essential times. "" In fact, 17 percent of the ship's crew members pointed out that their certification of qualifications for operations had expired. The New York Times also criticized the tight schedule of the seventh fleet, saying, "" Bus drivers don't work like seven-man fleet soldiers. ""Some blame it for not being able to hold it together in such a way that it is not enough, that the commander of the Pacific Fleet or the commander of the Seventh Fleet is assigned an Air Force officer, who has long served as the commander in a trap. At the same time, suspicious crew members were also envious of land jobs and avoid dangerous pitfall services to keep their jobs in line, which led to the reduction of ship-skilled and capable sailors.● Maintenance defect caused by budget reduction is another cause of an accident as well as excessive work. Recent vessels are relying on high-tech electronic equipment such as electronic maps and navigation systems. High-tech equipment is taking over many of the roles that our older, more knowledgeable managers have played. These systems are operated on the premise of thorough maintenance checks and management. However, there has been criticism recently that the associated budget has decreased, and that the equipment has become less checked and maintained.The U.S. Department of Defense's Office of Accounting said the reduction in the defense budget in 2012 led to delays and poor maintenance. They also said the parts are often supplied poorly. They say it is more noticeable in water vessels, especially vessels deployed overseas, than in airplanes or submarines. As a result, the overall maintenance posture has continued to drop and the number of accidents due to malfunction of the equipment has increased.Of course, there is a stern view that blaming the third factor for the accident is irresponsible. U.S. fleet commander Scott Switz pointed out that the recent incident occurred during the most basic solo voyage, not during tactical situations that required combat formation, maneuvers, blackout and radio control. In other words, the problem was the ease with which the sailors were at sea and the lack of control. In short, it's a clear human error that occurred because even the most fundamental things were not kept.● It may not be the world's biggest navy, but it is not the best navy. '' Regardless of the cause, Messi is very stern in dealing with the recent seven fleet safety accidents. Most importantly, the area in which the accident happened is the most serious security area. As North Korea continues to provoke its nuclear weapons and missiles, the U.S. Seventh Fleet operates six to seven Aegis destroyers and cruisers to detect and intercept North Korean missiles. Under these circumstances, the accidental loss of valuable assets will have a negative effect on our security.It is also worrisome that the credibility and status of the U.S. Navy, which was regarded as the world's best, has been flawed. The U.S. Navy has been committed to the Asia-Pacific region's maritime security since World War II, and to helping it promote global economic development. The U.S. Navy is also currently in charge of containing China's aggressive expansion of the ocean, and a series of accidents are beginning to question the role. Because of this, critics say, "" The U.S. Navy may be the largest navy in the world, but it doesn't seem to be the best. ""● Disaster and distress always arises from a stack of trivial things, '' wrote Song, a scholar of great oil, Gu Yang-su, in the book, a poem written by Yeongnanseo, is written by HolmI, a wreath. Misfortune and anxiety always build up from the smallest, meaning that a man does not often stumble over a huge stone, but easily falls on a tiny rock he once regarded as a lesser stone. That is, you can avoid large stones because they are easily visible, but small stones are not visible, so you can fall over them.The enemies you see may be easy to defeat. Rather, it can be more difficult to defeat an invisible, neglected enemy. It's very hard and difficult to operate the trap well for a long time in the ocean. However, that's the basics. A. Fighting the enemy is the next level. I hope that the United States Navy, a close ally of the Republic of Korea, can heal the wounds well and unite with the ROK Navy to ensure sea security.[Relevant Report] Daniel's Sixth Flight Only This Year … U.S. Seventh Fleet carrier crash, Why? ※ People's Library and Culture University Military Professor Jurandseob in South Korea () 前 vt), U.S. Navy Chief of Staff, and Staff."
"After losing ground, they used their flags and started a race to see who was tougher. The devastated Sunni armed forces in Iraq and Syria are feared to have shown signs of being alive in a brutal, democracy-maximizing attack.As if the terrorist attacks on Egypt's Sinai Peninsula's Bir al-Arabed mosque, when the county's armed wing of the Allada Mosque opened on Friday, the residents of the Union News Agency announced Friday that they were investigating After noon on July 24, 25 to 30 gunmen arrived at the mosque by dividing into five sports utility vehicles (SUVs), went on strike, positioning themselves in the temple gates and in 12 windows. They surrounded the mosque and fired indiscriminate shootings and blasts at some 500 believers as the imam began its sermon. Witnesses reported strong gunfire and blasts occurred before the gunmen entered the mosque. The attack killed at least 305 people including 27 children and 128 others injured. `` No one has escaped an injured mosque, '' Ahmad al-Muslim Fatthah's brother Ahmad told AFP. The imam was also wounded by a bullet in the foot and is too shocked to speak, Ahmad said. Even after the attack, the terrorists showed bold and organized behavior by setting fire to the cars, blocking roads and running in perfect order.The "" Black Flag, "" or "" Black Flag, "" held up inside the Allada mosque in Egypt's Vir al-Arbed province on July 24 (local time), with flags and a display of deadly force. No group has claimed to be behind the terrorist attacks yet, but speculation over the work of IS Egyptian branch has been gaining ground. The Sinai Peninsula is an area frequently attacked by extremist groups such as IS. The IS Egypt chapter, which is based on the male peninsula, has repeatedly carried out attacks on Egyptian soldiers, soldiers, and soldiers, and soldiers. The IS Egypt branch claimed to be behind the crash of a Russian commercial jet in October 2015, in which a total of 324 passengers were killed. The attacks suggested that although IS lost key bases in Iraq and Syria, its regional affiliates remained intact. "" The removal of the ' caliphate ' was not particularly influenced by the local chapter of IS, "" said Daniel Benjamin Datmouth, a professor at the University of Washington who conducted the U.S. State Department's counterterrorism. The terrorists did not seize territory or gather new followers, but focused on casualties. The most brutal attack could be aimed at showing that IS is still under threat, and it could signal a power struggle for IS control by the affiliates, WP analyzed.The "" Muslim Shampoonist Mosque "" that is currently under way outside Ismailia Hospital on July 25 (local time) [AFP = United News] ◇ Muslims ' religious cult following the "" mystique "" exploded. Qulan and Shimpah, who seek to combine with God rather than with Kuran, have been ostracized as heresy by extremist organizations and conservative Sunnis, including IS. Circumspection, which avoids materialism, seeks God from within, tolerance to other ideas, and respect cultural diversity, are predominant. IS, who sees only their faith as valid, has targeted suffism. IS's priority as the "" moral policeman "" on the men's peninsula, according to IS propaganda media, is "" to fight polytheism, including suffism. "" As a result, Supipa Shrine and temples have become the targets of IS several times in the Middle East and South Asia. IS killed more than 70 people in February of this year by a suicide bombing at Sufifa's Holy Land in southern Pakistan's Shind Province. They "" carry out Islamic taboo magic "" and have kidnapped or decapitated Sufi leaders. Western experts see the mass slaughter of Muslims demonstrates the urgency IS feels after deferring from its Middle East base. Sufipa holy sites and temples have been the targets of IS, but facilities in Egypt, where Sunni Muslims, like IS, have been rooted in the country's wars.

"Financial Services Commission announced Monday that the Financial Services Commission, which is in charge of issuing the loans and the interest on existing loans, has become more difficult from the second. From January next year, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) will not be able to buy more than two homes with mortgage loans (the following amounts). If the financial institution lends money to someone who has already received the loan, they will look at the existing loan as well as the new loan ; at the same time, they will give out a second mortgage over the next 15 years. The main item in the Financial Services Commission's "" Measures to Advance the Credit Examination "" on July 26 was a loan payment mechanism that would ensure a more thorough payment of the new (DTI) and the ability to repay debts. First of all, the new DTI will be introduced next January. Traditionally, the new shares were divided by the annual income of the principal, interest, and other lending interests, and gave out the loans based on the ratio. Those who receive more than one from each bank will reflect both the principal and interest of the existing stock, not to mention the new one when calculating DTI's. The DTI is higher than before, so the amount of loans available is decreased. In addition, the financial firm will look at two years of income after checking only one year of income of the borrowers. Financial institutions should check objective data, such as the amount of income withholding receipts, at the time. In such cases, the estimated income is decreased by 5 % and 10 %, and the maximum limit on loans is limited to 50 million won, respectively. Prove two years of income, not one year ...Increased future income could lead to more loans, and the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) is expected to increase when it calculates the increase in the long-term future income of borrowers who submit their income documents regardless of their age. Previously, future earnings could only be reflected for workers under the age of 40 and without homes. In addition, those who receive more than two loans will have a limit of 15 years in maturity. The longer the loan is repaid, the easier it is to get the loan because the yearly mortgage principals and interest burden is to decrease. This applies only to DTI calculation and the actual debt payment periods can exceed 15 years. The Financial Services Commission also arranged a measure to prevent the introduction of the new DTI from harming the working class and residents. Young people, newlyweds, do not have to justify two years of earning and can be given a higher limit than the average loan applicant. Sohn Byung-doo, director of the Financial Services Commission, said, I will explain that the income is not the same as previous years, because it is not easy to prove that young people have short social lives.  In addition, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) said that if the company submits a contract to sell existing homes, the existing mortgage loan company will have to pay only the interest on the DTI when it receives two short-term rental apartments. In addition, if the government agrees to dispose of existing homes within two years or pay off existing ones, it will not apply limiting the maturity of the second house to 15 years. Although the DTI is not able to over-loan but the high level of DSR loans....The Bank can make its own judgment and introduce a DSR that examines all loans, not just mortgage loans from borrowers, starting in the fourth quarter of next year. Non-Bank will be introduced from the second fiscal quarter of 2019. The new DTI income method is used to check a loan applicant's income, but if it is difficult to identify the income, financial institutions can review and deal with DSRs. For example, for some credit loans without evidence income, the method can be classified as a high DSR loan and then managed separately by financial firms. Financial authorities plan to allow banks to set the DSR ratio freely by the fourth quarter of next year. First of all, the financial institutions will let DSR utilize the high lending rate by maintaining a constant level. Lee Hyung-ju, director of the financial policy bureau at the Financial Services Commission, explained in response, Unlike the DTI, the bank should not refuse to lend even if it passed the DSR management index (which is to be created in the fourth quarter of next year). He added, We are limiting the share of DSR at all scales to a certain extent, adding, Now we are doing so because we have never had related statistics before. This means that one can review the DSR ratio and how to utilize it after watching the situation. In addition, the financial authorities will introduce a loan screening system for individual businesses and real estate rental loans. Financial institutions are required to designate three or more businesses to manage, considering the size of loans and the rate of increase in loans, and set credit limits for each sector. In addition, when lending to real estate rental workers, the financial institutions will calculate the rate of interest to determine if the loans are appropriate. Meanwhile, financial authorities expect the new DTI to lower the growth rate of banks by 0.16 %. In addition, financial authorities predict that the new DTI will affect about 3.6 percent of new home mortgage borrowers, or 8.3 percent, of whom are to apply for mortgage loans.

"Starting January next year, the government will first impose strict DTI to income ratio regulations in metropolitan areas and speculative areas.The Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service announced Monday a plan to advance the screening process of new DTI's. This is a characteristic of the comprehensive household debt package, which was introduced on July 24.The new DTI is the annual income distribution of all mortgage principals and interests on all home equity loans, not mortgage loans. The current DTI is divided into annual incomes by adding the principal of new home mortgage loans and other lending interests, including existing mortgage loans. As the new DTI is the core of the mortgage loan, the total available loan amount will be decreased.In fact, the average lending per capita by Kookmin Bank in the first half of this year is estimated to be 270 million won, down 12.1 percent from 258 million won.◇ All States divided by loan periods … A key factor in DTI's annual payment account payment plan for those under the age of 40 is the loan period. Renting the same amount of money, the longer the loan period, the less money one owes per year, and the more rentable one can borrow.For example, suppose you rent 500 million won as 10 years of maturity, the annual repayment burden is 50 million won (500,000,000 years) when it comes to a full amortization. The grace period is excluded from the loan period ; with the two years of grace the yearly principal payment amount is 27.8 million won (500,188 years), and the five-year grace period is 33.3 million won (550,500 years).A temporary payment by using the principal amount of a loan to maturity is granted up to 10 years at the longest period of time. In this case, the annual principal payment amount will grow to 50 million won (500 million won / 10 years).For multiple home owners, the loan period will be up to 15 years, regardless of the actual loan period, when calculating the DTI from the second mortgage loan.The new DTI is also slightly different from the current DTI in its analysis of annual income. First, the income for the year is identified, not just the income for the year, but also for the past two years.If the income is significantly variable (± 20 %) from the previous year, the average of the income for the two years is applied. However, if the sustainability of the increased income, such as promotion, is proven, only recent income is reflected.If the latest income is less than one year, 10 % is deducted from converting to yearly income. If it is found that there are unavoidable reasons, such as leave of absence, and the sustainability of the income, the amount should not be deducted.If the member can not submit a documented income due to reasons such as non-employment, the member shall pay 95 % of the reported income (income reflected in payment such as national pension) or rent.Without a mortgage on a spouse's home, his or her income is added to her annual income. If one's spouse has a credit loan rather than a mortgage, the interest will be added to the annual principal payment amount.Young people (homeless below the age of 40) and newly married couples (within five years of marriage) adjust their future earnings higher than normal borrowers when acknowledging prospective incomes.If two mortgage loans are secured due to inevitable reasons, such as moving, when the existing home is disposed of immediately, only the interest rate will be reflected on the DTI but excluding the principal amount of existing home mortgage loans. If an existing dwelling is to be disposed of within two years and the existing mortgage is also pledged to be repaid, the new loan will not be subject to a maturity limit (15 years).◇ New DTI (2-house mortgage loan), up to 50 % lower than the previous month, and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) explained to the Korea Financial Services Commission (FSS) how the mortgage loan amount of the mortgage loan market, which is designed to be divided into interest rates, was different.In case the mortgage loan (mortgage loan amount : 180 million won, interest rate : 3.5 %, divided by 20 year) is adjusted to be fixed at least 4 % due to the reduction of the mortgage payment amount of the apartment to be adjusted as a result of 30 year.As a result, the maximum amount of loans the existing DTI calculation method can be obtained is 399 million won.According to the new DTI, the owner first has to choose whether to dispose of the existing house within two years. If disposed of, the maximum limit of mortgage loans for new home mortgage loans (15 years) does not apply, thus, the limit on loans is 297 million won. It is a reduction of 92 million won (23.7 percent) compared to the previous DTI.However, if existing houses are not disposed of, the maximum limit on their maturity is imposed, so the amount of loans will drop to less than half.That is, even though the bank has a 30-year contract to pay off a new loan, it is calculated that the DTI must be paid off within 15 years. The maximum loan ceiling will be 184 million won, down 52.7 percent from the previous month.In some cases, the new DTI will increase the lending rate. If a homeless worker with a documented income of 35 million won and an Olhi 940 million won buys an apartment to be adjusted next year and can take out a loan with a maturity of 200 million won, the current DTI calculation is set.According to the new DTI, the bank calculates the expected earnings for Mr B. The most recent income is 40 million won, but it is estimated to increase in income in the future, and it is multiplied by 1.31. The rates may vary slightly from bank to bank. The estimated future income is 52.39 million won.The limit of his loan, which reflects only an increase in his expected future income, will increase to 385 million won, or 91.0 million won (31.0 percent). Because B has no mortgage loan with no home owners, there is no effect on the increase of molecules by the new DTI.The goal is to establish an advanced credit screening practice based on the ability to repay the debt, said Sohn Byung-doo, head of the Financial Supervisory Commission.[reporter Kwon Soon-wan directly to Dongsan.com] - Compritations ⓒ Chosun Ilbo & Chosun.com, No reproduction or redistribution without permission"
"○ Joint gate installed in the tunnel of DMZ for 72 hours by soldiers / two trees along the route to defection from North Korea Any act that could obstruct the vision of the guards could violate a ceasefire agreement.According to photo interpretation by the U.S. and South Korean authorities on July 26, North Korean military authorities are installing obstacles on the route that North Korean soldiers defected to. First, a soldier who defected from the North finished setting up a gate in North Korea on a 72-hour bridge with a military jeep. The 72-hour bridge was built in August 1976 when the DMZ was relocated from the joint control point to the installment control point after the Axe Behaviour Incident. Given the presence of security forces at the gate, it is believed that the gate needs to be screened for North Korean vehicles and personnel to pass the bridge. When the escaped soldier could not move the jeep because it was stuck on the concrete chin, he dug a ditch more than 1m deep in the passage and planted two trees in front of it. It appears that the vehicle or person has been placed in a way that prevents them from crossing the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) using this route. It is also suspected that the ditch was equipped with iron skewers.U.S. Ambassador to Korea Mark Napper posted a photo on his Twitter account of North Korean laborers using shovels and digging ditches to protect the North's armed forces. "" North Koreans planted two trees in the JSA and they dug trenches, or ditches, at the point where North Korean soldiers crossed the border, "" Napper said.U.S. Ambassador to Korea Mark Naffer posted a photo on his Twitter of North Korean soldiers digging a ditch at the Joint Security Area (Joint Security Area) at Panmunjeom on July 23. The North Korean army recently dug a ditch where a defector tried to defect to the JSA. ▽ New Sis…North Korean soldiers planting two trees could violate the armistice by blocking the sight of our guards. The agreement between the U.N. Forces and the North Korean forces in September 1976 after the tragedy of the DMZ axe was made either to obstruct the installation of their watches, or to ensure the observance of security guarantees, or to ensure their vision. It was agreed to supplement the Agreement on the Safety and Contraction of the Military Intelligence Headquarters, and the Central Area in October 1953.Since it is winter now, there are no leaves on the trees planted by the North Korean army. It is expected to cover the surrounding area when the leaves grow thick during the summer. It is also known that the incident blocked further defection and resulted in the movement of the North Korean military camp to the DMZ with closed circuit (CC) TV or thermal imaging equipment (TOD) being accounted for as a palm reader by Seoul. The newly planted tree could become a spark in the future, as the accident of the axe at Panmunjeom took place in the process of cutting down the cottonwood trees that blocked the view of Korea.North Korea has not revealed its defection through official media. It is expected that the government will continue measures to block further defection, instead of mentioning the defection from the military, as it is worried about possible internal unrest. South Korean military authorities are reportedly broadcasting a loudspeaker on North Korea based areas near the border to report the North Korean soldier's defection from the JSA.Radio Freedom Radio, broadcast by a loudspeaker on North Korea, was heard in relation to the incident following the defection from North Korea's military in the JSA on July 13. The United Nations Command released a CCTV video on July 22 at the Joint Security Area (JSA), firing at the south of the MDL and criticizing the North's armistice agreement by saying some of them crossed the MDL line. A loudspeakers also pointed out the nutrition status of North Korean soldiers who recently escaped from the border town of Panmunjeom is known, pointing out that many North Korean soldiers are malnourished.If the North Korean military gets wind of their escape from the truce village of Panmunjeom despite the shooting of a chase group, it is expected that North Korean troops in the frontline areas will experience a number of psychological fluctuations, including a reduction in morale. Meanwhile, the military authorities plan to launch a joint newspaper with the National Intelligence Service as soon as the operation and the recovering North Korean soldier status improves.psc@segye.com © 5 Kits combine an eye the world press Park Soo Chan, Cheong Wa Dae people petition against global media released from prison World Newspaper jodusun (pg) [make Lee Tae-ho], illustration, composite picture of national interest.Do not stick many cooks spoil the response criteria, and 'Regional trauma center support' effect that a plea agreement said more than 20 million senior adviser to Presiding over meetings and ready answer 靑 the door.President (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) Pai Chai, but Journalist : Moon Jae-in Sunday afternoon is president, a senior aide at a meeting of senior aides at Cheong Wa Dae yeomingwan and smile together.

"A special Jeju trip by a person with a defective repo wheelchair. In particular, this is not only a pleasure but also a lifetime opportunity for the physically handicapped to participate in the world. And by gaining the confidence of being able to go anywhere else, you can be more proactive. But most severely disabled people live around the house. I followed the wheelchair journey of the disabled to Jeju Island, which gives strength and courage to many disabled people who would crouch at home. It is not easy for disabled people in wheelchairs to travel far. However, the rates of participation by disabled people who have been on a trip were very high. Lee Hyun-cheol, head of the Association for the Spinal Spinal Strings in Jangheung-gun, South Jeolla Province, poses with his wife Kim Hyo-soon in front of a kissing sculpture at the Geumneung Stone Park on Jeju Island yesterday. "" It's been exactly 20 years. I visited Jeju Island about ten times before the accident, but I couldn't think of coming. It feels great because it's been a long trip. "" A smile of Binggrae covered Lee Hyun-chul (39), who arrived on Jeju Island on July 20 for a three-day visit. Lee is a severely disabled man who can not move a foot without a wheelchair. In 1998, he injured his cervical vertebrae in a car accident. After a long rehabilitation, you can only move your arms. They don't use their fingers, their arms are sensorial, and their bottom half are numb. His wife Kim Hyo-soon (46), accompanied by Lee, also had a full look on her face. Kim also said, "" This is the first time that Jeju Island has had such a trip since high school excursion 30 years ago. "" I'm glad I haven't been to Jeju in a long time, but honestly, I have never flown in an airplane before. I loved the moment I was about to hop off, and when I flew over the clouds, I felt as if I was in a car with a start-stop. It's just as nice : "" It's possible to find a dream of becoming a great soccer player, Lee Hyun-cheol University, and find out whether Lee Hyun-cheol, former South Korean player, had a spinal cord joint replacement in a car accident, or a trip to Jeju Island with his wife, and a trip to and a trip to Busan to see if Lee Dong-guk and get a license. "" The Jeonnam Murrow Disability Association, with Dodo's financial support, goes on a group tour once a year to its members. This year, the government selected the most preferred destination for the nation's tourist destination, Jeju Island, and recruited its members by town or county branch. Members who could not go on a honeymoon after getting married, or who had been traveling for a long time and who had difficulty living as a beneficiary of basic living were selected as the first choice. That's how 17 people were selected, including nine members and spouses. Lee, who lives in Jangheung, South Jeolla Province, immediately applied to participate when he heard the news. If we lived together and wanted to go on a trip, we would drag us to the ridge between rice paddies in Jangheung. Who are these rice paddies, and when they were ours they sold them to and so forth, they wrote down, "" In the countryside, there weren't many places to go but the rice fields. "" The first day they visited were ' Derma Park ' and the beaches of Wollyeong-ri, Hallim-eup, Jeju. Duma Park is famous for its various arts performed by performers from Mongolia while Wollyeong-ri is famous for its Nakjo. During the afternoon's performance, 300 to 400 tourists visited the park. Lee and her colleagues cheered and clapped freely in the wheelchair. Although the sea route to Wollyeong-ri had some ups and downs, these special travelers of the same class enjoyed the sunshine and sea breeze, just like others. The wind is delicious in Jeju Island. Being cool and clean is like bottled water, "" Kim pushed her husband's wheelchair, sipping a deep, breast-water air. Lee was a soccer player who was so popular that he was picked as the national junior national team before the accident. Lee Dong-guk, who plays for Hyundai in North Jeolla Province, and Lee Jung-soo, who is a leader after retiring from active duty (Suwon Samsung) this year, were both competitors and friends of hers during soccer. It was one Saturday in September 1998 when he was a freshman at Chosun University. While riding a motorcycle to meet her friends, Lee was hit by a car that was making an illegal U-turn in downtown Suncheon. When he woke up at the hospital four days after surgery, he realized that he could not move his hands or feet. When his promising son became disabled overnight after playing soccer in the fourth grade of elementary school, the frustrated father emptied his soju bottle every day. However, Lee was different. "" I lay still for three months, and one day I felt a sensation on my arm. Another month or so later, I felt something on my chest. I thought to myself. She said, "" In three months, my finger and my leg will be restored in three months. "" Lee Hyun-cheol, who took part in a trip to Jeju Island by the Association for the Spindled Spindled People with Disabilities, received a special offer from my wife Kim Hyo-soon on July 20. Although the miracle did not happen due to poor rehabilitation efforts at the start of a chapter of spinal cord injury in Jangheung-gun, Lee was never frustrated or frustrated. He got a driver's license in 2000. When he told a rehabilitation hospital in Incheon that he would go to get a license, all his fellow patients laughed at him, ' What would you do with your car, even if you did? ' After returning home, his mother bought him a used car, even though her father objected to him, and left him indoors for about a year. "" It's been my world since then. I drove around the country. When I saw that, many people looked up to me and said, "" I got a license. Kim was seven years older than her husband, so she spent the first two or three years in a relationship with her sister, and the next four years, she had a serious relationship. "" I didn't like the first impression, but I liked the way I looked when I met her without any lies or decoration. Her family objected, but they pushed for her hand. "" This time, Kim was in trouble when a pretty daughter of two married girls in 2008 got her first birthday. Suddenly, symptoms of movements appeared, such as "" the cartilage in the right leg and arm is broken backwards. "" I went directly to the hospital by my husband's car to find out that I had a brain attack. Lee tried not to show weakness, but when she went to her wife, tears poured down her face. The water was in the eyes of the wife who saw her husband, and the two of them would hold each other and weep for hours. Kim, who had severe symptoms of paralysis in her right arm and leg, worked hard in rehabilitation from the beginning and is now almost well. After experiencing this kind of situation, the two decided to live a life in earnest to help the disabled, as they were. They entered Koguryeok University in Naju and earned certificates as social workers in 2013. It plans to build and operate welfare facilities for the disabled someday. First of all, the military set up the Jangheung-gun Branch of the Society for the Disabled for the first time. She said, "" Although I was a member of the association for the Disabled, I think it is urgent to protect the rights and interests of people with spinal cords who need more care than others. Since the branch office has not yet been recognized as a military support group, all of the office expenses come from the couple's slim pockets. "" If you have any greed, you can't do this. We built a branch to attract people with spinal cord injuries that are found only at home. It may be a hard time for us for the time being, but we are going to keep going, said his pledge, adding his wife Kim. "" If he had started working to take advantage of something, I would have stopped him. It is always positive and I can boast of my strong will to help others. "" The Jeonnam Spinal-Spinning Community, a letter written to his wife, gave each participant a homework. They sent each other a letter telling the other what they had failed to do. After packing her bags at dawn on the day of her departure, she sat at her desk and wrote to her husband. "" I'm so thankful to see you busy these days. She looks very passionate as she runs around saying she wants to do something worthwhile when she's going to be tired and uncomfortable. Looking back on me now, I have learned to be considerate of myself, to understand and to live with myself. "" I can still write my husband a letter in advance, but I can still be grateful to him. "" It's been a lot of changes since I met you, and I've seen you and I've found happiness. Thank you so much for your love and I can't thank you enough with that pen. "" On the second day of the trip, I went to Jeolmul Natural Recreation Forest, the fairy and the woodsman theme park, and in the afternoon I found a museum devoted to Seopjikoji and sex. Jeolmul Natural Recreation Forest and Seopjikoji Pond had an uphill climb, but the party enjoyed the beautiful nature of Cheju Island, helping each other to move on. Jun Kwon-soo, 58, who came from Yeosu with his wife, said, I felt refreshed when I took the first road trip three years ago after my car accident. I hope many disabled people can also travel. Oh Soon-bok (60), who followed her husband, Lee Jae-sul (64), hailed each time she went, saying, I love the opportunity to take a trip to a hotel bathroom, although it is a little uncomfortable. "" Disabilities is just a little uncomfortable for my body, not something to be ashamed of or stared at. Who would let me down just because I'm disabled? Then I'll be the only one who's shabby. I always love and boast about myself as I am. I hope others with disabilities can think and act just like normal people on these trips. "" Lee Hyun-cheol said, "" I just want to hold my spoon in my hand and eat freely."

The exam supervisor was a senior at a high school who took the CSAT this year. Why did university students rediscend the CSAT when they thought about it? The mock test was organized in 2014 by the group Project Crisis, which was set up by students to lead education reform. It is preparing for the reason why university students would want to check by taking another test to see if they have the ability to study at university, or the purpose of evaluating whether or not they have "" math "" to do so today. The mock test involved participants choosing one of the Korean language, mathematics, and English sections to solve this year's CSAT questions. They had experience taking private lessons for fairness. Eleven students took the mock test on that day. There were five applicants for the Korean language course, four English speakers, and two students who took the challenge. The average score for Korean language test applicants was 68.25 points, and 60.5 points for English. English, which has been converted to absolute evaluation this year, is ranked as fourth with 60 points. College Students Consume for Mock-up College Scholastic Ability Tests-Conference Test (Yonhap news) College students take an Education Reform Project Group Thursday in Seoul. Yang Dong-kyu (23), who spoke Korean, said, "" I couldn't answer the question of whether I had to take the test first because I could get a fingerprint from an unfamiliar field and could fit the grade level of a high school student. "" If the test involves the theory of ` overshooting ` in the long term and the test of digital communication coding, even though the exchange rate and interest rate can be rapidly surpassed in the short term with the Korean fingerprint this year, it is not clear whether the test is true. Several participants were skeptical that the CSAT would be considered the ' oriental medicine, ' which determines their lives. Yang said, The CSAT is just an efficient test, and I wonder if it is right to evaluate university mathematics by asking students to answer a few questions when they have different personalities, Jeong Hae-na (25), who said, "" I received a lot of private education when I was a high school student, "" said, "" I didn't understand what I wrote by using ' techniques ' or ' I read my own problems, ' and added, ' I found my main character as if I was reading a novel. ' After the mock test, honorary professor Park Do-soon and his colleagues, who established the CSAT as the first president of the Korean Curriculum and Evaluation Board, conducted a conversation. "" If I forgot what I studied on the past when I studied on the CSAT again a few years later, I should have studied ' Forget It, ' "" he said. He said, "" It is possible to qualify for the CSAT, and some universities already have very little to include it, "" adding, "" It is the only university units that remain focused on the CSAT that remain. "" `` Education is about taking the ` poor ` and teaching them, '' Park stressed. `` Sequencing the students is about giving up education. '' He showed skepticism, saying, The CSAT, which is originally meant to be an aptitude test but is now used to rank around the country, would be very difficult to determine whether the CSAT, which has been turned into an academic exam based on its original purpose. jylee24@yna.co.kr. Report on the news at news channel ▶ POSCO E&amp;C will shoot Starbucks coffee at 400 next year [Money Tuday Loan Obstaction Report to Advance Loan Determination Plan]As the total debt service ratio (DSR), which measures a bank's ability to repay when it lends, is forecast to hit the housing market, which has become sluggish since the Aug. 2 real estate measure.The real estate market on July 26 showed growing concern over the trade cliff as financial authorities strengthened screening regulations on household debt and speculative demand, leaving even those who want to borrow and buy homes.Financial authorities announced on the same day that they would introduce a new DTI in speculation zones, overheated speculation zones, areas to be adjusted, and the government will introduce the DSR as an advanced screening indicator for banks in the fourth quarter next year. The regulations on lending to households were tightened up to curb lending to households, to force speculative investment in real estate by overloading them, or to fundamentally block any gap investment that would result in an increase in the rent.The market will inevitably see the contraction and adjustment of housing prices amid the sluggish market, such as possible price hikes and the possible rise of the benchmark interest rate next year. According to Seoul Real Estate Information Square, the number of apartments traded in Seoul stood at 5113 as of July 26, which is equivalent to 11,144 apartments last November. After the 8-2 measure, housing prices in Seoul continued to rise with the first three districts (Gangnam, Seocho and Songpa), and buyers who don't lower their sales prices are expected to face a fierce battle for buyers. Some say housing prices in Seoul could fall due to the consolidation of financial regulations. Lee Min-jae, real estate research fellow at NH Investment and Securities, said, "" The price of housing in the first half of the year in Seoul will be highly adjusted due to comprehensive household debt measures, large-scale housing prices starting next year, and interest rate hikes. "" Seoul, whose housing price has not decreased, is not a "" safety zone. "" As the possibility of a decline in housing prices further increases the preference of safety assets, it is also pointed out that the difference between Seoul and Gyeonggi Province is also being raised. An official at a large construction company said, "" People who took out loans and invested in real estate sites around the country were more likely to face tougher regulations and lower prices due to concerns about a decline in sales, making it more likely that they would be able to reduce their prices on the market. "" In particular, in the economic zone, where the volume of land to be transferred to and from the apartment next year is expected to shrink due to tougher regulations. As the volume of apartments in the nation is expected to grow from 370,000 this year to 450,000 next year, the economic circle predicts that housing prices will begin to adjust as the actual time of moving in and enforcing regulations. "" This year, more than 128,000 homes are already in the business sector and there are high supply worries, "" said Lee Hyun-soo, researcher at Real Estate 114 Research Center. "" The risk of over-deployment in the South and some areas is rising. "" It is also a burden to deal with a number of issues, such as the introduction of a multI-family transfer income tax and the application of a reconstruction-excess return system, even after the enforcement of financial regulations. Profit-taking real estate preferences, such as shopping malls, are expected to grow as rental profit and profit margins are expected due to sluggish housing market.What you see next door is a free comic strip and a gift batter! ▶ Cheerleader vs. racing girl Shin Hee-eun is a reporter at gorgon@mt.co.kr< or the ' Real Time News with Money ' ; no put-downs or redistributions are allowed >"
"[Hankyoreh] Taepyeongro mobile phone - former NIS second assistant director choeyunsu ubyeongu I reach director of the closest contact Park Geun-hye, a former deputy head of the government the National Intelligence Service former deputy director chumyeongho, test.… internal affairs at the time of dispatch “The incumbent leader is a serious problem ‘through destruction of evidence’” person familiar … get Supreme Public Prosecutor`s Office prosecution is on trial on August 24, ubyeongu all over.Carried out raids against the senior presidential secretary for civil affairs. Former presidential secretary for civil affairs Woo Byung-woo and former deputy head of the National Intelligence Service Choi Yoon-soo are to face charges of making "" secret reports "" on their cell phones, prosecutors said Thursday. In particular, it is expected to stir up controversy as current prosecution officials served as links between the two. The Supreme Public Prosecutors ` Office has begun inspecting the officials. When the prosecution started an investigation into Choo on charges of "" reporting the details of an illegal surveillance "" to the public, Woo's lawyer and Choi received confirmation via a series of court officials. If it is revealed that they exchanged phone calls before investigating, they could face suspicion that they tried to destroy evidence. The prosecutors ` choice to relay their message appears to have been due to their intimate knowledge of the NIS situation. Have been working in the NIS as I Park Geun-hye is the government. Prosecutors found that the former chief of staff Woo and Choi did not call Choo directly, and that their contact was made only by Woo's lawyer and Choi through the inspection. Their destruction of evidence was no exception during the peak of their investigation into Chu`s testimony last month. Chu, former director of the blacklist Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak administration and execute on July 16 last month summoned again the prosecution for various reasons such as charges of being investigated. Former head of the department Choo called prosecutors during the investigation, and after hanging up the phone, prosecutors called former deputy director Choi Yoon-soo immediately. If Chu`s phone is in trouble, ex-director Kim Dong-woo has taken over as Chu`s lawyer. Prosecutors indicted Choo on charges of political involvement and abuse of authority under the National Intelligence Service law on July 22, specifying Choi and Woo as partners. In particular, the prosecution believes that the phone records of the many calls are checked and that the evidence could be destroyed. Prosecutors raided the car and cell phone of Woo on July 24 and seized the cell phone of Choi at the same time. The prosecution and others believe it is a serious problem that the incumbent prosecution chief acted as a link to the accused's destruction of evidence. Prosecutors confirmed that Chung ChI-ho, a dead NIS official, also spoke with prosecutors on July 30 just before he went to the prosecutors for questioning. It is known that the two calls were made between July 20 and 27 last month only in the form of a few dozen times. Prosecutors said in a telephone conversation with < The Hankyoreh > that they had no particular comment and hung up the phone. Prosecutors recently questioned prosecutors as witnesses. Meanwhile, the prosecution summoned former Deputy Director Choi to investigate the possibility of his involvement in creating the ` blacklist of culture and the art community ` and to contact the former chief of the ministry through questioning and questioning him over the ` secret reporting ` allegation. Prosecutors are also reportedly scheduled to summon Woo. It is the fourth time that Woo has been questioned by prosecutors.

"Lee Young-mi's Gwanghwamun era, Sejong Street in front of Gwanghwamun Plaza, Gwanghwamun Plaza, used to be a symbol of authority and repression during the past military governments. The wide road in the 16 lanes was completely blocked from access by citizens without a crosswalk. Starting with the demolition of the Joseon Government-General's building in 1995, the Gwanghwamun area gradually returned to the public. As a result, the Gwanghwamun area frequently appears as an image of Korea's famous landmarks in dramas and plays. When you look around Gwanghwamun, you can see the scenes of Taebyeon (TVXQ) drama < Dokkaebi (Right & Kim Shin-ri) and Kim Go-eun (Ji Eun-tak) meeting at Gwanghwamun, and see that the intersection of Tibeyeon and Taegwangwang-ro changed a few decades later, The first is the first half of the 1960s when the center was opened and the current U.S. Embassy building was built on the other side. The authoritative and splendid central view of Gyeongbok Palace below Bukhansan Mountain, combined with two totally different buildings, swept away unnecessary decorations, and the modern atmosphere of the palace was full of practical and reasonable straight lines that provided a refreshing look. Rather than the early modern images represented by Western Europe, Hyundai has developed a modern image represented by the United States in Sejong-ro. The second time is the landscape changes of the late Park Chung-hee era, which began with Yi's statue in 1968 and ended with the completion of the concrete building of Gwanghwamun in March and the Sejong Center in 1978. Beyond the image of American modernism and practicality in the early 1960s, the statue was seen as a symbol of nationalism and nationalism amid ten provinces, tile roofs, and armor. And once again in the 2000s, the landscape here has changed dramatically and is still being developed. Kim Ji-ha, who published "" OganshI "" in 1970s, was imprisoned by anti-communist law and closed down Yi Sun-sin's book in 1971, is set to appear on the stage next year. Already, he was preparing to perform in a drama class at Seoul National University's Culture University in the spring of that year, but due to the closing order at Seoul National University in May, the concert was canceled and announced only on page. < Guri Yi Sun-sin, the statue of Yi Sun-sin at the Gwanghwamun intersection, and the sculpture is a simple composition of dialogue with the poor man who passed by. Lee Soon-shin, frustrated with copper, asked the taffies to free himself by taking the motif from Oscar Wilde's Happy Prince. In "" The Happy Prince "", the swallow peels gold and distributes to the poor, while the prince and the swallow go away humble in this world, but ends up happily holding the angel's hand and go to heaven. However, in Guri Yi Sun-sin >, the poet is drunk and asleep, and the poet is arrested for stealing the taffies with the copper helmet and armor that he took off. The helmet and armor are covered up again with Lee Soon-shin, and he is so frustrated that he starts to struggle and says, "" Swallows! Why don't you come? "" This swallow is also the symbol of spring and the expression of the "" Happy Prince "". When the road passed through without a crosswalk on the same road that was 2.2 kilometers from Seoul Station to Gwanghwamun during the military regime, Gwanghwamun Plaza, the statue of Yi Sun-sin, an important landmark of Korea, was recently an important place to mock. TvN criticized Park Chung-hee days delivery of work <Yi Sun-sin copper> General Park Chung-hee's president, love is so very special. It is hard to say whether the shrine, Hyeonchungsa Shrine, is designated as a national treasure by the Sunghwa and Nanjung Diary. By default, with the identity of a soldier and sent youth in the late Japanese occupation generation called ‘literary indulgence to a tattoo of their demise for a shipbuilding’ to share.Perception of history, gung ho in their attitudes, attitudes, and was superimposed on the tragic beauty of death. One more thing to keep in mind is the fact that the diplomatic ties between Korea and Japan, promoted despite the opposition of the intellectuals, have seriously damaged his motto of "" national democracy. "" The idea of keeping Yi Sun-sin, the most fearful figure of Japan, on the street of Sejong-ro, in front of the Central Office suggests that the diplomatic relations between Korea and Japan, which he promoted, was not a "" disgraceful diplomatic gesture. "" The construction of the statue of Yi at that point had to deal a blow to the screening of perverse intellectuals. < Guri Yi Sun-sin > shows this clearly. In front of him, he said, "" One of the tall rascals left a man in a secret house, and the whole nation sang the song of the dead. "" And he said, "" The people of this country are angry. In particular, criticism over the appearance of the statue is rather keen. "" Brave, manly, unable to feel creepy and bony "" asks the question, then, "" Who are you trying to hold down? "" The writer feels that the statue is not being erected as a frontier to Japan but rather shows an oppressive attitude toward the people. Park is in 1971, the third-term constitutional revision are attained through the third president in election year. The Park Chung-hee administration, which was pushed by protests against corruption in elections and training, ended up giving up its right to divide power or choose the basic right of the people with the Yushin in October 1972. In the play, the taffeto director and the patriarch poet rubbed the statue, but the reality was much more rigid. As the era of Seoul Mayor Kim Hyeon-ok opened in 1966, the appearance of Seoul changed drastically, including covering up Cheonggyecheon Stream and constructing an overpass. In 1967, a underpass will be built at Gwanghwamun intersection, Taepyeong-ro, and Gaepung Building next to Seoul City Hall. This makes the 2.2-kilometer road from Seoul Station to Gwanghwamun Gate exclusively for cars with no pedestrian crossing.(See Gwanghwamun Sonata - Return the Clock in 2009 for the Seoul Museum of History (See Dorok) In other words, the statue was inaccessible to people except for traffic police and statue managers. In addition, another structure is set up to alter the landscape of Sejong-ro street in 1971 when < Guri Yi Sun-sin > was announced. It is a huge arch that runs from the Dong-A Ilbo building (the current Ilmin Museum of Art) to the international theater. The arch in the government's campaign slogan, the day of public and the president was celebrate, the statement that overseas tours. A long, drive-only, linear road is visible from the south to the north, through an arch containing the government's propaganda and then through the statue of Yi Sun-sin and the central office's central office's central office. It is nationalism itself from the point of view. The arch was dismantled in 1982. Built in August 2009, Gwanghwamun Plaza, even though it is an island stuck in a driveway, is loved by citizens and has emerged as a place for democracy. Picture is the fifth round of candlelight vigils early on 26 November last year was well over 100 million citizens is Park Geun-hye was the resignation of the president demanding picture, a South Korean press corps ys.Chosun Government-General building, Sejongno Start to dismantling the scenes are once again restored Gwanghwamun Plaza and Gwanghwamun Gate in its present form is great to have turned to 2009-10. It is not without a little change. Kyobo Building stands tall behind the monument at Gwanghwamun intersection in 1981, and the scene here was different once again when Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company (now Hyundai Marine Building) was built on the opposite side of Gwanghwamun intersection in 1984. However, it is hardly a drastic change in the meaning of history. Kyobo Building was a huge ' fake building ' imitating the U.S. Embassy building in Japan in response to strong requests from its client. Though sophisticated, he was not refreshed but was a big influence. It followed with its dry and clunky appearance and little consideration for its context with the surrounding buildings, only creating a scene of large corporate buildings in the modern city of Seoul. Until the 1980s, the scenery of Sejong-ro still shows an obsession that the public should simply push ahead with large and strong views in order to follow developed countries. A former military man president and civilian government took over the end of time until now it is ‘Restore’ that name changes began. Only then can we reflect on the distorted historical facts. The building of the Chosun governor-general was torn down in 1995, and the restoration of Gwanghwamun began in 2006. When the Joseon Gongjeongjeon distorted the angle to face the Japanese shrine of Namsan Mountain, the restored Gwanghwamun was erected to correct the angle of Gwankritjo's Gwanghwamun, which headed toward the Namsan Shrine. A few years earlier, a pedestrian crossing was launched at Gwanghwamun intersection from 2005, and the changes were completed with the restoration of Gwanghwamun in 2010. Gwanghwamun Plaza (completed in 2009) may have filled with the derisive words of ' an island blocked off by the road ' and ' a huge median strip '. However, the center of the street is a significant place for citizens Anyway, the central office, the concrete structure, the statue of Yi Sun-sin, the large arch of the 1970s, and the scene of the cars were completely cleared by this, and the restored landscape of Gyeongbok Palace, the statue of King Sejong, and the statue of Yi Sun-sin stood as a single row. So, in movies and TV dramas since 2000, Sejong-ro has frequently appeared as the rendezvous point of Korean Seoul lovers. The most impressive scene was filmed in Sejong-ro, Seoul, in the movie < My Girlfriend > (Kwak Jae-yong, director). Gwanghwamun intersection is where police officer Kyung-jin (Jun Ji-hyun) meets her late girlfriend Myeong-woo (Jang Hyeok) in her dream after being caught in a roundup. The late lover Myeong-woo leaves Kyung-jin, saying, ' Admit that Myeong-woo is dead, ' and takes bus 77 to go, leaving where silver leaves are scattered. It was the 7th or the 49th day of the Ming Dynasty. No sign of crossing or Gwanghwamun Plaza has yet been made, so it is just lit up around the Ilmin Art Museum and Gwanghwamun Post Office, but it is said that people from different parts of space and time who flew to the current street appeared at the intersection. This is the most important place to show the current state of Korea."
"Because it is central space. After the 2005 crosswalk in Sejongro Square, the theater turned into a tourist attraction, a democratic stage in 2009. As if it were the background of a movie or drama, the movie was shown in Gwanghwamun's scenes, the characters crossed over into the space and time. The most memorable scene in the TV drama was the men's film "" In Hyun Wang-hoon > "" (Tibe-Jeong, Song Jae-Kim, director Kim Byun-soo, and 2012). In the book, which was made at a time when the theme of time travel was about to rise, Kim Bung-do (Ji Hyun-woo), a Hong Kong scholar during King Sukjong's reign of King Sukjong, tries to prevent the assassination of the deposed Queen Inhyeon. After jumping over the fence at Gyeongbok Palace on horseback, it was Gwanghwamun Plaza in 2012. Set in the middle of the bus and car passing by Gwanghwamun in the 21st century, Kim Bung-do meets the best actress of the 21st century, Yoo In-na. Since then, Kim, who has traveled between the past and the present, has a finger touch on the ' Waterwayo History ' section of Gwanghwamun Plaza. It is now possible because the land on Sejong-ro was excavated from the site and Gwanghwamun Gate was restored over several hundred years. It was a TV drama that reflects the meaning of this space. Since then, such settings have often appeared in dramas. It is made by Kim Eun-sook, the hit maker, and Lee Eung-bok, the director of the beautiful screen. Although it was not necessarily Gwanghwamun as in the case of Queen Inhyeon, the most suitable and wonderful place to show that it was not Canada but Korea was also in front of Gwanghwamun. < Chicago typewriter > Jin Soo-wan, director Kim Chul-kyu, and 2017 also when I lost my brother in 1930, I most want to see Yoo Jin-oh (Goh Kyung-pyo), governor of the Joseon Dynasty, who became a ghost writer Three young people who risked their lives to become independent during the 1930s are being reincarnated in the 2010 century and taken photos with Gwanghwamun as their background. Now, this is the most important place to visit in Seoul. Foreign youth who choose to tour Korea on the drama Hallyu will take a photo in the background of Gwanghwamun, borrowing a fancy fusion hanbok, which is likely to appear in the drama at a Hanbok rental store near Sejongno. It was once so oppressive before "" Guri Yi Sun-sin, "" now being the photo's tourist destination with colorful fountains. Be my best friend! [Daily Subscription] AnimalParticles [KakaoTalk] [KA kakao Hankair Shinkamer : The official family of the missing Argentine Navy Seaboard is shown praying for the first time.Family members and friends of the missing sailors attended the ceremony outside the Mardell Plata naval base.As AFP reported, the Navy's spokesman Enrique BalbI said of possible survivors should "" move only on firm evidence. We will focus on finding submarines for now, vague. However, most of the family members have lost hope since authorities announced on July 23 that they heard an explosion inside the submarine. The family claimed that San Juan was very old, but the Navy denied it had undergone any major checks two days before setting sail. As weather conditions eased compared to last week, search continued on July 25 for missing crew members and San Juan. As the Antonov transport plane of Russia's seabed detection robot, which can be searched for up to 1000 meters below the surface of the water, arrived, the search speed was also accelerated. The United States, Britain, Brazil and Chile are also supporting search. German model TR-70000-class Huano lost contact with the South American side while returning to the Mardel-Flatta base about 400 kilometers from its southernmost Ussuaia base. The Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service announced Monday a plan to advance the screening process of banks ` loans based on the company`s concrete formula. This is a characteristic of the comprehensive household debt package, which was introduced on July 24. The new DTI is the annual income distribution of all mortgage principals and interests on all home equity loans, not mortgage loans. The current DTI is divided into annual incomes by adding the principal of new mortgage loans and other lending interests, including existing mortgage loans. As the new DTI recognizes even the principal amount of the existing mortgage loans as the burden of paying the principal and interest per year, the ratio of mortgage loans will increase and the amount of loans will decrease. In fact, the average lending per capita by Kookmin Bank in the first half of this year is forecast to shrink by 311 million won (12.1 percent) to 227 million won, up from 258 million won. When it comes to the annual burden of paying off the principal and interest, the variable is the duration of the loan. Renting the same amount of money, the longer the loan period, the less money one owes each year. As such, the amount of available loans will increase. Assuming that 500 million won is to be borrowed at maturity of 20 years, the full repayment is 25 million (500,000,200 years) in principal payment per year, which is to be carried out on the DTI molecule. The grace period is excluded from the loan period ; with the two years of grace the yearly principal payment amount is 27.8 million won (500,188 years), and the five-year grace period is 33.3 million won (550,500 years). A temporary payment by using the principal amount of a loan to maturity is granted up to 10 years at the longest period of time. Annual principal payments grow to 50 million won (500 million won10year). New loan for intermediate payment and transfer will not apply to the new DTI. However, when taking out a mortgage, the mortgage loan should be divided into 25 years and then calculated as DTI when it is needed. Interest payment reflects the actual amount of the burden. Other loans, such as credit loans, are calculated by adding one percentage point to the Bank of Korea's average household loan rate announced by the Bank of Korea (BOK). Multiple home equity holders can apply for up to 15 years of loans, regardless of the actual loan period, when calculating the DTI from the second home mortgage loan.The new DTI is also slightly different from the current DTI in its analysis of annual income. First, the income for the year is identified, not just the income for the year, but also for the past two years. If the income is significantly variable (± 20 %) from the previous year, the average of the income for the two years is applied. However, if the possibility of the increased income is confirmed, such as promotion, only recent income is reflected. If the latest income is less than one year, 10 % is deducted from converting to yearly income. If it is found that there are unavoidable reasons, such as leave of absence, and the sustainability of the income, the amount should not be deducted. A non-collectible repayment scheme with a maturity of 10 years or more can be borrowed to reflect the expected future increase in income. Age restrictions (under 40) on prospective income reflection have been eliminated. If the income can not be submitted for reasons such as non-work, the recognition income is deducted to 95 % and the reported income to 90 %. The recognized income is the income recognized as the details of payment of national pension or health insurance premium, and reported income is the income estimated to be in the use of interest, dividends, rent, or cards. Without a mortgage on a spouse's home, his or her income is added to her annual income. If one's spouse has a credit loan rather than a mortgage, the interest will be added to the annual principal payment amount. Young people (homeless below the age of 40) and newly married couples (within five years of marriage) adjust their future earnings higher than normal borrowers when acknowledging prospective incomes. If two mortgage loans are secured due to inevitable reasons, such as moving, when the existing home is disposed of immediately, only the interest rate will be reflected on the DTI but excluding the principal amount of existing home mortgage loans. If the government promises to dispose of existing homes within two years and pay off existing mortgage loans, the new loans will not be subject to a maturity limitation. The goal is to establish an advanced credit screening practice based on the ability to repay the debt, said Sohn Byung-doo, head of the Financial Supervisory Commission.Director General of the Financial Services Commission, Sohn Byung-doo, zheng@yna.co.kr"
"People are suffering from smokers who smoke at the entrance to the railway station. Furthermore, as cigarette smoke is introduced into the history of Korea, adults and children are exposed to second-hand smoke, which is why it is necessary to prepare measures.At 10:00 a.m., in front of Seoul Station in Yongsan-gu, Seoul, on July 24, dozens of smokers were gathered here to smoke. Their smoking area is close to the historical entrance, which is less than three meters away. There were signs of non-smoking areas everywhere, but smokers were careless about it.Under these circumstances, the faces of the citizens who passed through the area look uneasy. One mother who came out with her children kept waving her hands and avoiding the smell of cigarettes. In particular, complaints by customers were growing as cigarette smoke reached the historical level every time they opened the door.Kim Jin-ok (42), a housewife who came to Seoul to meet a friend from Busan, said, It is really frustrating to hear that the first impression we have arrived at the station is cigarette smoke, and smokers gather to smoke like this."" I didn't feel very good when I went to the historical entrance with a smell of tobacco on my nose, "" said an old college student, "" at least you should drive your cigarette from a distance from the entrance to the station. ""Although the smoking area was originally closed to the public, the room had been torn down to make it fresh because of lack of ventilation. The Korea Railroad, which is in charge of Seoul Station, started out by posting signs to stop smoking near the gates, but has virtually left it open because of no effects.The situation was similar in the nearby Yongsan subway plaza. Smokers gathered in twos and threes near the ashtrays and garbage bins installed near Yongsan Station plaza and were smoking. Whether some smokers spit on the floor while smoking, the saliva of people was full.However, the Seoul Metropolitan Government and each district say that it is difficult to crack down on them. According to the National Health Promotion Act, non-smoking areas were required to be decided according to local council regulations. However, unlike subway stations, the Seoul Metropolitan Government excluded the smoking ban from the smoking ban.Seoul Station is a multI-use facility, used on average by 400,000 people a day, and serves as a gateway for foreigners who enter Seoul from Incheon Airport. However, the problem continues because the smoking area can not be designated as a non-smoking area and there are no suitable smoking booths.Seoul officials said, It will be rather limited to revising the ordinance since there are not many train stations in the city, adding, The Seoul station is currently setting up smoking booths at Korail, while Yongsan Station will have its own non-smoking section starting next month./ reporter Lee Young-woong hero@inews24.com and subscribe to I news 24 on Naver channel.Meet the real estate manager at I news TV.[[raNews 24 No Jaywalking and Redistribution] The U.S. net neutrality of global ICT enterprises has been successful, and why? "" The Republican Party's Theory of Local Precedentialism, "" said the network industry. FCC Chairman Agit Phi is the U.S. company and the similarities between Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, the world's largest and fifth largest global market capitalization, are ICT businesses. The growth of U.S. ICT businesses that literally dominate the world was the power of the United States.These firms have grown under the principle of ' net neutrality '. Network neutrality is the rule that network operators (telcos) should treat network users equally without discriminating. Prohibition of access blocking, speed control and no prioritization are the keys to network neutrality. If the service provider had blocked or slowed YouTube's access due to excessive traffic, it would not have grown into a global platform. Netflix and Facebook have the same story. The U.S. government is trying to pull out the power of ICT businesses. It is intended to scrap the principle of network neutrality. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released its final draft on Tuesday (local time) to reverse its ' Net neutrality ' policy. After the Obama administration enacted in 2015, the principle of network neutrality will be abolished after two years.Various interpretations are made as to why the U.S. intends to abandon its principle of network neutrality.First, the Trump administration's policy line, the U.S. priority system, is to make the most of the nation's money market. Yang Hee-tae, an analyst at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology, described the FCC's network neutrality decommissioning as a "" strategic choice for the nation "" in a report titled, "" The Trump Administration's Net Neutrality Principle. ""The U.S. priority is aimed at creating jobs and boosting consumption in the United States. It is placing economic stimulus by investing in large-scale infrastructure in the direction of fiscal policy. Service providers, or networks, are typical domestic industries. Digging the ground, laying the wire, and building base stations are only possible on U.S. soil. It is labor-intensive rather than software-based content and platforms."" The FCC's push to abolish network neutrality therefore could be seen as part of its efforts to develop telecom infrastructure projects, create jobs, and, more importantly, secure competitive edge for the next-generation 5G networks, "" said Yang.Indeed, the FCC in April evaluated the Obama administration's network-neutrality policies as failing, and cited _ decreased investment in broadband networks in the U.S. _ and decreased authority of the U.S. Commission on Investment of Broadband-related Data Infrastructure (▲) to support new or upgraded broadband infrastructure deployment.Trump, Obama and other conflicts over network-neutrality principles are interpreted as "" ideological issues "" between U.S. political parties. The difference between Republicans, who traditionally stressed corporate autonomy, and Democrats, who stressed the need for regulation, is at the heart of the controversy over network neutrality, said Kwon Oh-sang, head of the Center for Media Future.The principle of network neutrality of the Democratic Obama administration imposes a duty on telcos. They say that the network is a public service and should not discriminate against users. The Republican Trump administration, on the other hand, regards such a duty as a drag on businesses. Network neutrality hinders the development of the telecommunications industry.The move will stop the federal government from managing the Internet in detail, Pei told The New York Times. Instead, the FCC would ask ISPs (service providers) to be just business transparency. This will allow consumers to buy the best service for themselves. Operators and small companies may also innovate on information, said a spokesman for the Korea Advanced Institute of Technology.Kim Dong-pyo, reporter of the Korea Press letmein@asiae.co.krIt is seen as an aftermath of sanctions against North Korea, which is expected to have a huge impact.A correspondent from Dandong, North Korea, was the sole visitor.◀ Report : North Korea restaurant, Pyongyang office, Aprok river, Dandong, China.Doors locked with a notice saying they are closing for repairs.At night, the luggage from inside the building is carried out continuously.When to resume the business, you will be asked when you are about to withdraw.[North Korean Cafeterian] "" I don't run here again.

"As the iPhone X (10), which was released in Korea on July 24, is starting its first sale in two days, the highest price tag ever recorded was set at 1,420,000 won (based on the standard 64GB). Complaints on internet blogs have been raised that Apple is over-profiting on the 10th anniversary of its iPhone release.The controversy over excessive profits came after IHS Market, a global market research firm, announced that it estimated the manufacturing cost of a 64GB model at $ 370.25 million, calculating the cost of Apple's iPhone X. That is because the cost of the products accounts for only 37 percent of the total cost based on the global unit price (999 dollars).The map analyzed the cost of producing the iPhone X with Korean experts. Local experts also questioned whether IHS Market is generally correct in its analysis, saying, It is fair to say that it is worth $ 300 more than the previous model, which was released for $ 699. Of course, product prices reflect invisible costs, such as cost of product, labor, marketing, research and development. However, the prevailing view was that the iPhone's price was too high. While some Korean experts have used new parts or expensive parts that were not included in other premium smartphones, combined, the cost increase was around $ 40, said an official who looked inside the iPhone X.◇ Product costs are around $ 40 '' higher than the iPhone X-Cost, mainly due to OLED displays, face-aware 3D sensors and bi-based batteries. The iPhone X created a screen covering the entire front panel, leaving only the top half of the screen. IHS Market estimates the price of its high-end display at $ 110. "" It would have cost more to grow the screen and make the shape sticking out on both sides, "" said a Korean expert on the same size panel, adding, "" It would have cost about $ 20 more to form Samsung Display Company. ""The face recognition sensor of the iPhone X was also analyzed to have raised its costs. Parts including an infrared camera that can recognize faces even at night and a 3D sensor that can measure wrinkles were priced at 16.7 dollars. The iPhone X also added two or three battery packs to its price. Other than the screen, battery and face recognition sensors, the rest are not significantly different from the parts in other similar products, Korean experts said. However, he said 47 screws were special. Local experts say, "" The average smartphone is equipped with bumps for perfect coupling with various parts and screws for only 7 to 8. "" Instead, the iPhone X uses the same process. ◇ Higher than cost marketing factor, ’’ the price of smartphones has doubled in the past decade. When the iPhone was first launched in 2007, it cost $ 499 (about 540,000 won) and Samsung Galaxy S1 came out with its first product (about 650,000 won) in 2010.Apple, in particular, has raised consumer discontent by setting the iPhone X to priced at 1.14 million won, about 300,000 won higher than in the U.S. The magazine asked Apple Korea why the iPhone X is so priced at home, but did not answer.Manufacturers explain smartphones have become more sophisticated than smartphones that were 10 years ago. "" The storage capacity of the smartphone industry has grown from just 4GB to 256GB, and the size of the screen has grown from 3.5 inches to 6 inches, "" the smartphone makers said. All of the parts and materials have become high-end, forcing us to make our products more expensive, said an official at Samsung Economic Research Institute. As new technologies, such as cameras with more than 10 million pixels in color and fingerprints, iris and face recognition, are added, the manufacturing process is becoming increasingly difficult.However, some critics say Apple is enjoying a substantial amount of excess profit based on its strong market dominance. Apple's iPhone business reported operating profit of 30 percent last year, three times larger than Samsung's smartphone business."" There has always been a growing criticism that they will "" buy a gutsy sale "", such as "" inconvenient after-service "" policies or shifting advertising expenses to a telecom company, but the iPhone market maintains a 10 % presence.

(Editor) We drink coffee as a habit. We drink coffee like habit. In a meeting with an acquaintance, when I have finished eating or when I need to pay attention, I can't miss coffee. But when you're drinking coffee, we often measure coffee's flavor with a short phrase, "" This coffee tastes good, "" "" That's a good cup of coffee. "" And that's why it tastes good. In fact, we often show an expert opinion on the foods and drinks that we like and enjoy in our daily lives. For example, crispy and tasty kimchi, grilled, cold fish, glossy and savory rice are symbolic of our abundant language. I think these expressions are the overall result of our language and memories that we experience in various lives. When you drink coffee, the main things you feel when you feel are smell and taste. Among them, the sense of smell is so good that it can distinguish between two thousand different kinds of detailed guides. And you can tell what this scent is by its various memories.

But when you drink coffee, it's different. You have to make a loud drink to get the coffee flavor. Slurping. Drink coffee with a slurping sound, or drink it with a whistling sound, like a hot soup. The reason is that you need to breathe coffee with air to fill your mouth with the smell of coffee. It is also why coffee sorters use this method to assess the quality of coffee. Be careful because you may get a pinch if you inhale coffee too much. He3. Locate the Taste (Identify) This method is an important way to discover the features of coffee. If you send the coffee up and down, you can see the overall flavor of the coffee. First, send the coffee to both sides of the tongue. Depending on the type of coffee you drink, you can feel a thrilling acidity. The acidity of coffee depends on the cultivation area, the Roasting Strength, and the processing method of raw tofu. It is clear when it is treated with a ' Washed Process ', which reduces Roasting or cleans raw head with water. The acidity of coffee depends on the way it is grown, the roaster strength, and the processing method of raw head. [Central Photo] If you felt sour, it's time to feel the body. The term body used to tastate coffee or wine means the sense of absence of touch in the mouth. A good example is the difference between drinking water and drinking milk. When you drink water, you can feel the inside of your mouth getting clearer. In this case, the word ' Body is light ' is used. On the other hand, when you drink milk, you feel a little heavy and full of mouth. This is to say that the body is heavy. Same with coffee. Depending on the region of cultivation, the body of the coffee depends on the way it is processed, and we can find this feeling in our mouths. The body is usually heavy for Indonesian coffee and light for Latin American coffee. 4. Describe, the final step in making our coffee life rich. We can try to express coffee by reviving our experiences and memories. Put together the flavors you held before your coffee, and the taste of the non-smoothing aroma and changing over your tongue, in a word you're drinking. We recommend that you express them with specific examples of almonds, peanuts, lemons, apples, jasmine, etc. But there isn't always a good expression. If coffee is extracted incorrectly or uses bad beans, it can be described as rubber, ash, smell of green beans, etc., something that we don't like. Espresso Kang Jeong-hyeon Now I have a cup of steaming, my favorite cup of African Kenyan coffee. Let me put it in a word. "" Before you have coffee, it smells like jasmine, and when you have a cup of coffee, it tastes like strawberry all over your mouth. "" If you're having a cup of coffee, take a sip of it first. And try to describe coffee with your memories. This little act can make your life fun and rich. Finally, let me close with an unforgettable expression from one of my students when I was involved in Espresso training some time ago. "" This coffee feels like walking barefoot on a hot asphalt. "" Coffee, it's not hard.

"▽ Reinforcement of household loans and additional loans by multiple residents = More difficult to make out of loan within the repayment capacity…Stick measures to control the self-additioning ability of new residents and non-household investors by 1.5-fold The Financial Company Credit Review Promotion Plan, announced by the Financial Services Commission on July 26, was announced by the introduction of the new DTI (Gross Loan Obligation Rate), DSR (Gross Redemption Ability to Refinalize), and the advanced mortgage loan facility. First of all, the new DTI has improved the existing DTI calculation method starting next January. Currently, the DTI only reflects the interest payments on existing loans when receiving mortgage loans (each share), but the new DTI sets the limit on the loans by adding to the repayment amount of the principal and interest of existing loans.This makes it practically impossible for multiple home owners to get additional loans.The income of car owners is extended to the latest ' two years ' to identify the probability of proof. In addition, the maximum allowed income (5 % recognition and 10 % income) should be deducted from the maximum allowed limit of reported income, such as pension payment, and credit card use for the unemployed who have no income. For owners of two or more units, the DTI rule reflects the full amount of the total debt payment burden. In case of multI-state households, the second state will limit the maturity of the mortgage loan to 15 years, and increase lending periods to reduce the DTI rule avoidance.If future income increases are anticipated, the proportion of income estimates will be increased. Currently, only those who are homeless under the age of 40 can reflect future income, but the increase in their future income is reflected when they expect to see an increase in their future income if they submit evidence of working income without limitation. To protect innocent residents, the young people and the newly married couple are exempt from the obligation of confirming their income for two years and recognize the maximum increase in the amount of loans they can apply for. If two main rental units are used for a temporary time, such as the relocation demand, they can be disposed of immediately, and if disposed of within two years, they can not apply the limitations on the maturity of the second group.DSR, which calculates the loan ceiling, including the principal and interest of all loans, including the negative account, as well as mortgage loans, will be introduced from banks in the second half of next year. Financial authorities plan to introduce banks as financial companies ' management indicators in the second half of next year after a trial period in which they can operate freely.The income assessment method applied to DSR primarily recognizes objective evidence income, such as substantiality, stability and sustainability, similar to the New DTI income assessment method. Income reports, such as national pension funds and credit card usage can also be used, but they will be subject to penalties such as income deductions. However, if it is difficult to calculate income according to these criteria, the financial institutions are given autonomy. For example, for credit loans without evidence of income, such as loans to good customers, recognition and income should be verified to produce DSR, or classified as a separate high (Go) DSR loan without viewing the income. The government utilizes the new household debt payment amount as a credit management indicator by managing the portfolio of high DSR ratios within a given percentage. The index is based on the fact that the data of DSR are accumulated by pilot operations, and that the data are not presented as formal DSR management criteria during the period required for the analysis of client information of financial institutions.It will be introduced to banks in the second half of next year and non-bank financial institutions such as the second half of the year. The government will set a high DSR standard in the second half of next year, said Lee Hyung-joo, director of the financial policy bureau. "" In the end, the main objective is to match the loan ceiling to the ability of the car to repay. "" Lee said, "" I've looked to the banks for capacity to pay me off, and the long-term limit may differ depending on the banks. ""Starting next March, the government will assess the suitability of real estate rental loans by calculating the ratio of interest payment to loans. The government is set to make loans tougher by offering 1.25 times more housing and 1.5 times less housing. When assessing rental loans for real estate, the RTI calculated based on interest costs relative to annual rental income to assess the appropriateness of such loans. Rental income is calculated based on lease agreements by rental building or business establishment, reliable market data, appraisal report, and peripheral market price. Interest adds interest costs, if an existing loan is available in the rental building, and the stress rate against an increase in interest rates (minimum 1 % p). The Government has set the standard for RTI to use in handling loans for housing that are 1.25 times larger than non-residential. According to the impact analysis conducted by the Financial Services Commission on the introduction of the RTI commissioned by A bank, 21.2 percent of real estate rental loans in 2014-2017 were not enough when it was applied to rental RTI 1.25. In the case of non-residential rental RTI 1.5 times the application, 28.5 percent of non-residential rental loans during the same period were substandard. "" Failure to meet the RTI standard did not mean that loans would not be accepted, "" Lee said, adding, `` To the extent set by financial institutions, the remarks could be separately stated and added in advance. Ineluctable debt taking over less than 100 million won, inheritance and loan out of debt will not be considered for RTI, and if the loan with heavy loans handled after implementation of the guidelines is converted to a debit. In addition, financial institutions should select three or more businesses to manage each year, considering the size of loans and the rate of increase in loans, and set a limit for each sector. For example, Bank A currently manages credit limits by classifying real estate leasing, restaurants and accommodation businesses as individual business loans and corporate loans. "" Banks are voluntarily checking their risk management system for appropriateness, "" he said. "" Actually, financial institutions are offering to reduce their default after the effective mortgage is exceeded, and when it comes to paying off the mortgage, they can repay the loan. "" The government is planning to establish a specific guidelines for screening of banks ' individual business loans in January next year and put them into effect starting March. The results of the bank's introduction will be reviewed later. lovelypsyche@newsis.com>"
"The law enforcement authorities found that the parents who were found to have abused their children's property due to increased protection of their own property, were found guilty of abusing their own wealth by paying bribes. It is the first time that a relative's guardian has been found guilty of indiscriminate use of the adult guardian's property since July 2013. Hyun-mo (53) has been supporting his younger brother (51), his only relative, since 2011. His younger brother, who was single, was unconscious in a car accident and was paralyzed from death. Hyun, who took care of her little brother at odd hours from work, requested that the court open an adult guardian. She needed 140 million won in insurance for her younger brother's car accident. Hyun, who has been appointed guardian of Jeju, bought the Interconfessional villa by combining 120 million won in insurance and 85 million won he borrowed from the bank. However, he and his younger brother completed registration for the transfer in their sole name, not jointly owned. In August 2016, the court found that during guardian supervision, Hyun was advised to return cash to his account or to transfer the shares of the insurance to his brother's name. Even if he bought a house with the good intention of taking good care of his younger brother, he was concerned about the situation in which he could change his mind and dispose of it as he wanted. But Hyun refuses, saying, If I have no cash and I transfer my shares, I will have to pay a lot of tax. Rather, he sued for a repair claim to his guardian, demanding that he pay 240 million won in compensation, saying, I have paid more than my brother`s insurance for the past five years. The court then filed a complaint with the Jeju District Public Prosecutors ` Office against Hyun, who was indicted in February on embezzlement charges. A Jeju criminal court judge who heard the incident said yesterday that he sentenced Hyun to eight months in jail. The amount of the court ruling was 120 million won, and we have not made any recovery despite the court`s continued persuasion of the case, the court explained. The key issue in the nine-month trial was whether the Family Sangdorae Rules would apply to adult guardians. A family-family model is a regulation that exempts relatives from punishment in case of property crimes, such as theft or embezzlement. It is intended to prevent excessive state power involvement to the core of the family. Since the adoption of the protection system, legal circles have debated whether or not the regulation applies to the cheating of guardians. If the clause is applied to guardians, they can not punish their relatives for whatever they want. According to the Seoul Family Court, as of the end of September last year, 84.6 percent of all adult guardians were guardians. The court did not consider the family-oriented family example to apply to guardians. The guardian's job itself is public and therefore does not apply this provision to avoid criminal penalties for property matters among close relatives. After being appointed as an adult guardian, the court should state that even though they are related, they are legally entitled to public roles in managing the protection of the relationship`s property and personal information in accordance with the principle of good faith. The court sentenced him to jail time, but it did not detain Hyun in court as unusual. The decision was made taking into consideration the special circumstances that would make it more difficult to support the accused should Hyun be confined under the circumstances of his only relative. We believe that Hyun is taking good care of his brother, which must have caused a great deal of trouble for the prosecution and the court, as they both recognized him. Although the embezzlement is obvious, a breach of protection occurs against her younger brother, who is a ward of the country, should she be arrested. The court's delay of one sentence and the wait for the restoration of the damage was also a testament to its great agony. Hey`s younger brother is too much of a prison sentence to take care of. We are suffering from the expense of transferring the shares to the younger brother`s name, said lawyer Huh Sang-soo, who is acting on Hyun`s behalf, explaining that Hyun`s plan to recover from any kind of charge. "" If my brother was sent to a nursing home or left unattended, I have nothing to say, but it is too much to say when I was sentenced to jail under my own careful care, "" he said. As the use of the guardian system increases, more cases of the guardian's pet peeve are expected. The number of guardians (the accumulated number of cases under supervision) jumped to 9198 from 1595 at the end of 2014. It is said that there are many cases in which the defendants ' irregularities were detected during the supervision of the courts, even if they were not prosecuted. That is the case of the recently discovered "" P, "" 80, at the Seoul Family Court. After her son's death, P became the guardian of her grandson. As he was covetous by the inheritance of his son of 190 million won, he borrowed the money his son did not borrow, and made it his own internal wife (75) who borrowed it. Based on the results, the grandson embezzled 80 million won from the inheritance. After finding suspicious circumstances, the family inspector reported it to the court, and the role of guardian of P was suspended. The court will soon hold an interrogation session to advise people to restore stolen property to its original condition. Usually, I don`t think it is okay to use it when I work so hard, said an official at the Seoul Family Court. However, if all is punished, there is a "" breach of protection "" problem. They do not have many relatives to support, and even if a third party guardian is granted, he or she will not be able to do so as a family member. Therefore, current law enforcement agencies are advised not to file criminal charges if they find any irregularities, and promise to pay back their debts and prevent recurrences. Of course, if they stick to the end or steal their assets maliciously, they should go to criminal punishment. The system allows the court to appoint appropriate guardians and take care of them due to dementia or mental illness. The guardian is called the "" modern butler "" as he oversees the court and takes on not only financial services and legal judgment, but also personal protection roles, which are difficult for the accused.

""" Be courteous, "" suggested by Rider Alba, Ormay News reporter, O’MaI News, even picks up her personal daily living as news. Your personal experience will give you a more graphic and detailed view of the news. When your story comes to Omai news, it becomes news. Tell me your story.When I woke up in the morning, my back was warm, but when I woke up, it was the season of sirin. Instead of removing the sheets of cotton wool from your head, your hands go first to your bedside cell. In this room, where you are talking to yourself and don't want to go to the bathroom, let alone Bob, the only delivery app is the one that is like the savior. A rooftop house or a house on a hill is much more desperate. At the same time, the riders at the store are busy ordering the constant shipping. There are things we can do for delivery workers who rub their hands together and deliver food warmly through the biting cold winds of the cheeks. That is to observe delivery etiquette. ▲ Saralphan Noodle Day is more dangerous the next day than the snowy day. It is hard to even stop a motorcycle on such an icy road. If you deliver in winter, please wait a while. I remembered shouting, "" Let's play friends, "" as a child. At that time, I was really excited to have fun, and I couldn't help but feel nervous when a rider has to deliver a hamburger before it gets cold. No matter how much I called him, he gave no answer, and he was naturally nervous. Take off the gloves and call the store with shaky hands to ask for the guest's number. Because personal information does not automatically print the number on the order sheet. As I have to memorize it temporarily, I hang up without even saying "" Thank you "" to the number. If you say anything else, you forget your number and your image could be cured with a "" goldfish. "" At that moment, the owner of the order accidentally ran out of laundry and found me. Be a savior. Take a deep breath and open the inside door and call your brother. "" Did you order McDonald's? Come out quickly. "" The client was playing hard with earphones in his ears. Going to Summoner's Valley will be much more fun than welcoming the McDonald's Riders, don't forget that humans are shaking outside. Some people even go out on a delivery or take a shower, but I ask you to place a reservation. If the delivery is delayed due to waiting for one customer, the other also receives the food late. Especially in these winter, the motorcycle shakes due to strong winds and fails to speed up due to the icy roads the day after. Of course, it is the rider's responsibility to get the complaint.    2. If the intercom fails, write down your contact _ ▲ one jotter of notes keep the delivery workers warm. These days, Park Jung-hun often has a lock at the entrance to the studio or villa. I don't know what the landlord thinks, but there are often times when locks are out, or internets are out of order. The deep anger you feel when you are in a rush to arrive and are faced with a situation where you don't have an intercom and you have to dial a password will not be easily felt without trying delivery. Wouldn't the customer have given any thought to what kind of a situation he would be in? It is tolerable until autumn, but in this cold weather, you should heat yourself up with a fire. So sometimes I shout or blow my horn with my motorcycle. Vent one's spleen Some may doubt that I have anger management problems, but I can't help it if the client I once told you again. Of course, take out your phone number again, one at a time, and get your number from the store. On snowy days, hands are freezing and cell phones are really ' should go on with this job, ' and even ' there is no hope ' for people in this country. However, some people say, "" Since the intercom is broken, I want you to call me or write down a memo saying, ' I will come down because it is too high to the fifth floor, ' and it might make my mind melt. Please don't forget this brief memo.    3. The addresses are often delivered exactly by looking at ▲ and the meaningless stock exchange, and often by covering the new address. Park Jung Hoon is really hard to understand, but there are some people who do not know their home address. They wrote addresses roughly because their home wasn't up well on the Internet search, or they made small mistakes in writing down "" World Cup Road No. 30 "" as "" World Cup Path 33. "" In some cases, they do not write their addresses down, but they do. It seems like he is going to come (?) by. The number of riders because of minor mistakes km, address, and may need to move the fifth floor of all is the wrong place, a rooftop house, swearing to come together. coarse sumgwaForced. Listen to the sound that says, "" I didn't order it when I reached the fifth floor. "" These days, he put his home address in blue on the building. You need only check this once.Of course, it may be difficult to find one's own address in the case of a commercial building with many small shopping malls separated sometimes for aesthetic reasons or without signboards, such as Hongikro 3-gil Another quick memo is all it takes. Give me a call. Then write down your contact information in advance. I was once wandering around for a customer who couldn't find his home address, so I finally got hold of him and asked him to write it down properly. Maybe I felt bad, I threw the card with a cynical smile, ' Yes, yes, I do. ' Another customer mumbled, "" Other riders were very welcome. "" Well, it may be because of the way they talk, but a messenger is not the kind of person to give food to customers and be insulted.  4. You shouldn't give cash on credit. The opposite is possible. If you say you will pay in cash, we ask you, would you make 50,000 won without fail? Because I need to keep my change exactly. Of course, I don't have any change if I pay by credit card. I went to pay by credit card, and I handed him 50,000 won and I said, "" I didn't bring your change. "" And he said, "" If you don't think so, I shouldn't mind. "" You don't need the change, and you want the rest as a tip. Maybe you were embarrassed because you ordered them to pay without thinking about how to pay. I don't want to take that tip. Foreigners often tip because they have tip culture, but never give with such anger. If you haven't got your change, you'll have to stop by the store to pick up your change. I have been to the store to return my 300 won change. That does not mean that the money is small. We can be happy with each other if we just check it once before placing an order. If it wasn't for the pity of the people, but for the sake of courtesy, a line of warm notes would have been needed, then we would have to hang around outside. It is advisable to collect the receipt to remove the information on the order. We do not blame only Park Jung-hoon's customers. If you earn more, and if you are guaranteed more hourly base pay, not per unit allowance, you may be willing to spend some time with customers. However, the amount of money they earn is slightly higher than the minimum wage. The five-day workweek is about 1.5 million won.Companies that do this work at low wages are more likely to resent and resent their customers right away. I understand. When I get off work, I don't want to do anything, and I want to have something delivered. However, they do not order on very cold days or when it snows or rains. Riders may also be a better career, if they don't forget that the delivery food we eat was made by someone else's time and effort. We can create decent jobs. Of course, if fair compensation is made for it, you can meet a nicer rider. This is not to say that the rider is sorry for what he says. It is not only the poor and the losers in life who work part-time. There are many reasons, such as because of free time, because they do not want to be tied down by businesses. The idea that delivery workers are socially inferior is a bias. It is the right of a natural worker as well as the right of a consumer to respect and care what is due man to man.

It is not available online game for teens such as ' Player Not available, Battle Ground ' (Battle Ground Down). Because adults generally have different concepts, as set out in game laws that define possible adults such as drinking and smoking, it is difficult to punish them for being ' illegal, ' or ' illegal. ' Critics say the ironic reality must be corrected. The popular online PC game "" Battle Ground "" is inundated with high school seniors who have completed their CSAT. Created by domestic game developer Blue Hole, Battle Ground is a worldwide success not only in Korea, but also in North America and Europe. Jangbyeonggyu Chairman of the Board the blue hole first fourth round of the Industrial Revolution of his Moon Jae-in government Commission and Enterprise Value is the blue hole shot up about five trillion won. Battleground is a first-person shooter (FPS) game, in which gamers compete to survive as a last man by using weapons and vehicles on an isolated island. However, he received a rating from the Game Management Commission for being violent. Under the Game Industry Promotion Act, teenagers are required to attend high schools. High school seniors who were born in 1999 can not play a battle ground under the current law until graduation next year. However, the Youth Protection Act, which regulates the age limit for drinking and smoking, regards children as adults from January 1 of the year when they turn 19. Therefore, high school seniors who become adults next year are still considered teenagers by playing games for more than a month until graduation in February. In reality, the Game Industry Act is not unique. High school seniors are still enjoying battle ground in PC rooms. Adult authentication is needed to create game accounts, but it can be solved easily by borrowing the names of parents, older siblings and others.Kim Ki-bak (18, alias), who started to fight in PC rooms the day after the CSAT, said, "" I haven't been preparing for the exam yet. "" "" If I'm done with essay tests, I'll be in the room with my friends.Even if they catch teenagers playing battleground in PC rooms, it is hard to find cases of punishment. The police official said, ""There is a gray area in the game industry to punish to the law."", saying, ""We received a report was called to attention even if only a degree""Of course, the Game Industry Act regulates the observance of game products-related businesses. It says that businesses should stop teenagers from using games that are not available to teenagers. In the event of a breach, the punishment is the business owner's responsibility. The first time the drug is caught, it will be warned, the second will be suspended five days, the third will be suspended 10 days, and the second will be suspended one month. It is similar to punishing owners of small businesses where teenagers buy alcohol or cigarettes at convenience stores. However, the employer's efforts to fulfill his/her own duty of duty of care and supervision shall be exempted. If there are signs of the efforts by the business owners, such as the warning sign, "" Teens Are not allowed to Battle Ground, "" police said. Police are required to notify the district or game management committee of administrative actions if they detect any violation of the Game Industry Act.Even PC room owners are in a quandary. Lee (34), who runs a PC room in Nowon-gu, Seoul, said, How can adult high school seniors prevent such a fight to PC game rooms late at night when they are not allowed to drink or smoke?Experts suggest that the law should compensate for its shortcomings. We doubt whether the management would strictly apply the law, as high school students graduating only in February are actually reserved for ceremony at graduation, said Sohn Kyo-myung, a lawyer at law firm Weenus.We need to apply the method flexibly to our society, which is so rigid that it is almost two months apart, whether it is adults or not, "" said Wie Jeong-hyeon, vice president of the Korea Game Association.What you see next door is a free comic strip and a gift batter! ▶ Cheerleader vs. racing girl Bang Yoon-young byy@mt.co.kr, Author Kang Joo-hun's zoo@mt.co.kr< Moneytooday in real time news with money, no piracy and redistribution >"
"[Graphic] Balliagung Volcano (Seoul=Union News), a reporter who spouts clouds of smoke, is the highest peak of the Indonesian island of Balley`s Mount Agung (Jakarta = Yonhap News) on July 26. Korean United News Agency correspondent Hwang Chul-hwan (Combined News Agency), 1917.11.26 [Jakarta = Combined News)] (Yonhap News Agency) : As the highest peak volcano in Bali Island, Indonesia, Asung, was once again hit four days, international flights were canceled. Local media and foreign news agencies reported on July 26 that the Agung volcano erupted at 5:30 p.m. local time the day before, releasing ash up to 1,500 meters above the crater. The eruption lasted for more than a few hours, and residents evacuated nearby villages by placing a small amount of ash. However, disaster authorities in Indonesia said, "" There are no signs of a large-scale eruption at the moment, "" adding, "" We will keep the alert level of Agung volcano at the current level. "" We don`t see any increase in earthquakes or volcanic activity, said Sutopo Purwanugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian national disaster agency. The Agung volcano emitted volcanic ash and steam up to 700 meters on July 21, but authorities can not diagnose a huge eruption as a result of the collision between underground water and lava layers. The Indonesian transportation ministry said, "" Even in successive volcanic eruptions, the air route of Bali Island is operating normally. ""People in Bali, Indonesia, are concerned about the black smoke of the volcano. JAMES 2017.11.26 [AFP = But some airlines, including Jelstar, Qantas and Air Asia, have cancelled or delayed their own flights to and from Bali's Eunguralay International Airport. As of July 25, eight international flights to Bali and 13 international flights from Bali were canceled, Sutopo said. About 2,000 passengers are expected to be stranded at the airport as a result, he said. The 3,204-meter-high volcano Agung erupted in a massive eruption in 1963, killing 1,100 people and wounding hundreds nearby. Indonesian disaster authorities raised the alert to a high level on Sept. 22 and evacuated nearby residents after the volcano Agung, which had been suspended for more than 50 years, again showed signs of becoming violent. After the volcanic activity had subsided, authorities lowered the alert level to "" severe, "" but more than 20,000 to 30,000 people were reported to have stayed in shelters before returning home. hwangch@yna.co.kr Egyptian prosecutors announced on July 25 that the death toll of terrorism at the Alada Mosque in northern Sinai has increased to 305. Among them, 27 are children. The number of injured was identified as 128. The terrorist was holding a black flag from the Sunni armed group, the Islamic State (IS). The number of armed personnel present at the site is 25-30. [Graphic] Egypt's Shocker-Al-Al-Al-Albaydh mosque, which was suddenly injured as a base of the Egyptian "" powder keg "" …, is on the ground where Israeli emergency workers and their bodies are being held. According to the announcement by Egyptian authorities at ymarshal@yna.co.kr they appeared at temples where prayer meetings were held and carried out a systematic massacre. They arrived at the mosque in separate vehicles, bombing and firing at the defenseless. Some were uniformed and masked. Members of organizations armed with automatic rifles settled in the main gate of the temple and in 12 windows to attack the churchgoers, according to a prosecution statement. Even after the attack, they blocked roads and fled in perfect order, showing bold and organized behavior. The Sinai Peninsula is an area frequently attacked by extremist groups such as IS. In particular, the IS Sinai Peninsula chapter has repeatedly carried out a series of major attacks aimed at Egyptian police, soldiers, and soldiers, and soldiers. However, a large-scale attack on the employees is unusual. The mosque is known to have visited not only Sunnis but also Muslim mysterious Muslims. The bark is considered heresy in conservative Sunnis and extremists. The bark holy sites and temples in the Middle East and Southeast Asia have repeatedly been threatened and attacked by extremist organizations. tree@yna.co.kr and news reports (click!) ▶ In fact, the government has decided to reduce the number of young reporters who purchase coffee to cover the real estate market in Seoul. The government will reduce the number of multiple home mortgage loans and expand the size of loans for homeless people. As a follow-up measure to the "" Comprehensive Plan for Household Liabilities for Korea's Household Debts "" on October 26, the financial authorities announced plans to upgrade the credit rating of financial institutions by introducing the new DTI (New Debt-Common Rate) and the total debt principal payment ratio (DSR).In particular, the new DTI, which goes into effect in January next year, is set to create several households to reduce the lending ceiling of multiple home owners, which encourages high household debt and rising housing prices. The actual demand for the car, which is expected to see an increase in future income, is designed to raise its loan ceiling. DTI is the ratio of the principal and interest payments (debt) to the annual income only when receiving loans from the Seoul Metropolitan area, speculative areas, overheated speculation zones and re-adjusted regions (50 percent). The multI-family speculative zone has limited DTI's to 30 percent.Existing DTI's are included in the debt that multiple homeowners already receive at the same time as interest payments. The new DTI is and reflects all the state loans to repay the principal and interest. As a result, owners of two or more units will have to pay off their principals and expenses, and therefore, the limit on loans will be eased. Existing borrowers will reduce their loans to 15 years when calculating DTI ratio. The regulation is in line with the government`s real estate policy. The ministry earlier announced various regulations to regulate multiple residents ` speculation, while expanding overheated speculation zones through the Aug. 2 real estate policies. Policies to encourage multiple home owners to sell their homes by raising property taxes, and prevent speculative demand that is excessive in the market The loan regulations, set for next year, are meant to improve the ownership structure of multiple homes by increasing the financial burden of multiple home borrowers. Meanwhile, the plan is designed to make it easier for the government to lend money to young people who are eligible for housing support and those who are more likely to receive future income, such as newlyweds. In reality, the owner who submitted a proof of working income for two years can raise the loan ceiling by applying an increase in future income. For example, workers who are homeless and newly married couples under the age of 40 can get an increase in their future income if they can prove their income within five years. In addition, the ministry's policy to provide extra money for the sale by youths and newlyweds and increase housing supply will give the nation's homeless residents more time to buy homes. "" Adding measures, such as the residential welfare roadmap that comes out later this month, will only make the choice of multiple home residents even smaller, "" a government official said, while expanding lending to youths and the stable conditions for homeless people was made. Ham Young-jin, director of Real Estate 114 Research Center, also said, It will be hard for us to make investments to earn profit from the loans in the future. However, Park Won-kab, a senior adviser at Kookmin Bank`s WM Star Advisory Board, pointed out, Government regulations can make it difficult for retired people, the elderly, and the self-employed to borrow.H01 @.Check CSAT Questions and Answers for 2018 ' News and Photo View on 2018 '"
"< Anchor > Child abuse incident again by nursery school teacher. A nursery school teacher in Incheon put a two-year-old girl on a CCTV and took away rice.This is a report by journalist Park Chan Geun.Incheon Youngjong-do is a children's home.The nursery teacher removes the prizes, and then kick the young child sitting on the floor, wiping the floor.She covers her face with her hands, lies down and can't budge an inch.During the lunch hour, they take away the child's food and give it to others.Dealt parents suspected abuse when their child showed extreme anxiety and obsession with food, and were only able to check the CCTV footage after reporting it to the police.[Dad-child father : It's been a long time since the abuse had been in existence for three months, six months, one year, and we're constantly in suspense.] The nursery teacher insisted that she never abused a child after the report was made.[Child care teacher (call to other parents) : No, no. Not at all. How can I? I raised a child, and I sent a nursery, too.] Police booked the child 32 times in September and October alone, accusing her of abusing him.The head of the children's home, 48, and a 46-year-old mother, who ran a nursery, were also booked on charges of neglecting supervision. The system, set up in 2000, marks its seventeenth year this year, but is still a distant and untrappable institution for the average citizen who is at the edge of a precipice. The recent series of unfortunate cases of murder due to hardships caused by the hardships of living in a small family are leading us to assess the current state of the emergency welfare system on two levels."" The most [provided by Gwangju North Police Station] "" Park Cheol-hong : Recently, the emergency welfare recipients were either caught with enough money or the theft of money by men. Only after the crimes were the two men told desperate stories to make them feel sad. They were given emergency welfare assistance but were later criticized as being the "" medicine after death. "" Citizens even criticized authorities, "" I hate the sin, but what have the government and local governments done? "" A, 39, who was in his thirties when his wife suffered a panic attack and a six-year-old daughter was caught on Oct. 25, using a blunt instrument. As the debts of the former three million won increased to five million won, even home appliances were confiscated. When the court's supervisor and the debtor decided to rush home the stolen home appliances at an auction, Mr. A made the wrong choice. In a police investigation, he was reportedly faced with the challenge of leaving his 160,000-won rental house, to make matters worse, when he could not find a decent job after losing his job. A frustrated man grabbed a blunt instrument and went to the store several times when working as a delivery man to find a way to live by taking 1.1 million won from him. Having no money to go to the scene of the robbery, he walked five kilometers without stopping. Around the road where he walked was a district office in charge of emergency welfare support. If he went to the public service center of the district instead of the place of crime, he could receive support for winter heating expenses and housing within 3-4 days, being selected as the subject of emergency welfare support. Having learned the story of the deceased from a media report late, local governments selected his wife as the subject of welfare assistance by questioning her and gave her 728,800 won in support of the livelihood and 94,900 won in fuel costs. His wife and daughter could receive similar support for up to six months.A 43-year-old taxi driver stole a bag worth one million won ($ 1.3 million) that he left behind on July 3. She was the single mother of a 78-year-old man suffering from a rare disease called Cushing syndrome. Since he had suffered from economic difficulties, he lost control and touched what customers should not want. He was booked on a charge of theft immediately. Upon hearing that her son had been booked for theft, Nomo handed over his entire estate, the 14k gold bracelet. It was a mournful mortifying to compensate for the damage. As the story of B was told, the police station was inundated with phone calls from citizens saying, "" tears never stop, "" "" What are local governments doing without helping these people, and "" I want to pay them a monthly wage? "" The local health advisor for Mr. B called the incident manager and said, "" I think I've been trying to get the most out of the emergency welfare system to help people like Mr. B, but I haven't heard anything yet "" One police officer said, "" Most offenders who have recently been sentenced to living lives have not been made eligible for immediate welfare benefits.

"Former Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin and former Defense Ministry Policy Director Lim Kwan-bin, who were arrested on charges of ordering political comments from the South Korean cyber headquarters, were released yesterday. Unfortunately, the same judge decided to release an individual judge, and the court stepped in and put a stop to the prosecutors ' investigation of comments on cyber history. Whatever the case may be, it is unlikely that the prosecutors ' investigation of the comment on cyber history will be easy.● Two perspectives on V display, or ' indication vs. mere look, ' are considered to have been directed directly by former minister Kim Kwan-jin. Kim left V-shaped checks or signatures on some documents that were reported by the military Cyber Command. Based on this, the prosecution judged that former minister Kim Kwan-jin not only knew enough about the comment, but also gave direct instructions. Kim, however, denies. Kim said, "" The documents related to the process of answering the comments were just one of the countless documents that were uploaded to the minister, and the V mark was a mere sign of seeing, not an order. "" Therefore, he insists that he did not know all about the comment.However, contrary to this argument by the former minister who received the report, the cyber history psychological unit did not seem to think so. Among the documents that the Cyber History psychological warfare group reported to Kim every day, the results of its operation against the South Korean Cyber psychological warfare were : A report analyzes how favorable public opinion has become to the government after conducting an online comment processing, and is one of the documents that says Kim just "" made a simple "" V mark. The reporters obtained one of the documents.● Received the document that was reported to former minister Kim Kwan-jin,The report, written one day before the 2012 presidential election, reveals the circumstances of adding a pro-North Korean image to the face of the opposition lawmakers. At that time, the National Assembly was in the middle of a "" pro-North Korea controversy. "" Some opposition lawmakers called themselves pro-North Korean and urged them to block access to the materials. Some media supported the ' pro-North Korea argument, ' while others criticized the National Assembly for encouraging the color theory.The documents obtained by SBS are reports of how cyber companies responded to the pro-North Korea controversy. The group supported articles urging lawmakers with a blocked access to certain materials, while assigning "" pro-North Korea members "" to directly refer to their own opinions. The results of the work were also analyzed, with public opinion in favor of the so-called allocation of "" pro-North Korea members "" greatly decreasing from 30 percent to 2 percent, and opinion polls say that it is only 70 percent against what is called a "" pro-North Korea lawmaker. "" To put it bluntly, the pro-North Korea controversy has succeeded. It is only a matter of opinion that the military intervened in politics, well outside the scope of the usual psychological warfare against North Korea that Kim claims. The report was also reported to former Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin.● There is something special about the cyber comment report, of course, as former minister Kim said, that is one of the many documents reported that day. However, the document was a special report that was different from many other documents. The cyber headquarters psychological unit held daily online opinion contests and made reports. It contains what was the target of the operation, what was the target of the comments, and what percentage of favorable public opinion and what percentage of unfavorable public opinion was. These reports were put into special bags and put back into special bags after obtaining approval from the head of the Cyber History psychological warfare team early every morning. It was a specially made black leather bag with a lock. It was called a "" black book. "" The leather bags were delivered by licensed agents directly to the secretary's office before the minister went to work every morning. She kept a detailed record of who received it and checked daily whether the minister had read the document. When the minister said he had finished reading the document, he went back to the secretary's office and collected the document in a black book. Then, the head of psychological warfare team visited the document, which was recalled from the secretary's office, and the minister made a decision.Kim Ki-hyun, director of psychological operations at the cyber headquarters, said, "" I knew that I was speaking for Lee Tae-ha, the chief of psychological warfare, when I took a long vacation or something. Kim Ki-hyun said, "" Former Minister Kim Kwan-jin made only a V sign at the time, and sometimes wrote short instructions. "" So, the V sign, which Kim insists is a mere sign, was accepted by the cyber crew who were conducting the actual comment processing at the time as an instruction to keep operating. Kim Ki-hyun says prosecutors should take a more active look at these areas. The prosecutors are investigating those who were involved in the investigation, but the military is investigating those who were involved in the comment processing because they were still soldiers. However, some point out that Lee's investigation is not yet complete. Critics say it is a lukewarm response, as the agency has already reached an unacceptable conclusion that "" manipulation of comments is an individual deviation. "" This is why we are concerned that it might have been just another individual deviation from the previous administration, watching the release of Kim Kwan-jin and Lim Kwan-bin, former minister of policy planning.

"A view of a tower outside Kumamoto Castle in Japan's Kumamoto Prefecture on August 26. It remains open to the public as a result of an earthquake, with the air mass collapsing.On April 16 last year, a powerful earthquake measuring 7.3 hit Kyushu Kumamoto Island, southwestern Japan. 247 people were killed in the earthquake, about 2700 were injured, and more than 180,000 were displaced. At that time, the Japanese government immediately began an on-site study to prevent earthquakes, while taking refugees to safety.■ Two nights before the earthquake's opening, on April 14, 2006, at 9:20 p.m., 6.2 advanced on the Kumamoto mashikI boat. GSJ, the Geological Survey Center of the Japan Institute of Industrial Technology (AIST), identified that the epicenter of the investigation is close to Futagawa Fault and Hinagu, the active fault tree of Kumamoto Prefecture, through its database. The team arrived on April 15, the next day near Kumamoto Prefecture. And at 1:25 a.m. on July 16, the main camp hit Kumamoto Prefecture. An emergency team arrived at 10 a.m. the same day, near the epicenter of the quake, MashikI Pavilion, and evacuated to a safe location after an eight-hour on-site investigation. The emergency team's activities continued until the following day. And around 1:00 a.m. on April 18, 48 hours after the main event took place, GSJ field team released its emergency report on the Internet. An open report showed that the locations of the areas that were known to have been affected by the quake and active fault lines, known as the previous active fault investigation, are nearly identical. It was enough to alert residents in the region near the active section.When the earthquake hit in September last year race Park Geun-hye, the government weather continues the damage an earthquake through. However, it is questionable whether the Korean government sent scholars to study the causes of the earthquake. However, at the recommendation of several geologists, the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy (MOE) made an emergency budget and took an aerial photograph that could serve as the basis for an active fault investigation. Currently, this data is being used for nationally active fault-story research projects.The nation's earthquake prevention project began in April of this year, seven months after the Gyeongju earthquake. The institute was not selected until July this year to study the most relevant active fault in the earthquake. Along with the map of live fault lines, the national earthquake risk map project could not be selected by a research institution and the budget of this year was moved to next year`s budget of 1 billion won.According to the Ministry of Public Administration and Security, the main body of the current earthquake prevention project, the delay in the research was due to the time needed to coordinate opinions among ministries. In case of active fault research, four joint investigation projects were decided by the Ministry of Public Administration and Security, the Geological Resources Research, the Nuclear Safety Commission and the Meteorological Administration, and the ministry's decision to finalize its review was this May.An official familiar with the research project's implementation at the time pointed out that the measures taken by each ministry were inconsistent. When asked to come up with measures after the Gyeongju earthquake, each ministry presented measures with measures that are heated to the core. Some ministries even started their own businesses, making it difficult to meet ministry officials. The ministry has different thoughts and important studies have shown that the budget has been reduced and opinions were not settled until May. The official added, It is not clear that the government intentionally delayed the study, but it was a little too late for us.Earthquake experts say that public interest in the earthquake dropped significantly before the Pohang earthquake. On September 7, the Ministry of Public Administration and Security held an international seminar at the Hilton Hotel in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, on the first anniversary of the earthquake. It was attended by Korean and overseas earthquake experts who participated in the National Earthquake Prevention and Research Service. The media began to report on the Gyeongju scene for the first year of the earthquake, and reports of an international seminar were made there.The atmosphere at the actual seminar caused me to feel less interested in the race, said an expert who attended the seminar. "" There were a lot of meaningful stories about the future plans for disaster prevention, and little that Korean experts could think of, "" the seminar said.■ South Korea is striving to restore its housing, but it will not lose interest in the earthquake even though it is more than a year and a half old. Japan's Daily Daily Daily Newspaper (Kumamoto Kumamoto Prefecture) announced on November 17 that it designated as the ` HayashI Yoshimato ` as its national daily newspaper, and that the Japanese Education Ministry designated it as ` Kumamoto ` This place was designated as a cultural asset by its current status.It is not the first time that Japan has designated an active fault as a natural monument since the earthquake hit. Already, Japan keeps 26 active fault lines as natural monuments. Typically, part of Nojima Fault, the epicenter of the Kobe earthquake that killed 6,000 people in January 1995, was designated as a national monument in 1998. In the case of Nojima Fault, the Japanese government installed an exhibition hall around the fault so that visitors could see the fault when it was left over right. You can also go down to the ground and look at the base of the fault. Japan`s Culture Heritage Online describes Nojima Fault as being stored and preserved as a natural monument to understanding earthquake phenomena and fault-to-fault activities as Korea`s representative natural phenomenon.Cultural Heritage, which has been restored since the earthquake, is also making its restoration public and making efforts to keep itself vigilant against earthquakes. The reporter visited Kumamoto Castle in August, but was unable to enter the castle in the aftermath of the earthquake. However, the collapsing towers outside the castle were set up at the management office to let visitors take pictures. Near the castle, posters urging people not to forget about the Kumamoto earthquake were easy to see. It is no shame that the castle was destroyed by an earthquake, said chief Kimura, who runs the construction company in Kumamoto Prefecture. Rather, it is a lesson not to forget the earthquake, said a professor at a large city who often forgets earthquake lessons because Japan is a country full of natural disasters. We should continue to make efforts not to forget the effects of the earthquake, even if we want to make the country safer.Meanwhile, Korean earthquake specialist Ahn said, Korean measures to deal with the earthquake are only about restoration, but do not seem very interested in remembering and preserving. "" You can't designate a one-story building exposed to the ground as a natural monument like Japan, but you can preserve the houses that were destroyed by an earthquake and use it as an education to alert future generations to the dangers of earthquakes. During the Gyeongju earthquake, I told the government to keep even one house that was destroyed by an earthquake and that was not a good idea to do so. "" "" It would help to explain earthquakes 10 times in person. We need to change our ideas.< White Paper gija [Twitter] Facebook] ▶ [Popular free comic strips] The trend paper (www.khan.co.kr), has shown an upward trend in the total payment of housing prices in Seoul following the anti-replication and redistribution ban on real estate next year. People who have already taken out a mortgage are likely to find it harder to get additional loans, while people who need homeless people will have higher loan limits. This is a report by reporter Lee Yoon-hee. This is a typical reconstruction apartment in Gangnam, Seoul. The price limit for the used area of 83 ㎡, which stood at the end of July, has recently reached 1.8 billion won. It is 150 million won more than before the real estate policy. Apartment prices in Seoul rose 0.18 percent last week, the highest rate since the 8.2 measures. Amid the mounting housing prices that are rarely seen, the government has unveiled a new way to calculate lending. When calculating the total debt service rate, DTI, the loan performance is calculated by both the new and the existing mortgage loan principal. If additional loans are taken out from an annual income worker with a mortgage of 200 million won and an apartment in a speculative area, the new DTI would reduce the mortgage loan rate by more than 90 million won. Lending screening also becomes tricky. Although I have only received one year's income before, I will check and reflect my income for two years starting next year.< Recording > Cho Young-moo (research fellow at LG Economic Research Institute) : "" To ensure that multiple homeowners can not borrow more money, we can not see a need for stronger screening for income evidence and a need for tighter mortgage loans. "" Young couples and newlyweds are entitled to a loan ceiling higher than the average loan applicant, excluding their obligation to confirm two-year income. In addition, if temporary mortgage loans are made due to move in, existing mortgage loans will only reflect interest payments.

Although Mr A raised the question at the back of the table for the corresponding mobile network operator, he was told, "" Public relations 1Gbps are maximum speeds, and depending on the facility or terminal at the installation location, they could be different from the actual speeds provided. ""Beginning in May next year, the U.K. will be unable to advertise Internet products at their fastest speed. That is why it is a fake and exaggerated advertisement that attracts consumers. Instead, UK mobile service providers should advertise at the average speed at which more than half of their customers experience.According to the BBC on July 26, the British Advertising Standards Commission (ASA) derived such regulations in consultation with telcos, consumer groups, and Ofcom Communications Regulatory Commission (Ofcom).Up to now, Internet companies have been allowed to promote such phrases as "" top speed, "" even though only 10 percent of UK subscribers are at the speed at which they can actually be used.However, according to an ASA survey of consumers's understanding of the speed of the broadband Internet, most people were confused by ads they didn't really experience. Advertisements should then begin in May next year based on the "" average "" speed available to more than 50 percent of the subscribers during peak hours. In addition, Internet companies let subscribers take their own tests on service speed by showing how to measure the speed through ads.Matt Hancock, Minister of Digital, Culture and Midianeer, said it was "" victory for the consumers. "" Only 10 % of subscribers have the speed at which they can be used as advertising. The subscribers need clear, concise and precise information.Accordingly, starting next May, the contents of ads will be revised slightly. Andrew Ferguson, the editor-in-chief of IT media ThinBeroadband, is currently implementing speeds of up to 76 Mbps ; the service sold is going to be 45Mbps - 55Mbps for 24 Mbps ads, and Meanwhile, Korea`s Iton-sab Corporation claims to be a Giga-class Internet, even though it exceeds the download standard of 100 Mbps. In particular, the minimum guaranteed speed of the Giga Internet, which can deliver up to 1Gbps of speed, is only 150 Mbps, 15 % of the maximum speed, according to each company's clauses. However, the government is saying that if the agency announces the contents of the restriction, it is not a problem.KT's Giga LTE TV commercial. In fact, last year, Park Hong-keun, a fisherman's lawmaker, pointed out that the products promoted by KT were fake and exaggerated. Giga-LTE is an add-on service provided by KT to subscribers over the 65 rate system at no extra charge. KT claimed in its video ads introducing the service last year that it is four times faster than the existing wireless Internet speed. KT stressed a maximum speed of 1.167 Gbps,. However, this was a limited speed which, due to the nature of the technology, could only be implemented in certain regions and on certain smartphones.The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) investigated the problem earlier this year and stated that "" KT has not faithfully informed us of the limitations of its terms of use, but that service is not meant to be free of charge "" and made available to the user as an economic injury. According to a survey conducted by the KCC, only 3.8 percent of KT's total base stations had access to Giga LTE services. However, the commission has advised the agencies to provide clear information notices to enhance users ` options and prevent misunderstanding of information.

"Kim Jong Un's Well-Conscious Communist Party Vice Chairman Kim Jong Un's Good advice to the North to use his weight-oriented, state-oriented messages with politics The second round of the 7th general meeting of the Labor Party on July 7 was followed by large-scale appointments. This time, he aimed at the military-level bureau. According to the National Intelligence Service, Kim Jong-un has served as vice chairman of the party's Central Committee and punished Hwang Byung-seo, chief of the party`s Central Committee, and Kim Won-hong, head of the Central Intelligence Agency. The head of the political bureau was second in power during the Kim Jong-il era when he called for military-first politics. He remained the same during the Kim Jong Un administration. The punishment of the head of the general political affairs bureau means a drastic change in the structure of power. The trend has already been detected. The day after the second round of talks, he began to appear at the 20th anniversary of Kim Jong Il's inauguration as general secretary on October 8. The Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the Workers ` Party, listed participants in the order of Kim Yong-Hyun, Choi Yong-hae, Park Bong-ju and Hwang Byung-seo. Previously, it was Kim Yong-Nam-Hwang Byeong-seo - Park Bong-ju - Choi Yong-hae. In the order of calling the members of the Board of Directors of the Political Office, the books dropped to fourth from the previous two. It is a shift between Choi Yong-hae and the position. Kim Young-Nam`s standing committee chairman is an elderly woman who appears to be a widow. In other words, Choi Yong-hae has become the second most powerful person in the world. It is interpreted that Kim Jong Un's recent aim at the presidency was the last step to take control of the North Korean People's Army. The political bureau is in charge of promoting the party's political projects, ranking military officials and controlling party memberships in military operations. Chairman Kim Jong-il defined the role of the political committee members in sending troops to the military base by the political bureau. The political committee is the representative of the Labor Party sent to the unit, he said. If the military commander is responsible for the troops, the political committee member will take political and party responsibilities. We should fight incomprehensibly against the party even if it sees small phenomena within its own ideological system. "" General of the National Assembly : emblem of the military "" makes Kim Jong-il a symbol of the North Korean military. Until his death in 1994, the People's Armed Forces statue was a symbol of the military. Under him were Chief of Staff and General Secretary of Political Affairs. However, when Kim took power, the head of the General Political Bureau took the position. The military determined that it could be a threat to the regime at any time. The general political power has firmly taken control of the military trends, allowing it to prevent threats to the regime, including military coups. Cho Myung-rok (1888-2010) sat as head of the General Political Bureau when Kim took power. After Korea's liberation from Japan, he returned to OnggI Port in North Hamgyong Province in rotation with Kim Jong-il, along with Jeon Mun-seop (1919-98) who served as chief of the National Defense Agency. After becoming the head of the General Affairs Bureau in 1995, Cho took over until his death to form an army loyal to Kim Jong-il. After Cho Myung-rok's death, Kim remained as the first Deputy Director of the General Affairs Bureau without appointing anyone as head of the National Political Affairs Bureau. The head of the General Affairs Bureau is under fire for appointing the "" right arm of the right arm. "" Kim Jong-un has replaced five of his top two chiefs of staff (Lee Young-ho - Hyun Young-chul - Kim Kyok-sik - Lee Young-kil - Lee Myung-soo) in the past six years. The same is true of the people's armed forces, ranked third in the military. Kim Jung-gak, Kim Kyeong-sik, Jang Jeong-nam, Hyun Young-chul, Park Young-sik were replaced five times. The People`s Armed Services Committee said it was only Choi Yong-kyung - Kim Gwang-hyeop - Kim Chang-bong - Choi Hyeon-oh - Kim Jong Un's head of the army during his 17-year tenure. However, only two of his top sons, Choi Yong-hae (2012-2014) and Hwang Byung-seo (2014-2017), have served as bureau chiefs of government during Kim's six-year term. So far, the General Affairs Bureau has produced many ' political soldiers. ' Kim Won-hong is known to have been punished for his behavior. He served as director of the general affairs bureau in 2011, but was appointed as the head of the National Intelligence Service in April 2012 when the Kim Jong Un administration took office. He was purged early this year and returned to Korea in April as First Deputy Director of the General Policy Bureau. People's Army chief Park Young-sik and his wife Kim Soo-gil, chairman of the ruling party's ruling party, also served as heads of the political and political bureau. Unlike the chiefs of the General Staff and the heads of the People's Armed Forces, who frequently replaced Kim Jong-un, the North's ruling Workers ` Party apparently intended to punish the chiefs of the winning General Affairs Bureau this time for frequent military discipline. Meanwhile, some sources in North Korea said, Some say the punishment was inevitable because corruption was discovered while inspecting the military. In this situation, Kim Jong-un has left the job to Choi Yong-hae. Under the leadership of the year of Choi Yong-hae, the leadership of the party investigated the political bureau by raising an issue of its impure attitude toward the party, the NIS said in a parliamentary briefing. Choi Yong-hae was in charge of adding members of the party's Central Military Commission and the party's chief in the last major post. North Korea has not announced the party chief in detail, but the National Security Strategy Institute estimates that he is the head of the party's organizational leadership. Considering the status of Choi Yong-hae, he decided that he had no other position to fill than the head of the organizing committee. As the Uri Party intends to keep the people's army under its control, the head of the organizing committee directly coaches the party committee, which is set up by the Central Party, the Army, and the Cabinet, and controls the ideology. It was formerly held by Kim Il-sung's brother Kim Young-ju (1960-73) and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il (1973-2011). The OC was divided into four categories : main unjust, national, military, and administrative. The military sector is in charge of guiding the three major organizations of the People's Army : the General Government, the General Headquarters of Korea's Civil Affairs Ministry and the People's armed forces. Choi Yong-hae was able to punish Hwang Byung-seo and Kim Won-hong through this route. Despite being ranked as the second most powerful person, he is still tied to the leadership. The head of the political bureau should reflect on himself, said Chang Jin-sung, head of the New Focus Bureau of Internet news at Taebukmin, head of the organizing committee that leads the political bureau. As the head of the political bureau who represented the era of the military-first army was forced out of the political hierarchy, the center of gravity is shifting from the military-first ruling camp to the pro-party politics. Im Eul-chul, a professor at Kyungnam University, said, As the military-first politics has highlighted the image of North Korea as a military power and he could be imprisoned in the frame of being a military dictator, Kim Jong-un was trying to escape. By beating out its head general, the ruling camp has a message of devaluing the military and aiming to become a normal socialist state. The focus of a normal socialist country is not on the military, but on the party. Kim Jong-un is said to be giving Choi Yong-hae "" power "" because of his powerless and genuine advice. Kim Jong-il made a will to write important to Kim Jong-un, speaking plainly as he had no need to form his own power as an anti-Japanese partizan II. The presidential office of the wife of Choi Yong-hae is a distant relative of the late Kim Il-sung's mother, Kang Ban-seok, who graduated from the Mansudae Art Club. There, I found Ko Yong-hee, the mother of Kim Jong-un. As a result, the Choi Yong-hae couple are inseparable from Kim Jong-un. Choe Yong-hae was also introduced in Kim Il-sung's memoir, "" With the Century. "" Choi Yong-hae briefly attended the funeral on the day of his mother Kim Chul-ho's death, and then went to the People's Culture Palace to attend an international preparatory committee to celebrate the 13th International Youth Festival. I was reminded of that same son in my father when I received the report. However, there is no eternal ' second lieutenant ' in North Korea. Choi Yong-hae can also step down anytime. He was reportedly demoted to the provinces in 2014 when Kim Jong-un was reported to have established his own connections within the military. Chang Chin-sung, chairman of the ruling Workers ` Party, said, Choi Yong-hae is the last descendant of a family of the anti-Japanese revolution that is the root of the North Korean regime, but he is just an honorary symbolic authority like Kim. This means that North Korea can be punished at any time within its ruling elite. Jang argued that Choi himself is always conscious of this. Choi Yong-hae's father, Choi Hyun-Hyun (1907-1982), was also very close to Kim Il-sung, but he often threatened people with pistols and gave women a brand name at the People's Liberation Army conference in April 1976. North Korea's former intelligence chief attended the funeral of the former People's Armed Forces Award. Unlike many others, Kim Jong-il (fourth) looks straight in the face without bending his head. From the left, Kim Il, Kim Il-sung, Oh Jin-woo, Kim Jong-il, Lee Jong-ok. Choi Hyun also had a love-hate relationship with Kim Jong-il. As for the North Korean compiled "" Kim Jong-il's war, "" the eighth general meeting of the ruling Workers ` Party in February 1974 was the first time Kim Jong Il was confirmed as the party's political committee member, and the first anti-Japan communist leader was quoted as saying by Choi Hyun-oh and Oh Jin-woo. Choi Hyun-Hyun was the most important contributor to Kim Jong-il's succession, but he was at odds over spreading the movement of the three revolutions to the military. The movement of the three revolutionary groups is to eliminate bureaucracy and formalism by sending college graduates, including young intelligences, technology, and culture to society. Kim Il-sung has given the command to Kim Jong-il. Choi expressed his military independence and authority against their entrance into the army. There are also rumors that Kim Jong-il was restrained by soldiers who stood guard at the entrance to the unit when he visited Choi Hyun. The photograph on the 4th page of the Workers ' Party's Journal on April 11, 82 seems to represent Kim Jong-il and Choi Hyun. Members of the executive committee of the political bureau, including Kim Il-sung, Kim Il Il Sung, Oh Jin-woo, and Lee Jong-ok, looked straight in front of the body with their heads bent. It is not clear whether there were any regrets, but it shows the ineligibility of power.

According to reports, the survey conducted by the Japan National Geographic Information Institute confirmed that the area has a maximum rise of 30cm. As a result of the tsunami, the plan to restore damage from the tsunami or the construction process has changed, according to a recent report. Japan's National Geographic Information Institute confirmed last year that all 573 locations affected, including Iwate (peaks of cm), Miyagi (Fukushima), and Fukushima (Fukushima), were found to have risen by approximately 30 degrees (Ashinoma) in October 2011. Miyagi Prefecture announced in March this year that it would review its plan to restore about 23 percent of its 382 embankments, or 89. In some areas, the company changed its original construction plan and shortened the length of its bank, Mainichi said.

"Discriminating Students at Graduate Schools of Engineering - Is there implicit discrimination among graduate students who attend graduate schools and universities with doctorate degrees? In some schools in Seoul, even the same graduate school is said to discriminate unconfessedly with the same undergraduate students who graduated from this school, and with six undergraduate degrees."" You're from another university. There are limits, "" Kim, a graduate student at the Department of liberal arts and sciences at S University in Seoul, submitted to the school three months ago. Although it has been less than a year since he entered the graduate school of his choice, the reason was that he was exhausted by mental stress. Another student is Leter Webcomb. Kim said, The wall of exclusion and discrimination faced by the hard-fought graduate school was high and routine. The modern version of the goal system is at graduate school, and students call themselves six by calling themselves bone marrow, rare bone and other students. The phenomenon of excluding other students from entering university has stirred controversy two times. In 2013, Ewha Womans University Community School was allowed to use other students, but was limited to undergraduate and graduate students at Ewha Womans University due to opposition from its members. In Seoul National University Community (Nulife) in 2014, controversy erupted over net blood flow as innocent SNU graduates claimed they could not regard another student as a member of SNU. Currently, the Seoul National University community has a graduates ` lounge that is only available to undergraduates or graduates, in addition to its exclusive message board, which divides the student body into graduate and undergraduate students. The report showed that not a few graduate students from other schools still appear to be discriminated against in a big or small way upon entering graduate school. The report was carried out by analyzing the data on the status of graduate students, and also providing separate online materials. Due to the closed-end nature of graduate schools, online material coverage was essential as graduate students spoke in an anonymous online space. Twitter accounts from the bamboo forest near the tower and BRIC communities were also covered. The bamboo forest account next to the Hugol Tower is used mostly as a channel for communication among graduate students of humanities and social sciences, with more than 70,000 tweets and 1,500 followers. For graduate students in engineering, internal information is shared by the Biological Research Center (BRIC) Community. We also contacted graduate students face-to-face and listened to the vivid stories. According to some graduate students, there is a difference between other students and their peers from graduate admission to preferred universities in Seoul. Choi (28), a graduate student at another university and a graduate school in the humanities or social sciences, said, Undesignated undergraduate graduates are dropped out if they do not like their performances at all. A less attractive undergraduate of this school will pass. According to some graduate students, academic advisor designates undergraduates at this school to his lab and takes the entrance exams. Is this a good year? Choi, who has supported the university entrance process as a teaching assistant, said, The professors have selected their own students first, and then arranged the other applications in order. Professors then looked through the papers while Choi was watching, saying, Is this school a good place? Choi, who is not from a good school, said, I felt humiliated. Although it may be performance-oriented once she enters, there is discrimination at the beginning. It is questionable whether he will hire another student to finance the tuition business. Graduate students from this school recognize the existence of some of these distinctions. Lee (28), an academic student at B University, found a job as an undergraduate after two failed graduate school admissions. Lee said, "" I learned that the college entrance exam had been set up in advance. Lee then listened to his professor's undergraduate classes and took a free pass that year. Professor Lee said, There was a professor who had made contact with me beforehand at the university entrance interview. Although I asked the same question for fairness, I was asked mainly about specific research plans with nuances that would have been accepted. Other students say that they are easily excluded from human relations after entering graduate school. Lee (29), a graduate student at a university who graduated from another university in engineering, said, It is hard to get another student involved in academic events. Students who are adopted by their own university will be highlighted from the welcome reception of freshmen, which is the first button of their graduate life. We create a vicious cycle that will make it difficult for them to participate in future lab meetings. "" Studying Company "" Webtoons are called ' studying company ' because of high workload among sad graduate students. Besides, other students should try to form a new human relationship in a self-deprecating environment. You have to shoulder the whole burden of being "" adaptive. "" There are limitations to forming human relationships. "" Sometimes, students do not share their experiences with others during their studies, "" one graduate student said. Other students complained that it was difficult to compete with each other in a small society. Shin (27), a graduate student from another school, said, If we don`t last long, we are branded as losers. In the narrow academic arena, graduate students from other schools are apt to be isolated, he said. In fact, he dropped out of the lab because he couldn't adapt to the atmosphere of excluding other students. The Webtoons, ' or "" Portrait of Sad Graduate Students, "" by the Korea University's General School Student Union also described discrimination against other students. Regarding this, some college students say, I will look after my junior without any special discrimination. Regarding this, Kim Sang-bong, former chairman of the private society without any educational backgrounds, said, You need to distinguish between academic ties and educational backgrounds. Going to the same school does not necessarily lead to an educational background, he says. As a natural relationship, what college students call, is the transformation from a graduate school to an academic clique. In the process, other students ' voices are likely to be heard off the hook. "" Perhaps the child is a little bit stronger at the basics than another student, "" says some female magnetics. "" You have limits "" One graduate student's Twitter account may show more discrimination. According to a SNU variety committee survey, female graduates from other schools are excluded from the discrimination scheme of discrimination by 28.5 percent and 24.8 percent. Sometimes the professor directly leads the exclusion and discrimination. An anonymous Internet user, who said he is a master of science and engineering from another university, is treated as if he had no other students.A child is a child prodigy, and a professor cares about little things, he argued. Oh (28), a graduate student from another university whose major is engineering at D University, said, Some professors neglect (others) or do not expect anything. Some professors give their studies to their favorite students. There are more professors like this than I thought. Many other students complained of being frustrated, saying, I get discouraged before I even start my studies. More than a few graduate students work as assistant teachers and make up for part of their tuition, which often excludes other students from the list. One graduate student, estimated as a child, told a prospective graduate student at the bamboo forest next to the Urgol Tower that "" Our school has a tuition system that pays for itself, so we have less money to pay, but we also have to go on a tutoring course. "" Yoon, a graduate student from another university, humanities and social studies, said, I think you have to be a child to know better. Really? I have just entered graduate school and applied for more than 10 applications during the semester, but I can`t pick any. I wonder if my brother-in-law is already nominated. In some laboratories, an upperclassman who took over jobs was the most likely to exclude other students from their jobs.For science and engineering departments, the extra cost of experiment adds to the tuition burden. One engineering major said, I feel uneasy about the burden right now (Professor of Leadership), saying, "" I can not support you because I am another student. "" Other graduate students said, I have seen such professors often. Why doesn't he do chores?A student union official explained, "" If we post notices on the academic department's website, the students will support us. "" In fact, it is important that an administrative assistant has special ability when the professor interviews with the students, he said. Some graduate students from other schools give up their dreams of becoming a scholar. A college of humanities and social science, Kim (age : 25), said, I think it would be wise to quickly find another way before things grow. Lee said, If I am a university student, I often think I can become a professor. Although it is not stated, when other university students go to school, they should give up their dream of becoming a professor. Cho (age 30), a graduate student from another university who graduated from a science and engineering department, said, Some university students send their own students abroad to learn advanced technologies, while others only conduct basic experiments. Cho says he has never said anything unpleasant even though he has been working on laboratory chores. `` At first I didn't feel any serious discrimination. Even when he's in college, why does he do nothing but experiment?"" It was about time, "" he recalls. One day, two years later, the advisor told Cho outright, You are a different student, so you have limitations. Don't let them try anything else. Cho's laboratory, where students enrolled one at a master's degree each year, is known to have had only children. One former engineering doctor from another university also said, I spent one year helping seniors experiment or doing laboratory chores for my doctorate degree, especially during the first year I wrote a research plan. As much of a hurry as students from other schools have any discrimination against their graduates, said Kim Tae-hak, 26, a graduate student at the junior high and high schools. However, her remarks were different from those of other students. "" Now, "" Jeong said."
"It is a lie that the great man does not discriminate at all against the other man. I want to ask whether you are hypnotized by your own thoughts because you don`t have any discrimination. Other students are reportedly frustrated by the implicit flow of words from their study room, where the majority of students are attending. The saying, Of course other students will be incompetent. On the other hand, it would be hard to say anything about other students unless they were made explicit, Oh explained. Minor discrimination against other students is most noticeable when a student from a local university enters a prestigious university in Seoul, due to the nation`s university system. In the Seoul Metropolitan area, universities with high entrance guidelines have also distinguished graduates from lower schools. This is seen as the influence of academic background culture and pure blood in graduate schools that evaluates people as a result of college entrance exams. The share of Korean university crossing is 88 % (female university graduates are hired), Yonsei University 76 % and Korea University 60 %. It is said to be too high a level for the universities of the United States and Europe. The university's puderacy is a collective effort to exclude others, said Seol Dong-hoon, a professor at Jeonbuk University. A mentality like, "" I don't want to discriminate against other students, but my junior first, "" is a pure blood ideology. It makes the group more closed-oriented. Some graduate students from other universities complain of the great popularity of blood and depression. A graduate student from another university, a 29-year-old engineering major, said, I felt I was in a position to be humble. He became alienated from himself and his self-esteem was diminished. Eventually, I suffered from personal aversion and depression. A graduate student from another university, Chung, also said, I could not get out of the race when I heard that you had washed your educational background. Some other students said, "" Is it really useful to announce that we are discriminated against? We just talk to each other and get upset. Institutional support for graduate students from other schools is insufficient. Kim Seon-woo, head of the Korea University's General University Graduate School of Public Studies, said, Although schools are setting up systems at the human rights center and others, we don`t expect many original students to have used them until now. It is a difficult structure to talk about. Discrimination against other students is not noticeable. Students from other schools who interviewed students also cautioned against generalization, "" It varies between laboratories and professors. "" I have often heard stories from volunteers during the coverage process saying "" Our laboratory people are so kind that they do not discriminate against others. "" A 29-year-old science and engineering student said, "" If you think it is a rent, you can never develop. "" A graduate student from another school said, It is difficult for a graduate student to change the rules and systems. We need to discuss the discrimination against graduate students from other schools, said Chung. ※ This article was written by the students in the Department of Media Writing at Korea University.Korea University gimjunyeong department Ahn Hee Jae in third grade, 3rd grade in sociology at Korea University, ▶ Sindonga latest issue of view and ▶ to Subscriptions to the magazine's issue together.

The new DTI is the total principal payment amount if it has at least two mortgage loans (each share) to reflect the maximum coverage of the car debt.Until now, if one or more of the owners who owns more than one more shares receives an additional debt, only the annual interest on the existing shares will be included in the debt, but the new DTI will have to pay back all of the existing shares and the annual interest on the existing ones. As a result, the amount of additional loans will decrease as the amount of debt to be repaid each year. As a result, multiple residents who want to purchase more homes in speculative areas will see their loan amounts drop significantly due to the introduction of the new DTI. For example, an annual income of 100 million won per annum, when he or she tries to receive loans from speculation zones in 30 years, is equivalent to 20 percent of the annual interest rate divided by the principal and interest rate of each year.A can receive mortgage loans on apartments in speculative areas on the condition that he or she can dispose of the existing home within two years. However, the DTI is limited to 30 percent. If the DTI is applied, the loan amount of A would be 411 million won, but when the new DTI is applied, it would be 910,000 won and 22.1 percent less.On the other hand, the introduction of the new DTI is likely to reduce the size of loans or increase in future earnings for the homeless. If he earned 35 million won per year for two years and had no interest in paying the monthly rent, he would have to take out a mortgage on a home in the region of 20.However, if the government submits evidence for earned income over the past two years to reflect the expected future increase in income, the figure will grow to 385 million won. That means that the total increase in the amount of 91 million won and 31 percent is expected to come from that point. However, each financial institution will determine its own percentage of the expected future income recognition.Lee Hyung-ju, director of the Financial Policy Bureau at the Financial Services Commission, said, "" Checking a two-year's income is to determine how stable a person's income is and to look at the latest in order to assess his or her ability to repay it. ""Lee especially admitted, "" The DTI has the right to be given absolutely to this limit by consumers, but has stated, "" The DTI is the highest limit and the general availability of DTI is that it is possible to get a DSR when there is a good reason for this being done by banks. ""Following the new DTI, the government will introduce a DSR-De bt Service Ratio system to the banks in the fourth quarter of next year. DSR represents the percentage of annual income that all debt principal and principal payments take up. It is called a tougher regulation than the new DTI, including not only the main creditor but also all loans from the financial sector including credit and the negative account.DSR said, "" Income will be calculated in the same way as the new DTI, but if it is difficult to calculate income based on the same criteria, the financial institutions will be given autonomy. "" The key application ratio of DSR will allow financial institutions to assess the cash-based company`s ability to repay itself.It also reflects the actual payment burden of the owners according to the type of loans (lending by credit card, credit limit loan), and payment method (repayment by installment and temporary payment). It is estimated that rental loans are to be paid separately for 10 years, since they can be exchanged with a rental deposit, which includes only the amount of interest payment."
""" The teacher said while showing us the page of the graduates. I went to Samsung. Isn't it ugly? Fat. Such a student has gone, so you can go too.I told her I wanted to go to the financial sector, and she looks at me. You should lose weight and be pretty with a smiling face. He also said, ' On October 29, the day of the students ' Day, about 50 students from specialized high schools gathered at Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul. ' It was the remarks of one of the students who participated in the meeting. Students were also criticized for wage discrimination, sexual discrimination and poor academic performance in the field. Students claimed 10 things : the right to be discriminated against, the right to be ignored, the right to work in human rights training, and the right to be not forced to work. Special admission high school means a high school that operates specialized education courses to foster human resources and professionals in specific fields. However, some students at specialized schools first learned the ' discrimination ' rules before specialized education. The students of specialized high schools began to voice themselves, dating back to July. They formed a group and held a news conference at the Gu Station 9-4 subway station, which is the scene of the "" Gu's station screen accident "" on subway line No. 2. They vowed to change it personally to make sure it does not happen again. Last May, Kim, who was a student at Sunghwa High School, was working for a company that went out to the field. In January of this year, a junior high school student who had been practicing at LG U-Plus ' customer center's cancellation and defense department ended his life due to work stress. ■ Three students of Sisa IN Sun-yeong's Special High School Rights Union shared their thoughts in the conference room.The ministry examined field practice at 593 schools and 31,144 companies nationwide in March, and found the highest number of cases of cases of failure to sign a standard agreement (238 cases). Students who experienced overtime (95 cases), unfair treatment (45 cases), harmful and dangerous work (43 cases), unpaid wages (27 cases), and sexual harassment (17 cases) were also hard to do. As of 2016, there are 472 (vocational) specialized high schools nationwide. The Distinctive High School Students ' Rights Association held its founding meeting on Nov. 11 and decided to continue its activities such as declaring the rights of 20,000 students at specialized high schools and urging the establishment of the Youth Labor Protection Law. High school students who belonged to specialized high schools, but were also trained to work for professional schools. As of October 29, there are 820 members. The problem with specialized high schools is not just field trips. I met three students at Suksung High School and I heard about my special high school experience. Although the academic background and characteristics of the schools were different, the three looked at each other with disappointment. Am I a student or a worker? Kim Yoo-seon (alias · 18), a junior high school junior high school specialized in finance, learned that there is a school with priority from her older sister who attended a specialized high school. I was looking for a commercial school, and now I have a kite. Teachers at the middle schools did not know much about the characterization high schools. She was only interested in sending her to specialized schools such as foreign language high schools. It was up to the individual to find the school. I was very disappointed after I entered school. As I entered the school with only the good points in promoting my school, I saw many bad sides. Fewer students studied than I thought. I was in a quandary because I couldn't transfer. I couldn't adapt myself to the beginning of the semester, so I thought I would drop out. It is fair to say, "" You can do well if you study hard. "" ■ On October 29, 50 or so students at Characterization High School announced their rights to 2,000 students at Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul.As for Kim, her experience in overseas activities alone is about 30. A number of certificates and awards were needed for work. Teachers encouraged Kim to work at the bank. The school prefers, but I don`t want to. I said put it in, but I don't think it will work. They dropped and threw away the time. "" Each February, the school sets the statistics of graduates who are employed by the student in the practical course. Since various support is decided based on the employment rate, some are even troubled because they focus on raising the employment rate regardless of quality. When she comes back from field trips, she sometimes puts her work rates on the books. In third grade, an outside instructor taught me how to make my face. It is for interview purposes. If your lips are too red, you need a proper color to look awkward and alive. The teacher told the girls to get plastic surgery on their eyes. I told my chubby friends to stop eating. Kim, who is rather black, was told to stay home because she was too dark. Kim finished her three-month field practice until October. I usually finish the first semester of the third grade and go to practice for the second semester. It was a 10-member trading company and was assigned to marketing. It was a department she hadn't had before she came in. There was no previous education, either. I took a marketing course when I was in third grade, but I lacked the relevant knowledge. I taught myself while taking an online lecture. It was difficult because there was no system. Although she was offered a full-time job, Kim went back to school. It was too far from home and the minimum wage was disappointing. According to his friends, he was often treated unfairly during field trips. As she walks by in her skirt, she is told, ' Mr ○○ will burst out of her skirt ' or she is told to drink at a diner. Kim went to specialized high school, where she experienced a lot of identity confusion. I felt something was not respected. The identity is ambiguous. I think he's a student, but he's got a job. The same is true even after you work. Whether you are a college graduate or a high school graduate, you learn the same thing and do the same thing, but you earn different salaries. Some said, ' You should have gone to college if you want to get more. ' However, they made different choices …. Considering their academic background, the wage gap was too wide. It is not understandable why students are paid the minimum wage when they are not even Arvite (Korea Labor Institute's minimum wage is based on matching high school records as of September 2015, and the wage level for college graduates is 141 "" Lee Ho-seong (alias · 18), who attends specialized high school in IT, has been interested in computers since he was a child. After attending the education organized by the current high school, I listened to the principal's advice to be admitted and decided to go to school. Lee's parents, who also finished second in the middle school, expected his son to go to specialized high schools, but wanted to learn computer skills systematically. Lee is proud of his school. The competition rate for admission is also high. These days he is preparing to go to college. The advantage of specialized high schools is that you can study as you please. Lee, too, liked it. However, the IT system changes its knowledge everyday, and lessons can not keep up. It was normal for me to go to school for an hour or so without any sleep. I was also fascinated with my major subjects and had to keep my grades. When he was working out, he always lacked sleep. While doing overseas activities, I experienced prejudice against specialized high schools. Even when they entered the event and announced their IT skills, some looked unhappy because they were graduates of specialized high schools. Special schools appear to be blind to job searching, and regular high schools appear blind to universities, said Lee Ho-seong, a senior researcher at the school. He has also seen bad examples of his friends who went on field trips. It was not uncommon for work hours to be missed. He did not inform his friend who went to an IT firm for practice, but gave him the responsibility of creating a web page. He used a lot of abuse when he made mistakes, even though he had no working experience. I had to go to hospital because I was stressed out. In the end, he resigned and moved on. The school hasn't even been aware of the fact that it's been changing jobs for a while. When I saw my friend's struggle, I thought it was an especially unusual case, but it wasn't. Students can not easily quit despite unfair treatment by businesses. Not only is it damaging to juniors, but some schools also punish them. "" If the company gets out of order, it's normal to return home, but I really think it's my fault to take corporal punishment. "" I would rather have the subjects related to labor rights as a curriculum. It is because it is essential for students. In August, the government unveiled a plan to improve the job-seeking field experience, shifting from a work-oriented to learn-centric and shorten the period from less than six months to about a month. Students were concerned that it would make companies have no reason to hire special students. Lee also said, "" It is not a question of time, but of management. "" Schools are encouraging people to work at home. It is not bad to have good friends who go to university first. There is a "" go to school after getting a job. "" It is a system that enables students to enter university if they stay in an industry for more than three years after graduating from specialized high schools. The few cases that succeeded in entering a prestigious university are known as the success story. The door is as narrow as that. Starting two years ago, the number of applicants for special admission to special schools for university dropped from 3 percent to 1.5 percent. This is because the government is set to emphasize the importance of job opportunities. Lee Ho-seong said, "" I can't study, so I go to specialized high school. "" I went because I wanted something. They've always thought about their future anyway. "" Recently, he had a dream to continue studying this field and become a professor. Shin Yoo-rim (alias · 17), who had little desire to work when she was out of the spotlight, told junior high school teacher, "" If you don't think about college, go to vocational high school and take charge of course support. "" I wanted to go to business school more, but I applied for it safely because my grades didn't match. I felt uneasy because I had to go to normal high school when I fell. Some came to get an aptitude and some came to get good grades. Shinyang is an accounting major. School life was busier than I thought. He had to prepare for various events including certificates. She even prepared for two things at the same time while taking the midterm. At school, job placement guidance is available."
