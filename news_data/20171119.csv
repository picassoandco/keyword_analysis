"▽ Battery Action in China 〓 Kim Young-Hyun, a reporter of Yonhap News Agency, offered three to four times more salary to Korean staff. "" I heard that she has offered an annual salary of 400 million to 500 million won for her past 10 years or more. "" (A) The domestic battery industry has received a warning against the outflow of staff. China is waging an all-out campaign to recruit Korean luxury human resources by shouting "" battery powered "" and making large-scale investments. As China, which has narrowed its technology gap with Korea's core workforce in semiconductor and electronics sectors, has sought to cater to the next generation of food - batteries, it needs to prepare measures by the government as well as the industry. According to the industry on July 19, major Chinese battery makers are on a massive offensive to recruit engineers and research development from major Korean companies, including LG Chem, Samsung SDI, and SK Innovation. Mr. A said, "" Headhunting companies with domestic battery industry expertise would have been working with Chinese companies to provide services and would have already received many of their domestic counterparts. "" "" Among them, 30 to 40 % of the key battery users in China were likely to have been interested in pursuing this offer. "" Another industry insider said, Korean workers at an electric car company in China have already been scouted by about 100 people, not even counted how many have been leaked so far. It is still difficult to assess how many more people will leave the company in the future, he said. The battery industry is the one that can win the competition by reducing production costs after developing new technologies at an early stage, such as semiconductors and telecommunications. Whether or not the project will secure research and development personnel depends on it. China, which needs to catch up with Korean and Japanese leaders in the field, can make a battery run at an astronomical cost by recruiting advanced manpower. China, the world`s largest auto consumer market for 30 million new cars per year, plans to bolster the electric car market by 2020. The government is strongly pushing for policies such as providing subsidies to secure the power to lead the electric car industry. Chinese companies are reportedly paying extra attention to providing convenience such as interpretation for the workers they hire. The ministry also intends to hire Korean staff who are reluctant to change jobs due to language barriers. Besides the clandestine scouts, the company also employs its employees in an open recruitment drive via public notice. China's largest electric car company, Viyadi, recently announced that it is seeking a Korean battery workforce for its Guangdong province's Shenzhen (1000 < 960 + 川 >). In addition to the annual salary, the company provided bonuses, year-end bonuses, official car subsidies, and support for paying for cars and living alone. The company has steadily hired Korean employees since last year, and has recently placed Korean employees in key posts, including the head of the Central Research Center, to boost its technology competitiveness. A carmaker is known to have set up a research center in Korea and is bringing in research and development personnel. The annual salary offered by the company is about 100 million won per year as a substitute, and 150 million won per year for the car~sub. There is little we can do to stop the drain on technology, as the electric car battery market is still immature and our business results are not being realized, an industry source said. Major domestic manufacturers are increasing their investment in the field of electric car batteries, but as their performance has not yet been on track, they can not afford to invest in improvements in personnel management. A job offer from Viyadi, China's largest electric car company.

"" Night duty averages three million won, but I can't make that kind of income, "" says Jan Sanghyeok, the director of the convenience store owners ' council. "" We can close our doors in the industry for seven hours now. "" The industry has been discussing various issues, ranging from midnight to 7 a.m., from 1:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., or from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m., but headquarters are reluctant to comment on their complaints. Chairman Jun said the Fair Trade Commission recently announced a revision to the franchise business law that would allow late hours to 7 hours, shorten the loss period to three months, and actively deliver the revision to the Fair Trade Commission, even during the first six hours. Currently, the business hours for the late-night snack store are from 1:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Brokers can shorten their hours if they lose business during the six-month window. However, since there are stores that the headquarters directly rent stores and trust to the owners, the longer they operate, the more advantageous they can reduce subsidies such as electricity bills for non-holiday stores. "" The recent request that GS25 give each other 35 billion won of electricity for itself at night to the store shows how much you need to work late, and that makes it hard for the headquarters to work late, "" said Alvar.The minimum wage increase on the convenience store shelves affects not only the presidents but also the working conditions of the workers. A worker at a gas station in Seoul recently heard from his boss that he would reduce one of his employees due to labor costs. Three of the employees are still on shift 24 hours to 3 hours, but instead of having to reduce the staff to 2, the company is planning to switch to self-shifting late at night. "" I will reduce one person without cutting them all because I have to do such things as cleaning or washing the car, "" he said, adding, I knew that in the long run, I was planning to switch to a self-service gas station. "" We don't have to work two shifts, "" he said, adding, "" but sometimes we have to deal with the same problems as the three of us in cleaning or in office. "" Gas station businesses expect this to happen at gas stations nationwide. As the wage increase adds to the burden on labor costs, more than 1,000 gas stations will turn into self-service gas stations next year, Kim Moon-sik, head of the Korea Gas Association, forecast.Gas Station [Photo of Yonhap news release] kamja@yna.co.kr"
"Lack of sleep causes debt and builds up daily.Living in a "" sleep debt "" state causes not only safety accidents or poor productivity, but also serious health problems.It illustrates the state of sleep in South Korea, where the OECD average is the shortest.The scene of sleeping with an eye patch on her face. / Lee Joon-hun, a 43-year-old journalist working as a two-shift production worker during the day and night, recently got dizzy. The problem was that he had to keep a driver's seat right after working for 12 hours of night work from 8 p.m. the previous day. As the wedding of an acquaintance was scheduled, I drove from Asan, Chungnam Province, the factory, to Seoul, right after I left work. How long has it been since she got on the highway, Lee experienced an experience in which her eyes were wide open for a moment, but her body fell asleep and wouldn't move. It was only a few seconds, and fortunately, Lee was not involved in any accident, but he was able to start again after taking a long rest after stopping on the side of the road. No wonder he stopped by the nearest rest stop to get some sleep.I have a debt to pay. In a way, it is as serious as the amount of domestic household debt, which is approaching 1400 trillion won. Last night's sleep was piled up in debt to the point of falling asleep needed. Sleep debt is a concept that is spreading throughout the academic circles of sleep after it is revealed that long term lack of sleep negatively affects the health as well as various parts of daily life. Unlike the simple lack of sleep, it is used because it builds up gradually like debt that causes interest to accumulate, and thus affects the body gradually. Korea, which had the shortest average sleeping time in last year's OECD survey, is also a huge country with huge debts. In addition to the direct treatment costs associated with sleep disorders, the cost of safety accidents, falling productivity, and long-term health problems are not easy to determine.What Lee Jin-hyuk, who drove on the highway the night before, is called microsleep. In some cases, it is easy to say that you forgot, but in some cases, you didn't even know you were asleep. Further attention was drawn to the fact that lights flashed in the face of an experiment with sleep-deprived subjects at Stanford University, although it was reported that the results were even more acute. Sleep debt causes disruption in daily life, such as micro-sleeping in the short run. However, one should be cautious in that the long-term debt build up will have a greater negative effect on the economy.■ Just as interest applies to ' micro-sleeping ' debts that can lead to big accidents, sleep debt can accumulate negative effects on the body. If you lack sufficient sleep or have only one or two bad nights, it is not too much to handle, although you are tired. However, when the debts builds up over the long term, the body begins to send out a reminder. Sleep is like a differential pressure scab in that the nerves between the eyes and the brain are temporarily blocked while the flash explodes, preventing vision from functioning properly. Even though people sleep every day, they are more likely to suffer from metabolic disorders such as hyperlipidemia or diabetes because debt builds up from obesity. Studies show that raising blood pressure is not enough to affect cardiovascular diseases, and that the rate of dementia can increase."" When I was younger, I thought I was a night person. When I was in my 20s, I didn't really feel tired when I was working at night in a bar or a karaoke booth. But this day and night life is much harder than I thought. "" Lee works two shifts, one day a week a week and the next at night. I work better during the day, but I usually sleep during the working week. Especially Sunday is the most painful day after Saturday night's work. Sunday morning, when you are tired, you should not fall asleep right away. From Monday, the very next day, I work a day shift, so I have to go to work in the morning. As you put up with sleepiness during the day, you naturally accumulate sleep debt.More serious is the safety issue. The risk of drowsy driving, with fine sleep leading to an immediate accident is more damaging than a normal traffic accident. In the past five years, a total of 2241 accidents happened on the highway, leaving 1,1786 casualties. According to statistics from the National Police Agency and the Korea Highway Corporation, the fatality rate of sleepy drivers on the highway accidents is 2.4 times higher than that of speeding accidents. The working environment that breeds sleep debt is to foster bombs that can cause human casualties everywhere.Office workers take a nap on the Daecheong floor of Hanok Village after lunch in Seoul's Namsan Hanok Village. / reporter Jeong Ji-yoon : The risks of sleep debt increase significantly every year for non-driving businesses are clearly revealed. The Institute of Occupational Safety and Health's study report showed that the combined risk of sleep and lack of sleep for more than 10 hours a day raises the risk of an industrial disaster twice. Jeong Kyung-sook, a professor of occupational and environmental medicine at Dongguk University's Ilsan Hospital, said, "" The number of people surveyed is likely to suffer from sleep disturbances, and the number of people who do not have sleep disorders increased 1.63 times. ""Sleep debt does not just appear for people like Lee working in a special working environment. Individuals need the right amount of sleep, but if anyone fails to meet their sleeping needs, the debt will accumulate as much. Comparing with the OECD countries ` sleep time in 2016, the average Korean slept 41 minutes less than the OECD average of 8:22, the shortest among those surveyed by 7 hours and 41 minutes. If the target is narrowed to an adult, the average sleeping time is shorter. According to a recent study released in July by Gallup Korea, the average amount of sleep among Korean adults was only 6 hours, 24 minutes. Even with the difference in the survey methods, the same survey conducted by Gallup Korea showed that the average adult slept 6 hours and 53 minutes in 2013, which shows that Korean people slept better.This reality is also proven to be true for the growing number of patients visiting hospitals due to sleeping difficulties. According to the National Health Insurance Corporation, the number of patients who complained of sleeping difficulties at medical institutions exceeded 494,000 last year. Compared to 358,000 people in 2012, the figure increased by about 38 percent. Spending on sleeping sickness treatment increased 66 percent from 35.9 billion won in 2012 to 59.7 billion won last year. It is estimated that the adult population, which has suffered from insomnia, one of the most common symptoms, is close to 4 million, or 12 percent.■ Long-work hours are the biggest factor in sleep deprivation : high school seniors in Seoul are sleeping curled up on their desks before a mock test. / reporter Kim Chang-gil says what's worse is that even teenagers in their prime aren't getting enough sleep as they need. In other words, the accumulated amount of sleep debt that will last a lifetime starts with adolescence. According to the Seoul Statistics Analysis, which was announced last year by the Seoul Metropolitan Government to monitor the health of teenagers living in the capital, they slept an average of 6 hours and 6 minutes a day. Sleep shorter than adults. The study, which was conducted five years ago, also showed a reduction of 6 minutes in sleep. As such, the quality and satisfaction of sleep was not as good as it was. Only 27.8 percent of the teens thought they slept enough to recover from fatigue.Even for Kim Eun-jung (41), a parent of two children who are in third grade and first grade, the problem is that they sleep late. After allowing their two children to play games on their smartphones or computers on the weekends, they should play until dawn. "" It was upsetting to know that they could just pick up the phone when they were growing up and sing and just play with the phones even under the covers, "" Kim said, adding, "" After the first grade was in ninth, I sent her first class to a special class at the institute. Until now, there were only one or two subjects to attend an academy, so I never thought that my children would get tired of studying all day, but I don't get tired of being close to midnight when I take a special class for exams. Kim said, "" If I become a high school student and go to college or work, I think I should let myself play even now, and I can't let it get to my head too. ""The problem is that lack of sleep affects waking up as much. One can not abbreviate one or two of the social factors that drive up sleep debt. However, the work environment in Korea, where working hours are long, is cited as the most typical background that encourages sleep debt. Korea has the second longest working hours per year, with an average working time of 2113 hours per person, following Mexico (DS2246) among OECD members. In the case of an office worker, Nomo (34), the reality of staying at work for a long time leads to inefficient sleep and rest, and then to inefficiency in her work. Roh is scheduled to leave the office at 9 a.m., but he does not leave the office at regular intervals. Though there are days when you can leave the office at 6:00 p.m. daily schedule, you will have to wait until 9-10 p.m. as you have a strong culture to watch your boss's quitting time. "" I know that late nights don't necessarily mean late nights, but most of the time I don't need you to spend time at home and at home with Roh's wife. "" However, when they go to bed without enjoying their own time, the couple feel that they have missed a day together. The couple go to bed after 2 a.m., worried that they will be tired again tomorrow. Worries remain the reality at work. Time goes by as much as drinking coffee and smoking to keep you awake. And the day of Kaldzuger's execution"
"The vicious circle of people not leaving their seats easily is repeated. The circumstances at work that led to the creation of "" No dinner "" have already led to an overnight delay in the evenings. In addition, the vicious cycle between sleep debt and work becomes more severe when research shows that the more likely a person is to suffer from insomnia when his or her work ability is poor.■ As they have a negative influence on the relationships between people at work, they spend the time at work due to their debts. And I make up for my lack of free time by reducing sleep. Under these circumstances, the once booming ' Morning Man ' self-development has lost its reality. In 2003, the book, titled ` Dongmyung `, was introduced in Korea at 5 a.m. He stressed that one can achieve more by spending less time on work and personal development, as he stressed the fact that he or she lives twice as long. As a result, it calls for "" short sleep, "" which is negative for sleep doctors. Nishino SeijI, director of the National Sleep Biorythrop Research Center at Stanford University, said, "" The results of an intellectual property study that says short sleep is genetic, and short hours have already been published in < Science >. ""The reason why such a culture of boosting performance by reducing the amount of sleep is dangerous is because the harm of anti-sleep culture is not limited to health or safety issues. Lack of sleep also means lack of awakening, and there are more than one factor contributing to decreased productivity. The effect of sleep debt on society is much more far-reaching. In a study titled ` The Effects of Lack of Sleep on Workplace Rude and Anti-deprivation Activities, ` Im Chang-hee, a business professor at Hongik University, felt that the lack of sleep would cause him to lose control and make him rude. A study found that sleep debt has a variety of negative effects on working relationships and other factors, especially among night and day shift workers who are prone to accumulate sleep debt. Professor Im, who points out that the problem is tissue culture that is obsessed with performance, says, "" Studies show that the lack of sleep after five years of age and the lack of interaction between people who suffer from sleep, anxiety, anxiety and depression have not affected the results of people "" "" Even in the field of creative and concentrative research papers and idea development, the negative effects of sleep deprivation on the working class would have to be increased and decreased in creativity, "" he added. The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) decided to investigate the case to confirm the issue. Kim Seon-ho, a reporter at the Korea Institute of Geological Resources (Yonhap news), said, "" Korea National University of Science and Technology confirmed the release of its liquid research team around Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, on July 15. Liquefaction is the phenomenon of strong earthquake shaking in which muddy water from beneath the ground rises above the surface and changes ground to a liquid state. It is the first time that a liquid disaster has been discovered in Korea since the earthquake, causing massive damage to buildings, such as the Pohang earthquake, which caused buildings to fall down or to fall down. Professor Son's team at Busan University, which plans to produce maps of the nation's active bones after last year's Gyeongju earthquake, announced on July 19 that they found some 100 traces of mud at a radius of 2 kilometers around Pohang's epicenter. There is a record of liquefulness in this country during the major earthquake in the 17th century, however, said the first time a national earthquake has been detected, the team said. When liquidization occurs, the surface of the building is temporarily floating, which is seen as a result of the liquefaction of many buildings, such as the leaning Daesung Apartment in Pohang, said. The team also secured testimony from residents that the fields around the epicenter were ' bubbling up ' during the recent earthquake.Korea Geological Resources Research Institute found on Monday that the volcanic crater lake was located at the bottom of the rice paddy field near the epicenter of the Pohang earthquake in Pohang. The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) decided to investigate the case to confirm the issue. Prior to the earthquake at walden@yna.co.kr in Seoul, the area was completely dry. "" An earthquake has occurred during an active fault investigation and is doing research and analysis, "" Sohn said, "" and said, "" When building structures in an area with liquid effects, the foundations need to be secured in deep rock. "" The Korea Institute of Geological Resources ' field research team confirmed on July 18 that they confirmed about 30 sandbokeins (sand vents) and mud vents (mud vents) that occurred when they were liquid in the soil near the quake's epicenter. The Korea Meteorological Administration is set to investigate Pohang on July 19 to see if it experienced any actual liquefulness during the earthquake. We will meet with Professor Son and share the results of the liquefulness or analysis, an official at the Korea Meteorological Administration and Security Agency said, The ministry will make an official conclusion on the issue in the future. wink@yna.co.kr, (Air Force delivery) / Asahi, a news report … ""yeonggongseo to donghae a formation flight"" ""nuclear weapons with possible political and military significant in 北"" (= 1 News, Seoul, Korea) 2016.1.10 gimhyeji reporters are nuclear weapons.U.S. Air Force strategic bomber that can be with b - 52 in August this year Japan's Air Self-defense Force fighter jets conducted joint training exercises with the Asahi Shimbun reported.Asahi Shimbun on November 19, multiple, citing Japanese officials, the last 52 b In late August after a flight across over Japan Self-Defense Forces aircraft in skies over its forces joined the donghae.The training said.North Korea's east coast close to 52 b can perform a mission to use nuclear weapons.

"[Graphic] Ground ' Liquefaction '? A close examination on the site of the Korea Institute of Geology and Geology in Pohang's seismic zone of 5.5 km from Pohang, South Gyeongsang Province, and analyzed on July 19 by analyzing the analysis of "" Korea's Seismic Damage from Earth, including Buildings and Slope "" In the rice field, the water springs out as it is liquid, and the sand that is raised with it remains. 2017.11.19mtkht@yna.co.kr( ended with a pressure point that has broken out in large areas around the epicenter of the 5.4 earthquake in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province. As a result of an on-site analysis of the first ' liquefaction ' found in Korea after the Pohang earthquake, some academics also analyzed that "" the damage was great, such as when a building crashed or collapsed. "" Liquefaction is the phenomenon of strong earthquake shaking in which muddy water from beneath the ground rises above the ground and momentarily changes the ground to a liquid state. On July 19, the Korea Institute of Geological Resources and Professor Son Moon of Busan University, which manufactures maps of live fault lines in Korea, conducted a field investigation into the liquid crystal ball within 5.5 kilometers of Mangcheon-ri, the epicenter of the town. The liquefaction marks appeared in many different forms. When the rice field was reached from the epicenter to the point of the quake, sand, gravel, and other sediments were raised in the cracks between the floor and ridges. Sedimentation clearly differed from the existing mud on the floor. Around this area, the same shape was seen on the left and right sides. The sediment is said to have been buried underground from two and a half million years ago to recently. We believe the water in the ground was fast enough to lift gravel, said Kim Yong-sik, a senior researcher at the Geological Survey at the Korea Research Institute. The earthquake has put strong pressure on the bottom, said some of them, possibly because the water on the ground has drained away. From here, you can see sand piled up several meters from the bottom of the rice paddy, about 200 meters away from the park. There were long cracks in the middle of the sand deposit or holes filled with water could have been completely drained away. Liquefaction also appeared near the beach, 5.5 kilometers east of the epicenter. One sandy beach in Chilpo-ri, Heunghae-eup, where the river meets the sea, had dozens of tiny sand bottles (sand vents) with diameters of 1cm to 10cm. ▽ Field Survey on Seisming Effect of Earthquakes (Pohang = Yonhap news) = An official of the Korea Geological Resources Research Institute conducts an on-site investigation on Monday morning in Chilpo-ri, Pohang City, North Gyeongsang Province.

Professor Son's team at Busan University found 100 spots where muddy water erupted in a 2-kilometer radius around Pohang's epicenter. In addition, the inspection site also secured testimony from residents that the fields around the epicenter were bubbling up during the quake.Professor Son's team at Busan University conducts a field investigation into the liquid disaster impact at Pohang University of North Gyeongsang Province yesterday.Sohn's team said, When liquidization occurs, the buildings appear to be floating temporarily on the surface of the water, creating a lot of damage, as if they were affected by the leaning Pohang Daesung Apartment.

[Yonhap News Agency : ap] After the coup soldiers were capital, Harare, Zimbabwe citizens are Mugabe of passing along the street, hands up and demanding the resignation of the president.to exist [Yonhap News Agency : afp] placed under house arrest of Robert Mugabe in a military coup (93) first appeared in public 17 (local time) is president of Zimbabwe. The oldest dictator, who was ousted from power after 37 years in power, attended a graduation ceremony at Zimbabwe's University of Communication in Harare, the capital. Mugabe, who holds the post of president, has attended graduation every year, but few expected him to make it this year. As Mugabe's presence is expected, so is the ceremony. Thousands of graduates rose as Mugabe in his academic gown entered the ceremony, and applause erupted over his opening remarks on the red carpet. Mugabe still seemed to retain absolute power. However, foreign news agencies including CNN reported that the graduation ceremony was just a planned event. It is a show to protect his honor as an independent hero. Some in the military that staged the anti-Constitutional coup, it was necessary to give the people the impression they needed. The graduation ceremony ended as if nothing had happened, but Mugabe was in reality rather ' disgraceful ' condition. Mary Chiwen was among thousands of graduates who awarded degrees. She is the wife of General Constantine Chiwenga, the hero of the coup. Now, the military and Mugabe are reportedly negotiating the handover of power. "" Mugabe is calling for more time to go to the military, "" the U.K. Independent reported on July 17. "" Mugabe is refusing to step down, "" seemed quite different from what was reported a day ago. Pressure on Mugabe has also increased. Zimbabwe Liberation War veteran, the largest supporters of a coup, meeting Chris mucheubangwa "" Mugabe, president of the president to finish this tomorrow if we wouldn't stay away.It warned. Reports say high-ranking officials of the ruling African National League (African National League) and the Korean National Defense Front (ZANU-PCM) gathered to prepare for Mugabe's impeachment. The commencement of the coup d’état's wife, Harry Mugabe, was Zimbabwe. After gaining independence from Britain in 1980, he established a country and ruled for 37 years and survived as the world's oldest and longest dictator. But while "" dying in the Oval Office, "" he collapsed much more easily than expected. Some are watching with breathless attention as the iron wall of power collapses in just 10 days. Other dictators in Africa who have exercised their long dictatorship as much as Mugabe. According to the Human Right Foundation, only 14 of the 54 countries on the continent are classified as democracies. The 19 countries are totalitarian states that are often damaged by absolute dictatorship and serious anti-democratic behavior. This means that the fall of Mugabe is not the job of others, but of many dictators. Africa has four leaders who have held power for more than 30 years, like Mugabe. Together, their terms of power will reach 137 years. As CNN pointed out on July 17, they are faithfully following the model of dictatorship that eliminates term limits and oppress the opposition by revising the constitution. Teodoro Obiang Nguema of Equatorial Guinea (75) 79, is president of Francisco Macías was from power, wield tyranny in a coup. However, Eungema, who had announced her new start, also followed suit. Now Equatorial Guinea is regarded as the most oppressive and anti-democratic country in the international community. Parliament was controlled by the ruling Equatorial Guinea Democratic Party and its followers, while opposition politicians were banished, imprisoned, and killed. In 2003, state-run radio stations called him the "" God of the almighty nation, the God of the Undying Man and the eternal contract. "" They call themselves El Gefe and impose worship. He also claims his son, Teodoro Nguema Obiang, as his successor. Paul Biya (85) president is 35 years and has ruled. He also drove out his predecessor and established absolute power. However, it is a little different from the general pattern such as a coup d'état. Cameroon's first president, Ahmadou Ahidjo, independence, former Villa in power, while the long-term seizure of power after 82 years. He has set up Villa as the scarecrow to remain as the chairman of the ruling Cameroon National Democratic Movement (CNU) and to act as the regent. But when she came to power, Villa completely took control of the state by interfering, and the next year Amadu was charged with treason and deported. And he resigned himself to remain as president through a fraudulent election is little chance. The prevailing view is that we will not let go of power until we die. Still, he prepared a safety device for emergencies. He revised the constitution so that he can not be prosecuted after he retired. Denis Sassou-Nguesso (73) the president is 79 elected president after being laid off for a while and lost five years in power for 33 years, except in an election. It was possible because he had set his hands on the constitution not to lose power again. Congolese president running for office originally was limited to 70 years old. His term in office was limited to seven years. However, in 2015, he voted to pass the amendment bill and succeeded in his third year when he was re-elected at the age of 72 last year. Yoweri Museveni, which has ruled Uganda for 31 years (73) president has considerable influence in Africa, a man. He led the resistance forces against IdI Amin, the worst dictator who committed extreme human rights abuses before his rule, and achieved rapid growth by adopting the East Asian economic development model, including Korea, after taking office in 1986. He was once touted as the ‘ Big Man of Africa ’. But in the mid-2000s, he turned into an authoritarian leader. In July 2005, he passed a revision bill that erased the three-term rule by a formal referendum to open the way for him to power for life. The ruling camp has also begun to crack down on opposition parties. Foreign policy reports in 2006 that he secretly cleaned up the people of AcolI, a opposition group, by taking two million people to concentration camps. Last year, Museveni succeeded in line five. Recently, reports say, the ruling National Resistance Movement of Uganda (NRM) is pushing for a constitutional amendment to keep him in power for life. To amend the Constitutional provision that more than 75 years old can not run for president. Under the current rules, Museveni will be 77 years old by 2021 when the next presidential election is to take place, and she can not run for presidency. Their long run looks pretty much the same. The chairman has also kept his power through elections, although he has kept his own money and oppressed opponents by using his own money. Thanks to her heroic past, she maintained a moderate support rate and did not act extremely hard enough to incur a national resentment. Uganda's IdI Amin, who killed him for not being able to sell his grave enough to dump him into a river, and "" Blood Diamond, "" who killed hundreds of thousands of people and cut off their hands and feet from the people of Liberia. Mugabe and his current African dictators are relatively "" ordinary dictators, "" which means they have lasted for decades without inner challenges or constraints on the international community. However, reports of Chinese influence behind Zimbabwe's coup have forced "" ordinary dictators "" to feel a sense of crisis. According to Hong Kong's South China Morning Post (SCMP), General Chiwenga, the main figure in the coup, visited Beijing last week to meet with the Chinese People's Liberation Army headquarters. Although China said it was "" a normal military exchange, "" the SCMP said, "" China is suspected of being the first to know of Zimbabwe's coup. "" This implies that China may have engaged in regime change. China is the biggest investor in the construction of nuclear plant and supercomputers in Zimbabwe. Of course it has enormous influence, and this is true of other African countries. Such a situation would be uncomfortable for the West, including the United States, which has practically condoned the dictatorship in Africa. The United States, the World Bank's International Monetary Fund (IMF) and France, which ruled Africa under colonial rule, supported and supported the dictatorship with various forms of support. It is quite a headache for China, with authoritarian governments collapsing like Domino's and complicated calculations even when democratic governments are in place, to be welcomed. Zimbabwe's bloodless coup appears to end with Mugabe falling and the powers of what is nicknamed "" crocodiles "" - Mr. and Mrs. Mbangarg. There are many concerns about this. It is not a fundamental change, but it could lead to the birth of another dictator. The BBC reported that Zimbabwe was saying, "" Mugabe is bad, but could it be worse if he comes after that "".

"Have you heard of Pyeongchang Long padding? It is a cold-weather overcoat to celebrate Pyeongchang's Winter Olympics, and its popularity is skyrocketing these days. Hundreds of meters of lines had to be lined up from daybreak to buy the suit, and police were in a commotion in some stores. I'm reporter Seo Sang-hee. I can't see the end of the long line in front of the department store. Put on a thick coat and blanket, and ‘ fully armed ’ and bear the knife. [Lee Jae-seung / Goyang City, Kyung-gi] I came out at 4:30 a.m. "" You're still waiting. "" "" Today, when I heard that the Pyeongchang Olympics ' souvenir, ' Long padding, ' is being rolled out to the store, the mall was packed with people from dawn. [YunsuminDongdong-dong, Seoul] : "" I don't think it's worth the amnesty. My friend also asked me to "" Buy. "" "" It's not until the store opened yet. It's packed, hundreds of meters in rows, out of the box. "" After a long wait, the sale begins. It's selling out in a fraction of a second. Pyeongchang Long padding is made by adding 80 % of goose down and 20 % of the feather, but its limited price is 149,000 won, so it is popular. Online shopping malls sold out early on, and there were even postings saying used ones were damaged by fake sales. More people were buying in comparison to the supply, so the public was confused and police moved in to try to stop the fight over the item. This is Seo-sang-hee from Channel A news. ○ ` Thought-out channel of election pledges ` The incumbent president of the unprecedented impeachment and presidential election, rather than sharing a sense of responsibility are in the disaster, air flow to gakjjadosaeng He points out that widespread. It is also easy to say, Only professional politicians with four-year irregular workers can afford to overflow. Innovation is, clean-up of the pro-Park Geun-hye faction of the free Korea but ended up under the name of the trial of strength as much as a regular aspect. “Pro-Park is now automatic procedures to go to death.” said Hong Joon-pyo Korea is the last 17. The party of the pro-Park Geun-hye faction is crucial to Suh Chung-won, and Rep. Choi Kyoung-hwan of the suspended him for ‘from the pitch’ but has strongly opposed parties. In this situation, it is necessary to hold a general meeting to approve two-thirds or more of incumbent lawmakers. Hong should be careful because he can not rule out the expulsion of the team from the party by issuing a countermove. The pro-Chinese circles are waiting for the time to make a comeback, saying, After all, Hong will serve as chairman until next year's local elections at the earliest. However, Hong did not sit still whenever the pro-Park members tried to hit back. They used various media interviews and Facebook to compare their friends to cockroaches and beat them down with comments that they are "" making a fuss about it without a hitch. "" Why is Hong engaged in such a fight? The disgraceful expulsion of two key pro-Park members from the party provides little evidence that the GNP will gain support. However, it is clear that the pro-Park members ' position will be narrowed. A key pro-Park official said, We have had to form a structure to protect their interests if Hong raises the issue of leadership. Some analyze that Hong's decision was inevitable to gain control of the party by overcoming the limitations of being a party leader and not an incumbent National Assembly member. The problem of the lack of talent and leadership in the "" Herry family "" argument is that as their confrontation intensifies, the reform of the party is drifting. Some point out that if the pro-Park members proactively declared their sacrifice in the next general election, they would not have made such an ugly appearance. Meanwhile, Rep. Choi and Suh were reprimanded for the suspension of party membership for three years, but Hong was responsible for creating a stir by granting amnesty to get Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province (TK) votes during the election. Jeonghanul yeosijae candle designer is "" the ideal solution is party political situation not break the ruling party on its own reformist party leaders in and cede power.Was to have "" and "" The reality is the pro-Park Geun-hye faction is attacking them is bibak them busy, and, conservatives, is the president to take responsibility for themselves after the impeachment.Who got nothing. "" Throughout history, conservatives find a momentum for rebound with self-sacrificing and deep reflection in every crisis. Impeach Roh Moo-hyun, former president in 2004, when are all the rage against the wind is Park Geun-hye, the representative of The tent set up. For a while, he did not take any chances to rent and consistently stated, "" We're sorry. "" The company tried to restore its credibility by thoroughly reflecting on itself and taking the money back to the national treasury by selling its training center. As a result, his approval rating was restored in three months and he won the election in 2006, followed by the victory in the 2007 presidential election. Lee Myung-bak, former president's elder brother, 2010, when Rep. Lee Sang-deuk of sparking a dispute ‘brother's budget’ Choung Byoung-gug and Nam Kyung-pil, gimseyeon hwangyeongcheol junior Grand National Party members.22 have retained their seats and put the brakes. I will not give a show of hands when I try to vote on the National Assembly budget. "" When the presidential election was announced in 2011, lawmakers Won Hee-ryong, the third largest parliamentary aide in Seoul, announced that he would not run for office. Rep. Kim Hyung-oh, Hong Jung-wook, Chang Je-won, Hyun Ki-hwan, and Park Jin also joined the list. Voluntarily after is a major reshuffle of Park Geun-hye opposed changing regime could be presidential election to succeed in firmly tightened up in. Professor Kang Won-taek of Seoul National University said, "" The conservative camp currently has no sense of crisis in which it is possible to live only when we change, and it is still possible to appoint people as our own, "" adding, "" It is a time to question our leadership. "" Hey`s clear conservative integration and approval rating is showing the limits of the conservatives even in the right party integration with the Korea Party. The two geological shifts, which occurred just before the presidential election and seven months before the local elections, were not an extension but a zero sum game. The results of the rally were simply to be met or let loose by supporters of the conservative camp but failed to impress the general public. Hong told a news conference on July 17, I am the owner of the Korea Party house. We have already closed the door on the possibility of the departure of some members of the right party. We heard it was up to the owners to decide whether to close it or not. This is a direct indication of Hong's perception of conservative unity. The right party is also struggling to break the impasse over the party's concentration on backing away from the party, and therefore, it can not afford to show leadership to resolve the crisis among the conservatives. After the presidential election, the Korea Party has remained at the 10-percent level with the right party remaining single-digit in the polls. More than 20 percent of TK and older members of conservative parties say they do not support parties. "" A decline in support rates means that the people are not recognizing conservative as an alternative force. "" Chung said, adding, "" As a ruling party, if anyone asks for an election reform, we should be responsible for it and initiate such a reform. If things go like this, the conservative camp won`t be able to stay in power for more than a decade, he said, stressing, We should not just try to win the election, but concentrate on internal reform with a determination to lose.

"Commercial banks of the Getty Imagebank Bank have raised their loans while keeping interest rates on their deposits, the report said. The loan rate is going up in time for an increase. The gap between deposit and loan rates, or the chronic disease of banks that easily benefits from lending and deposit rates, is being repeated.According to the financial authorities, the difference between the Bank of Korea's average deposit rate and lending rate in the third quarter of this year was 2.06 percent, the biggest since the fourth quarter of 2014. The rate of the COFIX in October, the basis of mortgage rates at banks, was 1.62 percent, a 0.1 percent increase from the previous month. It is the highest level in one year and eight months. The increase is also the biggest in 11 months. The maximum interest rate on home equity loans by major commercial banks rose to 4.5 percent a year.Meanwhile, deposit rates are flat.

It is noticeable that the white areas of the peninsula have descended to the north.The cold snap in mid-November is stronger than usual. Seoul and Incheon had the third lowest temperatures on July 19, after 2008 and 1998. Busan is the second country to visit since 1979. Paju and Buyeo, Chungnam Province were even the coldest places to be observed. Changwon, Namhae, Yeongdeok, Gunsan, and Jecheon were also the second or third coldest regions on record following the years of 2007 and 2008. There are three main reasons why the winter cold earlier this year was earlier. First, the Arctic Karavarenz sea ice area is decreasing day by day. Ice reflects sunlight, but sea water absorbs sunlight. As the sea water heated up, the relatively warm temperatures caused a low pressure. The development of high pressure on the Arctic Ocean could reduce the winter high on the Korean Peninsula, which was not the case this year. As the climate changes get worse, this abnormal phenomenon is growing.Secondly, there was the "" cold wind highway "" that occurred in Siberia. It is also related to the Arctic Ocean's absorption of sunlight. The sea water was heated into steam and sprinkled with snow. It snowed more this year than usual.But cold winds were already blowing in this area. It is due to the high pressure on the continent. It snowed but the ground froze solid with the cold wind. "" Even when the continental high atmospheric pressure develops in Siberia, the cooling cools down when the peninsula is affected, but this year the roads were covered with snow and there were no obstacles, "" an official at the Korea Meteorological Administration said.That is not the only effect of the eye. The reflection of sunlight by the snow on the surface also has an effect on the cold. According to the satellite data of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the area covered in snow on July 1 and 15 is very different.Lastly, air flow was stagnant over the Korean Peninsula. Because of the Earth's rotation, the atmosphere moves from west to east. However, low pressure stays in place, sending cold air from Siberia and China down to the Korean Peninsula. If the airflow had not been shut down, the cyclone would have moved eastward, and it would not have consistently drawn cold air into the peninsula.It is not until the end of this month that the atmospheric conditions in the air are lifted and the low-pressure system moves to the east, an official at the Korea Meteorological Administration forecast. According to the Korea Meteorological Administration, it will cool down and rain on Wednesday. It gets cold again on Thursday and by the end of the week Tuesday, the cold was very strong, but temperatures are expected to pick up in the year starting late this month.< Song Yoon-kyung kyung@kyunghyang.com> Actor Kwon Hyuk-soo will give a lecture on fast food, imitating the famous Korean history instructor Seol Min-seok.▽ Pictures = Since teenagers who eat SN L capture meals usually use the language of ' fast food ' online, it is being used in real life. The opinion that the spread of fast food should be seen as the natural flow of the changing language environment, and the position that it is language breakdown is opposed to the idea. ◇ Food style, Internet language origin … As the education industry began communicating via instant messaging around 2015, electronic slang words used by B.J. or teenage slang words used in online communities began to appear. A fast food is made by connecting words with similar accent to a cabashI and using an initial consonant to communicate with it. But, the word ' evassebassI ', or ' hairtail ' is used to describe the word ' hairtail. ' The word "" Myeonggok "" is used to describe a song by exchanging similar consonants and vowels, and "" dangmungI "" is a popular sound used in baseball galleries.Conversation with initial consonants is the classic form of food. ' ㅇ? ' ' ㅇ ㅈ? ' is ' injeong ㄱ ?? ' (. ㅇ r ' ') is ' I real ( ' (jinjja geo).The feeder demanded consent to what she said, and then she said, ' Appreciation? ' And then she asked, ' Appreciation? ' And she asked, ' Persent? ' And she asked, "" assent. ◇ Natural Phenomenon due to Language Environment Changes … Many people see a level of teenage culture as a natural phenomenon due to the development of social networking services. Young people are inclined to tolerate fast food. Kim Se-ri (24), who works for a media company, said, "" I thought it was a trend, "" and "" If it's not a big moral problem, fast food is a bit of a culture in its own sense. "" If we don`t know how to eat fast, we can feel behind the trend, Kim added. Lee (24) said, "" Although I have an opinion that we are destroying Han-gul, I am using it as a modification because I am interested in it. "" ◇ There are a lot of food promagandists with negative means…Some people do not like SN Lcapturage-level foods. The word fast food itself begins with the word ‘ fast food ’, which is derogatory to teenagers, and is used to mean ' en, chimotI, ' or ' mother ' which comes from pornography. "" More than half of my 21 classmates used fast food in real life, "" said Kwon (15), in junior high school, adding, "" It makes me feel bad even at my age. ""`` It is okay to use it in a playful way sometimes while speaking in a friendly way, but when it comes to abuse, such as in an official capacity, I can frown, '' Park Young-jin (25) said. Shin (52), a housewife, said, I don`t understand what you are saying, and when I hear it, it makes me irritable, I don`t know why you are destroying a language with good ones. Using fast food is a natural phenomenon due to changes in the language environment and language breakdown, said Kim Hyung-joo, a professor at the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies at Sangmyung University. Professor Kim went on to say, "" We were concerned that we should use Han-gul not as a good idea of creative use but as a means of entertainment only, "" adding, "" It is not the recognition of radical consciousness that is needed to be implemented as an educational tool.

As for individual apartments, the price of Sinbanpo Hanshin 15-cha apartment in Seoul`s Seocho district rose by more than 600 million won last year, the biggest increase on the basis of prices. According to a survey conducted on real estate 114 on November 19, apartment prices in Sejong City rose by an average of 4.44 % as of November this year, and apartment prices in Sejong City rose by 11.17 % to top the rate. Apartment prices in Sejong City rose only by 2.13 percent last year, but this year, real estate measures in the 8-2 area were on a high rise until they were designated as speculation zones and speculation zones. The new administration has received a large number of favorable returns, including the addition of parliamentary members and government buildings.Apartment prices in Seoul rose 9.23 percent as of November, following Sejong City's bid for apartments to build apartments that had topped the list this year. As demand for apartments has soared in the reconstruction area and new apartments in the downtown area, the cumulative increase rate exceeded the growth rate of 7.57 percent last year.

Seongdong-gu saw the only double-digit rise of 10.08 %, with the only Gangnam area (8.69 %) and Yongsan (8.58 %) being followed by Seoul. Among them, the districts designated as speculation zones were all with the exception of Gwangjin-gu. Other areas besides Sejong and Seoul generally had no significant rises. Gyeonggi Province saw an average 2.63 percent rise, but it saw a sharp polarization between regions. Apartment prices in Seongnam (7.3 %) and Anyang (6.9 %) have risen significantly due to the strong influence of new towns in Bundang and Pyeongchon, and Hanam (6.7 %), which is home to Hanam, South Jeolla Province (6.4 %).

Fortune (- 0.05 %) and Ansung City (- 0.17 %) were weak. Busan, which posted the nation's highest rate of increase by 10.74 percent last year, only rose by 2.5 percent this year due to government regulations such as the designation of subscription areas. Daegu city saw its reconstruction work grow by 2.37 percent, followed by Incheon with 2.3 percent. The Gangwon Province saw a 1.58 percent rise due to the recent positive effect of the opening of the Pyeongchang Olympics special and the Seoul-Dongnung KTX. In contrast, Ulsan (- 0.58 %) and Chungnam (- 0.73 %) and North Chungcheong (- 1.32 %) and South Gyeongsang Province (- 1.54 %) saw their prices drop, respectively.Apartments in Gangnam, Seoul, saw their prices rise significantly, depending on individual complexes.

"Although fresh water is 2.5 % of global water supply, 69 % means 0.3 % higher than ice, lake and river water temperatures, concentrated increase in marine evaporation. As a result, frequent changes in the amount of storm, drought, and soil erosion can not occur due to the high volume of food imports. After life happened, life remained in the sea for about 3.3 billion years. Even though multicellular organisms came to land more than 470 million years ago, they were still linked to the water circulation that led to the sea and land. Land life organisms live on stable water. Amphibians that were first developed overland live both on land and water. Only the amniote that lays eggs with a moisture-proof shell was fully adapted to land. The human race then secured water by constructing irrigation systems, dams, and even structures called submergence. In order to identify the water available to humans, it is necessary to know the allocation of global water storage. If the Earth is the size of a basketball, all the water on the ground is the size of a ping pong ball. About 70 percent of the Earth is covered with water, but 97.5 percent of this water is unfilterable. Only 2.5 percent is fresh water, 68.9 percent of whom are trapped in glaciers and 30.9 percent in the ground. Only about 0.3 percent stay and flow in the lakes and rivers, respectively, and about 0.05 percent of them have air in them. Today, humans already use more than half of the available fresh water, which is about 0.01 percent of the global water. Hey`s reduced to five years of record torrential rain cycles, and the water moves by the minute. In other words, the clouds gather and diverge, the river flows, and the sea turns slowly. Water circulates continuously throughout the sky, land, and oceans. The return of vaporizing water from the sea to the sea takes about a week. Climate change causes water storage and circulation on a global scale. This can have a fatal effect on the water supply that enriches the ecosystem, causes crops to grow, and keeps civilization alive. Global warming increases the amount of rainfall due to increased ocean evaporation around the world, but the bigger effect is on the circulation of water between the atmosphere and the oceans. Because of this, the amount of regular rain is decreased and the intensity of torrential rain increases. Heavy rainfall results in larger discharge from rivers, decreasing the efficiency of storing and using water and increasing soil erosion in agricultural areas. On the other hand, the arid regions, where the air is falling, are drier and more likely to be drought areas. In the Special Report on Climate Change (IPCC), published in 2012, record concentrated rainfall and droughts occur once every 20 years are projected to occur every five years and every two to five years. In particular, changes in mountain glaciers and Asian monsoons can cause great pain for mankind. About 25 percent of the world's population gets water from mountain glaciers. Winter snow stays on glaciers and melts during the summer to make crops grow. Global warming melts mountain glaciers for short-term increases in water supply, but ends up causing them to lose their supply. Monsoon rains throughout Asia for about 100 days each year. The rain grows food to support half the world's population. Changing the intensity and position of the monsoon could potentially disrupt Asian food production that has remained stable. If the 20th century was an era of oil disputes, the 21st century would be an era of water disputes, the World Bank predicted. Oil can be replaced with renewable energy, but water is worse than anything else. Global demand for water is forecast to grow by 55 % in the next 14 years, but water resources can meet only about 60 % of the demand. A U.N. report released in 2015 warned that if the gap is not resolved, the world will face a greater water shortage. About one billion people around the world are in water shortages, the IPCC Special Report estimates. Lack of water increases the risk of conflict. Competition began in such a limited period of time that the word, ‘ rival ’ in English came from the word ‘ rivus, ’ meaning ‘ river ’. In the face of hunger and thirst, people do everything they can to survive. They are forced to fight or cross borders. It has already happened in Sudan and Syria where a drought has occurred recently. Now, let's take a look at the changes in water in our country. Rainfall has risen by about 19 per cent in the last 100 years. It is because of the increasing number of torrential rains during the summer. The 16 climate change prediction models, who participated in the IPCC fifth report, forecast that Korea`s precipitation rate would grow 7 to 13 percent over the next 100 years. Then, does the nation need not worry about water? A recent future water circulation study conducted by the National Institute of Meteorological Sciences predicted an increase in river discharge. This means that the available water resources effects are less effective and, in fact, more likely to flood as rainfall increases. On the other hand, the higher evaporation rates of the earth's surface temperatures make the soil on the ground drier, potentially causing greater damage to the field crops. In other words, rivers are expected to face opposite extremes with increased risk of flooding and increased risk of drought in rural areas. Korea is a country that lacks water, having a larger population even though the annual average rainfall is much higher than the global average. Still, the reason why we can not feel the water shortage seriously is because we import a large amount of food. Water that enters indirect into the production, distribution, consumption and disposal of agricultural and livestock products is not visible, but it travels throughout the world through food trades. The number of virtual machines that the nation has used abroad to produce food imports is more than twice that of domestic agricultural water. That means we are more dependent not only on our water but also water from other countries to avoid being hungry. The water crisis is likely to arise from water shortages in other countries and turn into ' hunger, not thirst '. Therefore, the nation should monitor and respond to the water supply where it imports food. If we don't respond to the risks first, they can come to us first. Hey International Institute for Demographic Behavior divided the water condition by country into water supply, water shortage, and water famine. This classification does not represent actual conditions, but is only calculated by rainfall, land area, and population. Israel, a water-hungry country, is an exporting country, but many African water-rich nations also suffer from water shortages. This is a typical example of how important water management is. In other words, if you are suffering from a water shortage, it is not the amount of water that is lacking but the management of the water. The World Bank analyzed the effects on the economy in 2050, in two cases, not responding at all to water shortages and performing an effective water policy. East Asia's GDP is forecast to decline 6 percent if it does not respond to water shortages. On the other hand, it was estimated that an efficient water policy would only increase GDP by 2 %. To cope with water shortages, policies should be implemented to optimize water use, expand water supply and reduce the effects of extreme weather conditions, the World Bank report said. Fresh water not only provides clean water, but it also serves as a cleaner who washes away all of the dirty things left by life and civilization and takes them to the sea through rivers. In the future, with the use of more water, more pollution will occur due to population growth and economic growth. In addition, due to global warming, the water temperature increases, resulting in the increase of algae and red tide. As water consumption and pollution rates grow faster, the speed gap is progressively larger as used in water cycles. Therefore, the demand for water and the quality of water should be controlled together. Water circulates and instills life into every system that life depends on. Water flow is not just a matter phenomenon. Humans have worshipped, loved, and feared water, connected to water, and conflicted about the water, among many sociocultural backgrounds. Now we are living in an era of climate change in which stable supplies of water and food are becoming increasingly threatened. So we connected through the water ecosystem on Earth and civilization can continue to think and act. Her Korea is the concept invented by Professor Alan of London University in the fifth largest country of steel imports used to produce the product. Virtual water means the product. For example, 1,500 liters of water, 3400 liters of rice, and 15,000 liters of beef per kilogram of beef are used to produce 1 kilogram of wheat. Multiply the number of imported agricultural and livestock products by the number of virtual machines and the amount of water imported from overseas. The ministry report showed agricultural imports averaged 28.8 billion tons per year between 1992 and 2007, an increase of 27.1 billion tons from 1.7 billion tons shipped abroad. That is more than 12.5 billion tons of agricultural water consumed here. Korea is the world`s fifth largest destination of virtual water, behind Japan, Italy, Britain and Germany. That is, our survival already depends on the water of other countries.

"Doctors at the hospital are conducting polysomnography tests for sleep disorder patients. I feel particularly hungry because I did not get enough sleep the day before Seoul Asan Hospital was provided. I could hear this in my mind, but I sent a late night snack and ate enough ice cream in the refrigerator for dessert. At this point, I want to say, ' Gosh! ' She felt a hunch to fall asleep as she was full, but could not sleep well due to the swelling of her stomach. However, I am afraid that I will have to sleep after waiting until my stomach is empty. Lee (30), an office worker, should have been troubled by something like this. Then, who would really be the main culprit in this problem?Last February, Dr. Erin Hanlon and her team at the University of Chicago's University of Medicine's Endocrine and Diabetic Studies Center announced a study that would help track down the criminal. In the experiment, participants were allowed to lie down on a bed for eight and a half hours every day for four days and only four and a half hours for the other four. Naturally, when the time spent in bed was limited to a short time, the sleep time was shortened. As a result, the number of foods consumed was higher in inverse proportion to the shorter sleep time. The researchers also found that the neurotransmitters 2 - AG, the neurotransmitters involved in satisfying an appetite when the participants were not able to sleep. "" Lack of sleep was a hunger trigger in the body, and therefore Dr. Gilty Fleasure's risk of eating too much with guilt grew. "" They say that the sleeping debt could be the main cause of hunger and greed that is not always left.■ Research shows that insufficient sleep can lead to an insatiable appetite for food, and in fact, lack of sleep can lead to obesity. In this regard, the results of the recently announced National Health and Nutrition Research (2016) by the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention are significant. The rate of obesity among men rose to 42.3 percent for the first time to 40 percent, while the rate of obesity among adults rose to 34.8 percent from 33.2 percent a year earlier. Among other chronic non-obesity illnesses, the rate of illnesses, particularly high blood pressure and hypercholesteremia, associated with lack of sleep also rose. High blood pressure patients aged 30 and over reached 29.1 percent, the highest rate in 10 years. High cholesterol rates and diabetes rates also rose by 2.0 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, to 19.9 percent and 11.3 percent, respectively. These metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, including obesity, are not only affected by sleep, but also influenced by diet and other factors such as physical activity. However, it is also difficult to deny the link with the long-term harm caused by sleep debt. According to a study conducted by Park Sang-min, a professor of medicine at Seoul National University, and a team of scientists at the medical school analyzed the correlation between sleep and obesity, the shorter the sleep time, the more body fat a person can gain. Nursing University professor Park Eun-ok, who studied the link between sleep time and hypertension, also noted that "" the amount of sleep time needed to be decreased over the past few decades "", and that over the same period, hypertension prevalence rates increased.The problem is that the debt of the sleep already accumulated could lead to a vicious cycle of creating more. As sleep is lacking, the blood levels of serotonin levels related to feeling content decrease, leading to the habit of smoking and eating too much alcohol. Serotonin levels temporarily elevated by binge eating are dropping so quickly, creating a vicious cycle of being again vulnerable to chronic stress. Sleep apnea, a typical symptoms of sleep disorders known to be high in overweight people, is also a high risk. Even though one is not overweight, one needs to take quick action if one's sleep debt builds up significantly and one suffers from sleep apnea. If you suffer from apnea that stops breathing after snoring heavily, you can feel tired no matter how long you sleep. In this case, the accumulation of sleep debt increases the cortisol hormone that responds to stress, resulting in a faster heart rate and higher blood pressure. And studies show that in the worst cases, these sleep disorders can shorten your life span. Last year, researchers from Korea University Hospital analyzed the chromosomes of 381 sleep-disordered patients, and found that the telomer, known as the body's aging clock, was shortened to the last known as the telomere.Problems remain even when you learn of the dangers of sleep debt. There is no way to deal with it immediately. The fact that sleep time has been shortened is partly due to individual habits, but also because of structural problems that are hard to ensure sufficient sleep. Given this reality, Sage Nessino, director of the Stanford Biorythrop Research Center (SCN) in the United States, introduced the concept of sleep debt as little as possible, but no, the best way possible was to create sleep. Studies by Major General Nishino and SCN show that the most effective way to relieve sleep pressure, including fatigue and stress, is during the first 90 minutes of sleep. Therefore, it is crucial to be able to get as much quality sleep as possible during this time period.■ If sleep debt is not easily detected and you want to induce sleep during the initial 90 minutes, it is necessary to control body temperature and reduce brain stimulation. Body temperature control points out that the difference between deep water temperature inside and the skin surface temperature is most likely to decrease, so you take a warm bath or a foot bath 90 minutes before bedtime and gradually keep yourself awake. Avoid the situations and stress that stimulate the brain in itself is nothing new. They say that the boring books and the repetition of simple numbers makes them feel sleepy.In general, watching a smartphone or TV even on a bed is known to interfere with quality sleep. However, there are other methods to induce sleep more aggressively using smart devices. Most notably, Napolix, a nap plics service modeled after popular video content provider Netflix. Of the video clips on YouTube, only images that maximize boredom are gathered there. It is a heat stroke for those who can not get their smartphones out of their hands and lead to insomnia and sleep debt. The site is filled with images that look even remotely boring, including a classic sleeping method of the Two-Century, a slow-slowing video of Japan's tea ceremony. "" The effect of the blue light on the smartphone itself is likely to be that it stimulates the brain, "" Nishino said, seemingly pointing out the effect that the blue light in the smartphone itself is likely to stimulate the brain.If the level of sleep disorder has reached a higher level due to heavy sleep debt, it is urgent to see the doctor as soon as possible. Cause of sleep disorder various external causes such as irregular work hours and lifestyle to extreme stress, overwork, or anxiety, so it is necessary to identify cause first. Experts especially warn against taking sleeping pills or taking them randomly without an exact diagnosis. Lee Hyang-un, head of the sleep center at Ewha Womans University Mok-dong Hospital said, Sleep disorder can lead to complications related to medical and neurological diseases, such as dementia and strokes, and had important medical and psychiatric services, and otology departments.< journalist Kim Tae-hoon anarq@kyunghyang.com> ▶ Popularity newspaper [Twitter] [View popular free cartoons] ■ Kyunghyang newspaper (www.khan.co.kr), prohibited by illegally copying and distributing"
"Seoul Housing Price Based on Median Price : Seoul Housing Price : KRW 435 million in Tokyo takes 9.2 years to get housing for Seoul. It took three to five years to get a middle-priced house compared to New York, Japan, and Tokyo. According to a report commissioned by Park Kwang-on, a fisherman's representative at the National Assembly Planning and Finance Committee on July 19, the median home price in Seoul was the highest as of late last year at 435 million won. Housing median price means the sale price of a house in the middle, when the prices of a house are ranked in order. The median price of apartments in Seoul was 133.36 million won, higher than that in Tokyo (as of November 15) and in Osaka (as of November 15) (as of August 138.8 million won). It was similar to Washington (438.3 million won), New York (444.4 million won), and Hong Kong (478.6 million won) and London (647.3 million won). If urban households with non-farming incomes (42.28 million won) are to be used by two or more people, they need to save 9.2 years without spending a single penny in income before they can afford their homes in Seoul. It is three to five years longer than Tokyo, Singapore, and New York. Families living in Tokyo, Japan, could afford medium-priced housing when they accumulated income in 4.7 years, 4.8 in Singapore, and 5.7 in New York, the United States. The median price of a nationwide home was 228.3 million won. The median price of a house in Seoul is 1.9 times higher than the national average. The runner-up was in the race at 253.9 million won. The gap between the first and second places stood at 177 million won. The third place was Sejong, with 227.55 million won and the fourth place was Daegu with 217.3 million won. Ulsan ranked 5th through 7th was ranked as the fifth largest city (215 million won), Busan (192.12 million won), and Incheon (188.5 million won), respectively. Jeonnam (73.31 million won) was the lowest price point for a home in the nation.

Article, report, inquiry, and investigation results are coming outA strong earthquake is threatening to occur frequently in the tropical regions with more than 1 billion people. The British daily Guardian reported on July 18 that Roger Bilham, the Columbia University, and Rebecca Bendick of the University of Montana presented the results of their studies at an annual meeting last month. According to the researchers, the Earth's orbital speed can change to about one-thousandth of a second per day, measured by an atomic clock. The researchers analyzed earthquakes with a magnitude of seven or more that occurred after 1900 to see how they affect earthquakes. As a result, they found five more earthquakes than ever before, with 25 to 30 earthquakes worldwide per year. Other times, the average of strong earthquakes was 15 times per year.Researchers also discovered that the Earth's rotation is frequently slowed down slightly and that it slows down several times in approximately five years. The researchers argued that since the Earth's rotation rate has slowed four years earlier and there have been six strong earthquakes so far this year, more than 20 more severe earthquakes are feared next year. It also analyzed that although the exact point of occurrence is not predicted, major earthquakes occurred in tropical regions where more than 1 billion people live due to the slowdown in the Earth's rotation. The researchers speculated that the subtle changes in the activity of the Earth's nuclear program could affect both the speed of the rotation and the earthquake, although it is not clear why the Earth's rotational speed would increase further. youngkyu@yna.co.kr ▶ Report and inquiry (click!) ▶ Starbucks Coffee Subsidy for 400 Minutes Yonhap news channel chaeneol00 Generation Earthquake Design Class 1 of Jangnyang-dong 800 Seisong...The exterior wall of an apartment building in Pohang has an earthquake. Pohang : A 800-generation apartment building built by a famous Pohang construction company in Jangryang-dong, Pohang City, North Gyeongsang Province, has a sharp crack on the outer wall with an "" X "" on each floor after the Pohang earthquake on July 15. Although the apartments were built three years after they were first designed, cracks were found in five out of nine apartments on the 20th floor. The interior is worse. No one has full marble tiles at the entrance to the front floor. Some lines still need to be used to cross stairs due to the twisted elevator, not to mention cracks in the wall. There are cracks in the front door of each generation, including stairs and emergency exit. At the urgent meeting on the earthquake disaster response, which was held at the multi-purpose room of apartment building at 7:00 p.m. on July 17, residents burst out into an angry castle. Apartment builders said, Rather, they believe the apartments were located close to the quake's epicenter, could not have been determined by waveforms, but if the quake waves had a direct impact on the apartment building, they were able to deal with the impact of non-crack cracks. The wall inside an apartment building in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, is cracked by an earthquake. Pohang : Kim Jeong-hye, a reporter at Apartment.com, says, "" Apartment residents are reluctant to take the explanation into their confidence. Thousands of apartments are located near apartments, but this is the only place with severe cracks on exterior walls. About 80 percent of the five cracked children were reportedly left homeless due to anxiety.In return, the residents even set up an emergency committee with construction experts as technical advisors, and are busy preparing countermeasures.However, the residents did not report the damages to Pohang and did not let the outside world know anything about it. Fears are growing that the disclosure of the damaged buildings could affect the already falling housing prices. As of the end of October, the number of unsold apartments in Pohang was 2,239, which is already included in the unsold apartments of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. "" I'm afraid I wake up dozens of times every night because I'm going to sleep out, "" said a 36-year-old resident of a T apartment. "" I can't tell you when I'm feeling nervous about home. """" I've never seen an apartment house built three years ago fractured like this on an outside wall in an earthquake, "" said a civil engineer in Pohang who explained to me, "" I'm not sure what the situation was like with the construction company. ""An apartment in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, is banning the use of elevators damaged by earthquakes. Pohang : In addition to the Hankookilbo.co mT apartments, residents in Jangryang-dong, Duho-dong, and U-chang-dong in Buk-gu, Pohang can not use elevator cracks due to their instability.

"○ … People say, "" I'm out with my daughter. I want to go to North Korea to find her body. "" "" She's dead, my wife is missing, my daughter is in jail, and a 60 year old woman who's in charge of abandonment. "" Police sent to the villagers to identify the deceased. She was 83, living in a town in Gapyeong-gun, 20 kilometers from the river. Police asked the National Institute of Scientific Investigation to carry out an autopsy to determine the cause of his death. No major trauma was found in his body and death was declared drowning. A photo of the data from the Gapyong-Bukhangang River [Central Photo] was questioned by police to bring the body to the scene when he died in an accident. And I contacted A's daughter B (43) on July 15. `` Dad is right, '' B said. `` Father and mother went out holding hands together. '' However, something strange was discovered. A few days after his parents went away and lost contact with him, he did not even report his disappearance. I was not surprised at the news of my father's death. Police formed an investigation team to find C (77), the wife of an unidentified man and mother of a B. And examined Mr B in secret. Then a surprising fact was discovered. Police checked CCTV installed around A's house and found that the couple, who had been "" holding hands together, "" will have seen their homes covered at 7:20 p.m. and 9:40 p.m. on July 11. The CCTV showed the couple being carried on a bongo car with their daughter and others on it. After confirming the lie, police tracked the figure in the bongo car. Mr. D (63, female) was in the car with Mr. B. Police officer Line. A daughter who took her parents ashore and a woman in her 60s were immediately arrested by police. The woman in her 60s was known to lead a religious group. Police in Gapyeong, Gyeonggi Province, requested an arrest warrant for each of them Thursday on charges of dumping B for maintaining his employment. They are accused of attempting to bring father A and mother C of blood to Bukhangang Bridge on July 11. "" My father said to the police, ' Get me out of a beautiful, air, and quiet place, ' and my mother said, ' Get me out of the same place as my father, ' so I gave him a lift. "" They usually said they wanted to go to heaven, and then asked Mr. B to help them and put them in cars. According to police, he lived in the U.S. for 30 years and came to Korea about three years ago. He has lived in a house in Gapyeong-gun since October 2016. B, who is single, was an English teacher here but quit a month ago, saying, It is hard to work at an institute. B is believed to be a member of a religious group led by D, police said. Mr. D is said to have served as a pastor of a former Christian sect. "" It is not a teaching or a church building, but a religion where like-minded people gather to chat and pray over tea, "" police officials explained. The congregation also referred to the teacher, not the leader, police said. The size of the house is 214.5 ㎡ (65 pyeong), a four-roomed house for police Mark. Other than the couple of "" A "" and their daughter, "" B "" were also living in the same family. Police believe the two are also members of religious groups led by D. But they do not say anything about the police investigation. It is known that D often visited A's house to see B and them. Police are currently searching the riverside area of North Korea to find the mother of the missing man, B. However, the couple has no cellular phone, so the investigation is in trouble. "" Mr. B and Mr. D have since refused to comment. They're still holding no silence, and it's been confirmed that Mr. C and the others are having a hard time investigating, "" a police officer said. Meanwhile, the investigation into the arrest warrants for B and D was conducted at the Uijeongbu District Court on the morning of that day. Whether to issue an arrest warrant will be decided this afternoon.

"Bulla, Karen, and Minnie …, displayed at the American Zoo, have elephants at the Carmerford Zoo with visitors on their back. Animal rights advocates have filed a suit calling for the freedom of zoo elephants, not those provided by the International (ADI). The U.S. animal rights group Nonhuman Right Project released a press release on July 13 and said, "" We have filed a petition with the U.S. High Court in Connecticut to stop the arrest of zoo elephants. "" The person to whom the inhumane rights projects filed a lawsuit is the Carmerford Zoo in Connecticut, the United States. The group asked for the release of three elephants, Bula, Karen and Minnie, at the Cummerford Zoo. The habeas claim to allow a court to release a suit from custody when held for no reason, but a U.S. court has never applied it to an animal. The petition states that "" all elephants, including the three, are thought to have intellectual, emotional and social abilities enough to be guaranteed basic rights. "" The group also added that the three elephants must be freed from captivity and sent to their home in Ar akeu000, a wild elephant shelter in California, the United States. All of the elephants were born in nature and were imported into the zoo more than 30 years ago. Elephants are also currently being used commercially in and out of zoos, including circus, advertisement, musical or zoo spectators. The Non-human Rights Project said, "" Cummerford zoos have been recalled more than 50 times by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in violation of the minimum standards of animal welfare laws in the past. "" Among the violations, the elephant's contents are the one without the keeper's protection when contacting an elephant, the one without proper medical care, and transportation to an elephant's head. U.S. broadcaster NBC said, We asked Commerford to cover the incident, but there was no response from the zoo. An orangutan, "" Boram "" at the Seoul Grand Park, Gwacheon, is standing in front of a mirror and gazing into its own image. It is not the first time that the Personal-Personnel Rights Project of Gwacheon / Kang Jae-hoon has filed a lawsuit to guarantee basic animal rights. In 2013, the Non-human Rights Project of New York City issued a paper titled ' Tommy ', a former actor who was a captive chimpanzee confined to a trailer shop in New York, and a chimpanzee whose hearing loss was due to abusive language training at the ' Kiko University, ' and a chimpanzee whose hearing was deaf in the New York. Hercules and Leo returned to their original home town of New Iberia in December of that year, following an official report from Stony Brooks campus in July 2015, "" We won't use them for experiments. "" In June of this year, the New York State District Court rejected the appeal, saying "" We can not grant chimpanzees basic legal rights. "" The Non-human Rights Project filed an appeal on Tuesday against Tommy and Kiko. The Non-human Rights Project is an animal organization that claims the freedom of the human body stipulated in the U.S. Constitution, not limited to animals. Non-human human body means an animal that is not human, but has personality, attitude, and self esteem characteristics of human beings.

Blue hole was able to host the 2017 Ground Asia Invitational Championship, which recognizes Asia's strongest competitor with a total of 300 million won ($ 300 million) in prize money starting on July 7, and the day before yesterday, visitors could directly participate in the event. It was so hard to get many spectators to see the game in front of the blue hole battle ground booth. In addition to blue holes, Gistar's Premier sponsor, Actoz Soft collected thousands of spectators on the opening day of the ' WE GL Final, ' led by Starcraft : Limaster, Overwatch and Harston. The World Cup finals, which will be worth about 447.7 million won, will have a total of 120 participants from 12 countries including South Korea, the United States, France, Poland, Sweden, China and Australia. Unlike last year, when various PC online games were focused on mobile games, Gistar is also known for its outstanding balance between mobile games and PC online games. Blue Hole is the first to feature PC Gaming Back-up, MultI-Access Game (MMORPG). Nexon has gathered tens of thousands of viewers in the first place, with its PC and mobile games "" Over Heat, "" including the online soccer game FIFA Online 4. Netmarble unveiled four new mobile MMORPG (Terra M, Se7en Knights).Visitors at Nexon booth showed a decline in overseas participation, but due to the growing interest, Zistar's overseas participation this year was 151, down from last year's 166 articles from 35 countries. However, the interest of foreign media and businesses participating in the project has never been more intense. Netmarble officials said the popularity of Lineage II Revolution made many interviews call for overseas media this year, and asked the local release of a new game from Japanese, Taiwanese, and North American celebrities. At the B2B building, embassies and the Korea International Trade and Investment Administration have set up booths to advertise their games and attract investment from Korean game makers. We have been wanting to open booths at the Jistar Embassy for the past five years, and with an increase in Canadian companies ` partnership each year, seven Korean players are also playing high, said an embassy official. Foreign players ' interest in the Korean game industry was also keen. Pete Ford, the developer of his own 3D avatar game in Canada, unveiled his first booth this year, as he felt Zistar was right for him. An Indonesian game company said, "" I love Battlegrounds, but I have been able to see the development of Korean games with many people watching e-Sports in Gistar.

"Lee Dae-lee : On the evening of June 13, a North Korean soldier defected to the South Korean military from the central front of the province. After guarding GP, our soldiers secured recruits of the North Korean army who had crossed over to the south and safely handed them over to the G.O.P. In a joint investigation, he stated that the military loudspeaker team members had affected the decision to defect.Then, on the night of June 23, a North Korean soldier crossed the Military Demarcation Line via the Central Front in the Gangwon-do region. The investigation revealed the North Korean soldier was a 17-year-old trainee, fresh from the military. He reportedly decided to defect as he had a longing to see Korean society through dramas and movies. Prior to this, a North Korean soldier crossed the MDL line through the Central Military Front in September 2016 and defected to South Korea. In June 2015, a top 10 North Korean soldiers crossed the MDL from the front of the Chinese border. At that time, the soldier was found to have stayed overnight near the South Korean GP before he defected from the South, sparking a controversy over the South Korean military's vigilance.Since 2010, there have been around 10 North Korean soldiers who have defected from the country via the MDL. North Korean civilians often defect to the Northern Limit Line (NLL) in the West Sea. In August, one of North Korean men in his 20s again defected via the West Sea's Gyodong Island. As North Korean soldiers have defected, the issue of military discipline has become a hot topic. If there is a defection from the frontline, the North Korean military will take steps to prevent recurrences, including enhancing security. But the reason why the North Korean army crossed over to the South in 10 days like this summer is that there was a problem with the North Korean military system. In addition, the latest incident was to defect via the Joint Security Area (JSA). While North Korean troops have defected to the neighboring areas of the truce village of Panmunjeom several times, it is not very long ago that they have defected to the DMZ. It's the first time since 1998 and 2007. In February 1998, the top Byun Yong Gwan from the North Korean Army Guard Unit covering the Panmunjeom was brought to us through North Korea via the Guard Post, located next to the North's Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission accommodation. The North Korean military rank is the rank of officer between the first lieutenant and the second of our armed forces. Back in 2007, a North Korean soldier defected via the JSA, which was not made public. Military police in the Joint Security Area are watching North Korea. The blue building is the UNSC's neutral country surveillance committee meeting area, which is located in the middle of the Military Demarcation Line. The JSA has low concrete ' jaws ' without lines or structures marking MDL. [Provided by CFC] ◇ Joint Security Area, which is about 800m east to west and about 400m north and south of the truce village of Panmunjeom, has no bars or mines. The low "" jaw "", made of concrete, is all it takes to mark MDL. It is easier to defect than to other areas that need to pass along iron fences or mines because it is the south when you take one step or more.As a result, the Panmunjeom region is staffed and deployed by loyal elites from North Korea. That is why the military authorities believe that the defection from the DMZ is different from that of other areas. On July 13, a North Korean soldier who defected via the Joint Security Area drove a jeep with soldiers to get to the concrete jaw. This means that he belongs to the representative office of the Panmunjeom or to the unit that is aware of the topography. He rushed around the North Korean checkpoint and ran recklessly south after the tires fell into a ditch. Three North Korean soldiers and a soldier at a North Korean guard post fired at him about 40 times. As a result, about five of the soldiers were shot and taken to the Ajou University Hospital trauma center The doctors say they have had two surgeries so far, but they need to keep an eye on the situation because of their serious condition. ◇ Military rules of engagement and the effectiveness of the ceasefire agreement, his defection has caused a stir. First of all, the North Korean military fired 40 rounds at the South from the JSA, which did not respond to this or fire. As a result, the rules of engagement at the United Nations Command's Joint Security Area (JSA), which is under the control of the U.N. Command after the armistice agreement, are on fire. According to the rules of engagement at the Joint Security Area, a self defense fire is carried out based on the principle of necessity, extemporaneousness and proportionality. In the event of an emergency, the rules of engagement of Korean troops shall not be followed, as reported after taking action based on the judgment of the site commander. The rules of engagement with the ROK armed forces at the forefront can be punished three to four times more depending on the North's level of provocation, without regard to the principle of proportionality. Professor Lee Guk-jong of the North Korean Army gives a briefing on the results of surgery and patient condition of the shot North Korean soldier at Aju University Hospital in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province yesterday. At the same time, the Yonhap news agency said, "" We don't have a proper response to North Korea's violation of the armistice agreement. An AK-47 assault rifle has been found not allowed in the JSA on the body of the exiled soldier. There is a possibility of a breach of the ceasefire agreement, which permits the possession of only the pistol. In addition, CCTV footage of North Korean troops crossing the MDL during the defection secured by the UNC showed that some of the North Korean troops were attacked by the North. If confirmed as true, it is also a breach of ceasefire. But even the UNC Military Armistice Commission has concluded that the North's breach of the ceasefire agreement is all it can do is to issue a warning via a loudspeaker. The UNC's response is also controversial. The UNC plans to publish the 26-second footage of the defection to the media Monday. But when a Defense Department staff member raised an objection over the amount and content, it suddenly changed its stance. The statement is aimed at keeping the results of the military committee's investigation. We will not create unnecessary controversy, but there is a growing suspicion of concealment. There is also talk of human rights violations by the soldiers who have defected. Rep. Kim Jong-dae of the National Defense Commission at Seoul National Assembly said, The defectors were also attacked by the disclosure of parasites, internal waste, and even fake corn while being treated in the South. He also raised suspicion, saying, "" The operating room is a sacred place for doctors who can not enter their families, but who were the military intelligence agents who entered the room during the defection? "" It is a criminal offence under the current medical law.Kim Kwan-yong, ▶ (kky1441@edaily.co.kr) Naver ‘edaily’ in the channel subscription, please. ▶ '8 sting. - notes gael' of the event of ▶ katok peulchin, Starbucks.Coupon or ♥ < © 5 Kits combine a comprehensive financial information media edaily - illegal war damage and redistribution from 【 Newsis and Donald Trump, an American president (local time) White House on July 15,. / Washington : ap >After speech at a reception room for Foreign Affairs and personnel. 【 the John Lee Ji Ye reporters are in the United States of Seoul, United States :, 2017.11.16 haiteun strategic nuclear strike that are believed to be illegal (local time) Donald Trump the president on July 18th, commander.Rejection if to tell.

"Will the Middle East's media report ` Prince's B ` be legitimate next week? Will it take away the state's anti-capitalization fund management, half population, half youth support, and other funds from the Middle East's national security organization, by arresting and utilizing the funds to finance the execution of the state's anti-capital fund creation? Saudi Arabian Prince Muhammad Bin Salman is reportedly planning to take over the throne from the late King Falman Abdul Aziz al-SaudI (81) this week. `` King Salman will resign and surrender his official power to the Crown Prince, '' the Daily Mail quoted a royal source as saying. King Salman, who rose to the throne in January 2015, was seen as suffering from dementia and in June tore down his niece, Prince Muhammad Bin Nayef. It is possible that the two presidents will face a swift war five months after naming their son Bin-sal to the post. Bill-Salman, 32, is a screenwriter, director and main character in the recent Middle East situations. He began fighting the Iranian supported Hutian rebels in Yemen in 2015, when he served as the secretary of defense. The war has become a humanitarian controversy, with many saying that it failed to reduce the rebel forces and resulted in civilian casualties. He also led a campaign to block Qatar with Sunni Arab states. Hundreds of members of royal family, major businesses and high-ranking government officials were arrested on July 4 in an attempt to fight corruption. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who announced his abrupt resignation from the Saudi capital of Riyadh, also pointed out that empty lives are behind it. 18 (local time) Prime Minister Hariri, Emmanuel and Mark Long after meeting with president repeatedly said he wanted to return Lebanon to France but are unsolved and in the Middle East tension.to exist Analysts say that a series of events were born in the process of creating a smooth succession between the rich and the poor to the throne after the Salman wealthy stopped handing over the throne to their brothers, the basis of Saudi control. Saudi is suffering from a ' curse of petroleum resources '. The abundant fossil fuels have paradoxically held up the economy. The oil sector accounts for approximately 87 percent of Saudi budget imports, 90 percent of exports and 42 percent of GDP. However, Saudi Arabia's per capita GDP growth was only half that of natural resourceless Israel between 1950 and 2006. As the country exported abundant oil to other countries since its founding in 1932, human resources development was sluggish. Saudi youth unemployment stood at nearly 30 percent last year, as most of the economy depended on foreign labor. Worse yet, as oil prices have fallen in recent years, the Saudi government's financial deficit last year is estimated to reach 300 billion U.S. dollars. Failure to present a solution to this can compromise the position of being an empty man. If the people lose their support for her reform, which has already kept her distance from the royal family and conservative religious figures, her reform will lose steam. To this end, bin Salman launched the ' Vision 2030. ' This is a story about diversifying its oil-dependent economic structure and increasing the contribution of private companies, which currently account for 40 percent of the total oil consumption to 65 percent. It also announced a project to build a futuristic new town, Neom, 44 times the width of Seoul in the desert and mountainous areas near the Red Sea in the northwest. It costs about 500 billion dollars (approximately 550 trillion won) per year. The city is supplied with wind and solar energy instead of oil. However, the Saudi government can not afford to pay its investment funds. The deficit is equivalent to 17 % of GDP. It is not easy to reduce the subsidy that the government has provided to the people. Prince Bin Salman has asked for help from the royal family members who hold the purse strings. However, the majority said it was a dream, as they said, referring to the construction of Neohm. Rather, it has been discovered that they are moving their assets abroad. The Financial Times reported that the only people who have survived are the people who arrested the royal family members and businessmen on corruption charges and are negotiating the release with them to give up much of their wealth. The Saudi royal family, who are detained at the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton Hotel, says they have ' asset disclosure. ' The Saudi royal house says, ' Bargain of riches ' and ' maximum $ 300 billion in assets ' in financial aid, and the Arab equivalent of ' Prince Charles ' Tallal, request is 20 trillion won in assets. Earlier, the Saudi Prosecutor-General of the Prosecutors ' Office announced that the amount of corruption of the detained amounts to at least $ 100 billion (about 109 trillion won). We may be able to secure up to $ 300 billion through the fight, a government official said. The Riyadh Ritz-Carlton Hotel, the ticket office for the project, has turned into a royal police station for the sake of checks out and forced tax payment. The unrest in Saudi Arabia, one of the Middle East's order, has led to a sudden rise in international oil prices. This is probably not about the number of elderly people with empty pockets. To carry out Vision 2030, Vienna is expected to bring state-run Aramco on the stock market next year along with Saudi Arabia and the International Stock Exchange, and sell up to 5 percent of its shares. Higher oil prices are essential to sell Aramco at the highest cost for an empty house. British prime minister Terrisa May met with King Salman in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia last April. Citing the merits of the London Stock Exchange, May encouraged King Salman to go public on the Aramco London Stock Exchange. [AP = Yonhap news] Currently oil prices are traded at the highest level in three years. According to the FT, financial experts expect oil prices to rise further by the first half of next year. Some expect that as the only people who are living on empty land agree to cut production taxes with other oil producers, they will try to maintain high oil prices. Vienna has even declared a shift to the moderate Islamic line, allowing women to drive. The Saudi Arabian female economic participation rate is 20.1 percent, an attempt to change the situation in which Saudi women are ranked at 174-place among 188 countries. Ford's advertising to Saudi Arabia, where women are allowed to drive.`` Former Egyptian human rights minister Hull is concerned about the radical move, but the empty reforms have raised concerns for the United States and the West, too.

"Two U.S. soldiers fly over the Japanese helicopter carrier Ise and the U.S. carrier Theodore Roosevelt.China regards the Opium War (1840 - 1842) as the most disgraceful incident in history. The Opium War broke out when the Qing Dynasty confiscated opium to prevent the outflow of opium and silver from the British Empire. At that time, the British Empire sent a large navy vessel to the island to fight the Qing Dynasty, under the pretext of protecting its merchant vessels. The British empire deployed 44 warships, including the world`s first all-iron warship Nemessis. At the time, Nemesis was the most capable warship to carry 120 guns and run by steam engines. Because of this, wooden sailboats in Qing Dynasty could not match each other, so they rushed to run when the nemesis appeared. The Qing Dynasty accepted the unilateral request of the British Empire through the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842. In addition to fully rewarding the confiscated opium and war funds, Qing China not only compensated Hong Kong Island, opened four ports, and admitted extraterritoriality of the port of entry. Until World War II, warships armed with large warships were a symbol of national power and a terror target for enemies. The warship era ended when the world's largest MusashI ship sank after an attack by U.S. fighters, which was the largest in the world with a load of 76,195 tons during the Battle of Leyteman in 1944. ▽ U.S. aircraft carrier : The overwhelming firepower and power of warships is being replaced by aircraft carriers throughout the middle-middle-nation and air force. Nuclear aircraft carriers in particular can carry out long operations without refueling, and can carry more aircraft and bombs with minimum storage. It was the United States that first launched nuclear aircraft carriers. The United States has operated the diesel and nuclear carriers together since 1961, and since 2013, it has only had 11 nuclear carriers. The U.S. aircraft carrier is not only moving one. One assault strike shear moves around the carrier. The leaflet consists of flagship carrier, two to three Aegis cruisers (9600 t class), two to three Aegis destroyers (9200 t class) and two to three nuclear submarines. The power of one carrier is equivalent to that of most small and medium-sized countries. That is why the United States is considered the nation with the world's best military power. The U.S. carrier leaflet is used not only as a forerunner of the war but also as a means of ' inclusive diplomacy '. Included diplomacy refers to a diplomatic means by which the disputed parties send their ships to their respective countries to pressure them to fulfill their demands. The United States on November 11 to 14, Ronald reigeonham donghae to the carrier the leading edge of the assault three, led by Theodore, ruseubelteuam nimicheuam to joint training for. U.S. aircraft carrier three leaflets from 11th to 12th, morning, with Japanese waters off the East Sea from Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force helicopter carrier, Ise, destroyer of Inazuma and Markie Nami, with three.Joint training exercises each other. The afternoon of July 12 to the 14th donghae Korean operations conducted joint exercises with South Korean navy ship in zones (kto). The Korean navy mobilized seven ships during the training, including two Aegis destroyers such as Sejongdae the Great. It is the first time since the Chang-gun military launched joint training exercises with the three U.S. aircraft carriers. KTO is an area where the CFC commander declares it on the Korean Peninsula for smooth military operations in case of an emergency, including not only the territorial waters but also the pollution. The two countries carried out the carrier-controlled operations, anti-air fire drills, naval surveillance, naval supply, and fighter jets. In a report by The Wall Street Journal, the newspaper said 26 fighter jets were forced to make three sorties a minute via four catterports, and fighter jets were ordered to arrive within minutes. The paper analyzed, "" To win the war against North Korea quickly, air power is important, "" adding, "" This training seems to have focused on checking the ability of fighter jets. "" The three U.S. aircraft carriers have literally enormous power. The carriers are about 330 meters wide, 70 meters wide, and have a displacement of 100,000 to 110,000 tons. Each carrier is equipped with 70 to 80 aircraft, including the FA-18 Super Hornet Fighter, the E-3C Hawk Eye Air Early Warning Device, EA-18G Growler Electronics, and helicopters. Together, the three carrier leaflets are about 240 aircraft. The Aegis cruisers are capable of responding to a total of 24 targets at once and are equipped with Tomahok cruise missiles with a maximum range of 2,500 kilometers. The Aegis destroyer is also armed with Tomahok cruise and SM-3 anti-air missile. The Los Angeles-class nuclear submarine has 12 Tomahok cruise missile launch officials. There are about 300 Tomahok cruise missiles that one carrier can fire at. If three carrier leaflets attack Pyongyang with 1000 Tomahok cruise missiles, it is certain that they will collapse immediately. The three carrier leaflets cost 42 billion dollars (about 46.76 trillion won), larger than the Korean defense budget of 40 trillion won ($ 40 billion). The three carrier leaflets are the biggest pressure on North Korea since its nuclear crisis. The U.S. Navy fighter is taking off from the Ronald Raghan ship.The Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Agency has been deploying three or more anti-IsraelI attacks, the invasion of Iraq (2003), and the conflict between Iran and Iran (2012). The U.S. deployed three commercial aircraft carriers in the 1968 abduction of the Pueblo, North Korea, and the 1976 abduction of the DMZ axe by North Korea. At that time, the two incidents raised the crisis to the brink of war. In this context, the United States can say it is mindful of the war in the present situation, which is accompanied by North Korea's nuclear and missile threats. In fact, Donald Trump, American president is November 8 in Korean National Assembly speech “Don't test us” and “and the three aircraft carriers in the Korean peninsula.” high.Warned North Korea. Trump also stresses that it would “can not tolerate rogue regime that threatens the world to nuclear destruction.”, and it's “the peace by force.” president. Trump, lukewarm on sanctions against North Korea for China as well as a kind of president is North Korea show of force that they've dropped the analysis. In other words, it is a ' card-like diplomacy '. East Sea of the three carrier strike group in the United States deployed Cuban Missle Crisis in 1962 when a naval blockade as a strategy of the denationalisation can see. A naval blockade against North Korea, which completely blocks transactions via ship, is the final option of imposing sanctions on the North. A naval blockade is a military option that does not include a physical blow, but is the strongest tool to force North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programs. Of course, the United States is also preparing for military options. U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff David Goldpain recently announced that the three strategic bombers, B-1b, B-52H, and B-2, will be rotated regularly at Anderson Air Force Base in Guam. The U.S. Air Force on October 20 released an unusual GBU-57MOP bunker release video from the B-2. The 14-ton bomb can enter 60 meters underground and destroy bunkers and military installations. ‘a peace force’ the former president of Ronald Reagan, who insisted on aircraft after Trump was performing in the vanguard in the gunboat diplomacy strategy of the president is by no means a coincidence.Seems not.Lee Jang-hoon, an analyst at International Relations Division, wrote in the weekly Dong-A 2017, "" Facebook is the only American Daily Independent / Dong-A Ilbo Official Facebook of the Redistribution of the Prospection Movement, and Dotek Daily All-North is now closed to U.S. citizens. "" Chun Doo-hwan, the former president had pointed to the strong response to the evidence of a minister Lee to documents obtained by sbs.It is a solo report by Jeong Seong-jin.On May 11, 1995, during an ongoing investigation by the prosecution into May 18, 1995, Reverend American peterson visited the day before and testified before the prosecution that he witnessed a helicopter shooting in Gwangju in 1980, and produced a helicopter photo.In a confidential document on the history of the business, one of SBS ' investigators was outraged at the news of Reverend Peterson and ordered him to come up with a solution.The retired Army aviation chief, who was instructed to do so, met a helicopter pilot in May 18th, and when the pilots were indignant with the minister's testimony, Jeon was quoted as pushing for the suit.Reverend Barbara Peterson / Last Peterson : Because my husband (Reverend Peterson) gave a press conference and attended the prosecution, Chun was probably upset. However, we saw clearly that helicopters were shooting at citizens from the balcony.Jeon called in Ahn Hyun-tae, former chief of the National Security Council, on May 13 and said, "" We need to come up with strong countermeasures when the investigation moves to recognize the testimony of Reverend Peterson. ""[Kim Yang-rae / 5th & 18th] Standing Director of the Foundation : "" Shooting from a helicopter towards a unarmed citizen "" isn't the right to defend the right. The right to defend the right that the new military authorities tried to defend collapsed.The testimony by Reverend Peterson led to an investigation by involved helicopter pilots, who say there was no helicopter fire, but the investigation was completed without a on-site investigation to verify the testimony."
"If the investment rate of medium and medium goods falls by 10 percent, Korea's manufacturing sector is valued at 2.8 percent, and China is the biggest export destination as of 2016. And the country`s heavy materials and parts account for 74 percent of Korea`s exports to China. Exports to China are significant to the Korean manufacturing sector. However, China's industrial structure improvement policy is shaking up the export of medium to China. Although the retaliation for the deployment of the THAAD system, which began in July last year, appears to be resolved, the challenge remains to deal with changes in the Chinese export structure itself, more fundamentally resulting from China's industrial restructuring.Yonhap news agency, according to the trade sector and the Korea Development Bank on October 19, China has been pushing for radical reform of its industrial structure as its growth based on simple export of processed trade has reached a limit since the global financial crisis. In 2011, the Chinese government compiled a list of industrial restructuring programs to restructure the oversupply industry, and in May 2015, announced its manufacturing promotion policy, China Manufacturing 2025. Its goal is to become a manufacturing powerhouse at the level of Germany and Japan by 2025 and secure the strongest competitiveness among global manufacturers after 2035. The Chinese government's policy to change the structure of exporting intermediate goods after importing them is most damaging to Korean manufacturers. China's median income rose 30.3 percent year-on-year in 2010 alone, but fell 5.3 percent from a year earlier. As a result, Korea`s median exports to China shrank to $ 92.2 billion in 2016 from $ 184 billion in 2014. In particular, imports of Korean products from China decreased 16.4 percent from 2014 to last year, marking the biggest decline in Chinese imports, beating those of the U.S. (- 15.5 percent) and Japan (- 10.7 percent). As a result, Korea`s manufacturers ` exports rose to 6.0 percent from 28.3 percent in 2010. Korea`s trade surplus with China also dropped from 62.8 billion dollars in 2013 to 375 billion dollars last year.Once a year earlier, export expenditure decreased by 7.7 percent ... For the second year in a row, Pareto (Qingdao < China > Shinhwa = Yonhap News), China's Haegwan Series (Customs) announced on July 13 that its exports by $ 2.47 trillion won decreased year-on-year.The photo showed that the export container freighter, Bulls @a.co.CRE, anchored in the port of Qingdao, in eastern China's Shandong Province, lost about 10 percent of its domestic investment point to China's industrial restructuring. China`s decline in the supply of medium and medium sized Korean goods is estimated to have the effect of reducing the value added by 2.5 to 4.4 percent for each sector, according to a survey by a leading company. Chemical products had the highest value added reduction rate of 4.4 %, followed by petroleum refining (3.9 %), computer and precision equipment (3.7 %), rubber plastic / non-metal minerals (3.2 %) and electronics (2.5 %). As China increases its independence, its vertical division of labor is quickly shifting toward competition. As Chinese products become more competitive in quality with their prices, the export competitiveness index between Korean and Chinese products in the U.S. market rose from 56.1 in 2014 to 58.6 last year.

"▽ No news for 14 people, '' = The GNP practically rejected the idea of finding a new job, and the Red Sea correspondent in Seoul passed the party square Thursday in front of the election of a new leadership. The right party will convene a third meeting of its representatives to elect a new leadership. Ko Sang-min, a reporter for the political party's office, told The Liberal Democratic Party earlier this month, "" We did not return to the GNP after leaving the party en masse and burning a group of nine lawmakers. "" The leadership of the Korea Party said, "" Even though we accept the members, we can not hire an office. According to the party's original plan on July 19, 14 out of its 45 party officials submitted an application to the Korea Party via the committee. Four of the members left the former Saenuri Party and joined the right party, while the other 10 were hired by the right party. Sensing that the ruling party or part of the integration with the right party is underway, however, officials at the Korea Party were strongly opposed to hiring them early on, mostly by unions. In the end, the union leader went on a hunger strike. It was absurd to hire additional party officials as internal restructuring such as voluntary retirement went on. The leadership of the Korea Party has also drawn a line, and has virtually decided to "" not to hire "" them. According to the Korea official said in a closed meeting last week, Hong Joon-pyo, a representative from Saenuri Party, four has been restructuring would be, and the remaining ten special recruitment is, too.It's hard, quoted as saying. A GNP official told Yonhap news agency on Tuesday, It is illegal to accept some of the figures on a public loan basis. As a result of the restructuring, the number of people who are currently on standby is 16, he said, If we hire more workers under the labor law, we should do so first. As it is virtually impossible to move to the Korea Party, the right atmosphere at the party office is in chaos. Some of the 14 applicants withdrew their applications and went to other workplaces and the list goes around, creating a collective atmosphere of bullying.

The Korea Meteorological Administration analyzed the depth of the quake at 9 kilometers. The agency initially announced the magnitude of the quake at 3.7 through early warning, but lowered it to 3.5 after self-analysis. The Korea Meteorological Administration analyzed that the quake was also an aftershock from the last Pohang earthquake. The earthquake was the third largest among the earthquakes in Pohang. The biggest aftershock was 4.3 which occurred at 4:49 p.m. on the day of the main earthquake (magnitude 5.4), which was followed by 3.6 at 9:2:42 a.m. on July 16. On July 15, the main earthquake date, 3:09 p.m., also occurred, with aftershocks of magnitude 3.5. As of this time, there have been 57 aftershocks from the Pohang earthquake.

Therefore, many lawmakers keep their existing contact information alive even if they prepare new cell phones to avoid text terror. Of course, many of them keep their original contact information alive to induce text bombs on themselves to existing phones.

"■ News 1 : Choi Jin-mo, designer of Song-Tao, and assistant secretary of the Central Committee, Heo Jung-tae, who is scheduled to visit Korea today, will stop visiting Seoul for two months. According to foreign news reports on July 19, Songtao, head of the Communist Party's liaison division, and Choe Ryong-hae, who visited Pyongyang as special envoy for Chinese President Xi Jinping, visited North Korea on July 17. North Korea`s state-run Korean Central News Agency reported on the first day of the visit that Soong-yong explained in detail the outcome of the 19th round of the party elections and stressed his commitment to further develop the friendship between the two countries. In a separate article, Song and Ri Soo-yong, vice chairman of the International Labor Party, also met to discuss issues of mutual concern on the Korean Peninsula and the region, the news agency said. Although the details of the discussion were not disclosed, the situation on the Korean Peninsula, including the North Korean nuclear issue, is likely to have been widely debated. In particular, since Soong-yong is expected to return to Korea on July 20, chances are high that an interview with Kim Jong Un will take place later this day. As he is a special envoy of President Xi, he is likely to deliver his message in person. China's state-run exchange office has once ruled that Song`s visit should not be overly anticipated, but wouldn't it be complicated to explain the results of the recent U.S.-China summit? In fact, Kim Dong-yup, a professor at the Far East Studies Center at Kyungnam University, recently cited the relationship with China as one of the reasons why North Korea is not provocative. Professor Kim said, Changes in the current administration and relations with the United States after the 19th Congress could rather be a double-edged sword for North Korea, and North Korea is better utilizing the U.S. version.

Against this backdrop, some predict that China's policy toward the Korean Peninsula will develop more aggressively, gradually reinforcing its involvement and stabilizing the situation on the Korean Peninsula. If Song can receive positive messages from the North through the visit, the current situation will be more quickly shifted.Regarding this, Kim said North Korea announced officially begins winter training with a massive artillery fire drill on Dec. 1 last year, adding, As North Korea is about to begin winter training, it should keep an eye on winter training.flyhighrom@news1.kr and read the news on CSAT (United States of America)!

Kim Seon-ho, a reporter at the Korea Institute of Geological Resources (Yonhap news), said, "" Korea National University of Science and Technology confirmed the release of its liquid research team around Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province, on July 15. Liquefaction is the phenomenon of strong earthquake shaking in which muddy water from beneath the ground rises above the surface and changes ground to a liquid state.

We will unveil a plan next week to scrap the rules on network neutrality that prohibited network operators from discriminating against Internet users, a local source quoted. Network neutrality is the principle that network operators should treat network users equally without discriminating. The key is to prohibit access blocking, speed control and no prioritization.That is, it should only allow access to A and should not block B. Internet speed should not be provided with 100 Mbps for A and 10 Mbps for B. Even though traffic is heavy, one should not give A preferential treatment to access first. Network neutrality is cited as the background behind Google and Facebook's growth of contents and platform providers to become global enterprises. Service as a platform operator was enabled based on the network infrastructure established by the communication service operator. It grew, causing huge Internet traffic, but did not have to pay any extra charges beyond the access charges. The previous Obama administration was a strong supporter of the principle of network neutrality. However, the Trump administration said it should scrap its network-neutrality principle. Networks say network neutrality "" reduces network operators ' investment in network infrastructure and prevents them from providing innovative services. "" They claim that despite the high cost and hard work of networking, platform operators are earning large sums of money.Meanwhile, Rep. Edward Markey of the United States Democratic Party released a counterargument saying, Investment increased from $ 8.6 billion in 2014 to $ 87.2 billion in 2015.The Internet Association of America, which Google, Facebook, Netflix and Twitter are members of the U.S. Internet Association, officially visited the pie committee in April to maintain its stance on network neutrality. Civic groups and the Democratic Party, which have supported network-neutrality, are also strongly joining forces with Silicon Valley to demand that the principle of network neutrality be maintained.The vote for scrapping network neutrality is expected to take place on December 14, when the FCC regular meeting is held. It is a strategy to deal with controversial issues when public attention is focused elsewhere during the holiday season, said TechCrunch, an IT professional media organization. The outcome of the vote is likely to have a huge impact on the U.S. and the global ICT ecosystem. The FCC has served as the global standard for internet-related policies.In Korea, discussion on network neutrality has begun. Local mobile operators say the nation needs to ease the networks ` neutrality. With the 5G era ahead, the diffusion of the object Internet (IoT), virtual and augmented reality and UHD contents was predicted. Massive network investment is needed to handle explosive traffic growth. They believe that reducing network neutrality will help to charge separate network utilization from larger platforms, and further enhance network facilities.Meanwhile, the FCC received public comments on network neutrality via its website, with more than 22 million comments. These are generally the arguments against abolishing network neutrality.Kim Dong-pyo, reporter of the Korea Baseball Organization, letmein@asiae.co.krA fishing boat member, A (35), was found dead at a reservoir in Yeongsa-eup, Icheon City at 7:30 a.m. on July 12 when he found a patrol boat.

"- World's average growth rate more than tripled - Base effect and semiconductor boom combined to record the highest rate of Korean exports this year among the 10 biggest exporting countries on the back of the semiconductor boom. According to the World Trade Organization's (WTO) monthly export statistics, the world's major export items accounted for nearly 71 % of the increase in exports from January to September this year (about 90 % of global trade).Korea ranked first among the world`s top 10 exporting countries, exporting 18.5 percent of its annual exports. In other words, it has been ranked first since the first, second and third quarters of this year. Exports, in particular, increased by 35.0 percent in September, more than tripled from the global average of 11.1 percent. Korea`s exports performance was first reflected in the fundamental effects of the falling oil prices last year. In addition, semiconductor companies ' record performance has led the overall export, and as oil prices have recovered, the price of petrochemical products has risen significantly.The industry sectors were affected by the world`s economic rebound, the rise in unit prices of major products, diversifying export items and boosting the export of emerging markets, an official at the Commerce Ministry said.Korea`s export ranking rose two notches to sixth this year, as exports rose faster than those of other major economies. It fell to 8th place in 2016 from 6th in 2015, but has recovered to 6th place. China and the United States are maintaining first and second place positions, respectively. Exports are expected to remain strong, as the global economic recovery continues. However, uncertainties remain over the pace of monetary tightening in major countries, such as the U.S. and Europe, spreading protectionism, and the instability of international oil prices due to the Middle East situation.(Unit : a sustained anti-Buddhist, %) gimsangyun, ▶ (yoon@edaily.co.kr) Naver in the channel please subscribe to the ‘edaily’ ▶ '8 sting. - notes gael' of the event of ▶ katok peulchin, Starbucks.Coupon or ♥ < © 5 Kits combine a comprehensive financial information media edaily ②. - 1 - 1 - illegal ban on war damage and redistribution > in recovery of the local economy, a U.S. interest rate that is certain. 2.- 3. increase potential growth rate is still of high household debt increase [edaily a Kim Jong Nam] "" the third quarter economic growth this year surpassing its benchmark interest rate increase requirements.Meet.

One of the first things to see is economic recovery. Economic growth is forecast to surpass 3 percent this year. It has been the first time in three years since the previous year (3.3 percent). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast 3.2 percent. It is growing far beyond expectations. The logic behind raising the key interest rate when the economy is in good shape also suggests that the monetary policy will remain strong when the economy is sluggish. This means that they should be put on when they can be raised.With the number of healthy quarterly growth figures, the conditions for the normalization of monetary policy have been set up, said Yoon Jeong-sam, head of Meritz Securities Co.The prospect that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise the key interest rate next month could affect the domestic monetary policy. Currently, the U.S. base rate is 1.00 to 1.25 %. If the rate rises, the benchmark rate will rise by 1.25 to 1.50 percent, higher than that of Korea.Although the central bank officials say, "" It is not immediately affected by the US monetary policy, "" they have only had two previous rate reversal periods (1999-2001, 2005-2007). In addition, it has not been seen in the last 10 years. The United States ` continuous impression can not help but put pressure on the BOK.Korea should adjust its key interest rates as global monetary policy is progressing, said Suh Hyang-mi, an economist at Korea Investment & Securities Co.Some say that the hike in November's key interest rates, following the real estate and household debt measures in August, will reveal the will of the policymakers. It is a so-called "" policy package. ""As the impressions are clear, some say that the viewing point is rather unanimous. The central bank has not raised its key interest rate for nearly six and a half years since June 2011 (3.00 % → 3.25 %). Meanwhile, the benchmark interest rate fell to 1.25 percent. This month, the commission could make a big difference as it is the first time it has changed its interest rate policy, which is set to be cut by more than six years. The three experts, who had predicted a unanimous approval, cited the symbolism as a major reason.Both the central bank`s officials and officials say they should be well aware of the lack of an impression on the issue, including Chairman Lee Joo-yol. ◇ The current term is "" trans-increasion of the won, "" but it is still possible to freeze the won. Three out of ten people forecast this, but it is estimated that it is larger than expected. In particular, the financial market is in a dire mood with the Monetary Policy Committee approaching. That is because the value of the won is skyrocketing. The won-dollar exchange rate closed at 1097.5 won on July 17, the lowest in a year and two months. A rise in the benchmark rate of more than six years could add to the won`s steep rise. The problem is that the won`s strength is bad news for the export front. In addition, the pressure on inflation will decrease and the possibility of a fund outflow will decrease. That is why some in the market are raising their eyebrows this month.
