In the car parked at the rear, the male driver (40) stepped down and asked, "" Why did you stop at a parking lot that was reserved for women? "" And he said, "" If you have a seat, why did you stop the elevator? "" As the "" women-only parking lot "" that allows women to park has become less effective, critics say that extra measures are needed. Most men park, but there are no specific sanctions, and the controversy over reverse discrimination on why only women are considered remains. After the crime, women drivers are feeling more anxious. According to Seoul City yesterday, the women-only parking area was put into full swing when the city passed the "" Parking Space Installation and Management Act "" in 2009. Parking spaces for women in their 30s and older are required to have more than 10 percent of parking areas. As more and more crimes are committed against women in parking lots, the cars were designed to prevent them and improve their convenience. Based on this, public parking lots, department stores, and discount stores nationwide had women-only parking areas with pink parking lines on them. Usually, women-only parking is reserved for female drivers, including pregnant women. For male drivers, this is only possible when accompanied by an infant. However, it has not been properly adhered to for nearly 10 years. From September 9-11, Money Touday looked around 6 parking lots for women in Seoul, including Mapo-gu, Yangcheon-gu, and Gangseo-gu, and found that 70 % of drivers (53 %) parked in the parking lots were parked there. Most of them knew it was for women, but did not seem to care. Office worker Choi Joon-seok (48) said, "" Women do not know the place to park. "" A 35-year-old office worker, Shin, criticized it, saying, I was in the same car with a woman, and I don`t think it would be okay to park.Still, there are no specific measures to take. Since there are no clauses related to parking in the parking lot for the disabled, men do not pay fines or fines. Some male drivers even called the women-only parking area "" reverse discrimination. "" Office worker Hwang Seung-koo (34) said, "" It is reverse discrimination to have more private spaces such as the women's lounge, parking lots, and the subway. ""Some female drivers also complained. Housewife Kim Mi-hee (36) said, I hope men can get rid of the parking ban at all, saying, I don`t don't think this is the case, but only women are being criticized for nothing. Women especially asked for safety measures in women-only parking. Office worker Lee Da-hye (29) said, "" We either needed a minimum emergency bell for a women-only parking area or we needed a device to protect ourselves from crime, and the parking lines were pink and the rest were identical to regular parking lots. "" In fact, in 2015, a man kidnapped and murdered a woman in a parking lot exclusively for women at a large discount store, creating a sense of uneasiness. In response, a city official said, It has so far mainly been PR focus since there is really nothing that the law can do to enforce, and that it is difficult for us to ensure that the law is effectively implemented.

"Woo Byung-woo (Yonhap news agency), who is now facing a lawsuit against a South Korean presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae, is now facing an arrest warrant for former South Korean presidential chief of staff Woo Byung-woo. Ko Dong-Wook (Seoul = Yonhap News Agency) - Former presidential secretary for civil affairs Woo Byung-woo was arrested on July 15, and prosecutors are also focusing on whether he will be arrested or not due to a series of releases and failures of arrest cases. Prior to Woo's arrest, the prosecution appeared to have faced difficulties with various variables. Former Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin and his counterpart Kim Kwan-jin, who were involved in the cyber warfare, were released after they applied for questioning at the court, and former presidential aide Kim Tae-tae, who was arrested by Cheong Wa Dae for involvement in the alleged involvement in the arrest of an overseas investigation. Former NIS Director Won Se-hoon is known to have shut down and refused to cooperate with the investigation on the suspicion of involvement in the NIS politics on the other day of the investigation into the scandal. Lee Myung-bak, which are considered 'destination' the former president of the two investigations for direct investigation is to be difficult it is that she gave birth to. Critics said the prosecution is obsessed with the arrest process and forced them to seek a warrant for the arrest warrant. Although the process ended with an explanation of what was meant as an "" inspiratory remark, "" Prosecutor-General Moon Moo-il said earlier that he would not be able to complete the crucial part of the probe by the end of the year, making it difficult for investigators to find additional drivers. Prosecutors are considering Woo Byung-woo, the symbolic key figure who was arrested during the investigation to clear up the deep-rooted corruption scandal, a significant meaning that the prosecution is considering. There have been many controversies over the negative or flawed investigation into Woo. Prosecutors launched two arrest warrants late last year when they searched Woo for alleged corruption in state affairs and private affairs, and wondered whether he was smiling with his arms folded indoors, sparking a "" summons "" by the emperor. The prosecution has found an opportunity to recover trust by arresting Wu out of the negative view. This time, as well as his right applies to the former chief Park Geun-hye, is already going on trial on charges of government gukjjeong nongdan the area of overlap with suspicion have a future investigation.There is likely to serve as the power to a standstill.Made in a paddy waggon choesunsil (=, Yonhap News Agency, Seoul, Korea) choejaegu reporters are brought on by the constitutional president of the first impeachment gukjjeong nongdan, a key figure in the incident 'nasal glands power' Mr. choesunsil a lower court's ruling.14 days to attend the final trial, and is entering the Central District Court, Seocho-gu, Seoul. 2017.12.14 had instructed the National Intelligence Service during his term to the U, a former senior former president's special inspector, iseokssu bangmingwon, vice minister and other senior Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism.Executives and igwanggu, former chief of Woori Bank, and Kim Jin-sun, the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics Organizing Committee officials and civilians, including accused of illegal surveillance operations. Former head of the bureau, Choo Myung-ho, who did not receive orders from the temple and reported the results to the NIS chief, described the results as a non-disclosure to Wu. Choo is also suspected of protecting the NIS officials who collected information on the secret heavyweight Choi Soon-sil and then democrating him. Therefore, it can not be ruled out that the investigation results against Woo could reveal additional clues by the government, such as Choi's involvement in the appointment of financial circles and his involvement in concessions related to Pyeongchang Olympics. Park Geun-hye inaugural members of or support from the government ruled out the investigation is 'black list case' that he had expanded state. Further investigation by prosecutors is drawing attention as former senior prosecutor Woo and NIS have suspected of discounting or examining not only the cultural and art circles, but also scientists, educational figures and organizations. However, many predict that if Woo's attitude is considered during the investigation and trial, he will not change his mind significantly after being arrested. In this case, the NIS investigation could be put to an end with Woo's arrest. In responding to questioning by the prosecution late last month, Woo said, I have stood on the photo line four times in the past year and felt it was my duty to accept and move on. sncwook@yna.co.kr It is estimated that the situation of the Zwick situation was reenacted after a group of local netizens who claimed that Haeja inadvertently left for China to participate in the mainland matches were attacked. According to Taiwan's annual news program, Haiza is scheduled to compete with Weibo (Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram for the last time before the 2017 International Mind Games Baduk Contest. However, when they saw the incident, Chinese Internet users took issue with the two words ' leaving the country. ' Chinese Internet users asked, "" What's the destination of Haija's trip to Mainland China? "" Taiwan's entry into the Chinese competition can not use the word "" departure "" because it is a part of the domestic rather than international competition. Other Internet users openly denounced Haizhazi, which means Taiwan's independent group, as immature.

China's baduk model also made a lot of money, and how can you say such a thing?

"▽ New Seoul = Former Presidential Secretary for Civil Affairs Woo Byung-woo, who was detained for involvement in illegal surveillance and non-reporting reports, wrapped up his vehicle examination at Seoul Central District Court on July 14. Lee Seok-soo, chief of the Presidential Office of Civil Affairs at Cheong Wa Dae, illegally inspected by Suncho 21 Newsis.com, was arrested by questioning Lee Seok-soo, and admitted that Cheong Wa Dae is guilty of murder, and that it is destroying evidence. According to legal circles on July 15, a judge of the Seoul Central District Court issued a warrant against former chief of staff Kwon Soon-ho for obstructing him with his right to abuse his authority and point out Lee's involvement in an illegal investigation. Former Chief of Staff Woo is accused of having asked Choo Myung-ho, former director of the NIS's national security strategy bureau, to investigate Lee's background in the investigation. Lee, who was in conflict with Woo over the sale of Nexon Corp., also said in court, explaining why Woo had refused to do so. Prosecutors earlier expressed confidence that they would issue a warrant for Woo's arrest. Prosecutors explained that key officials of the case, including former Commissioner General Choo, had a meaningful statement on the allegation and secured enough evidence including documents. Prosecutors also judged that the former chief of staff Wu is likely to destroy evidence. He denied most of the accusations and claimed that he saw them as part of his normal work. Regarding this, the prosecution pointed out that "" the site of the law is liable for the breach. "" It is interpreted to mean that legal experts like Woo could not have known whether or not it was illegal. Prosecutors are known to have strongly claimed this point in their review of arrest.Judge Kwon, who is in charge of the screening, first believed that various illegal inspections, blacklist instructions, and management of Woo's office were summoned.

Former Chief of Staff Wu decided that he would destroy evidence in this regard. The criminal suit law provides for the possibility of arresting a person guilty of a crime, destroying evidence or even running away. In Woo's case, the fact that he was found to have destroyed evidence in connection with the illegal surveillance by former inspectors significantly influenced the arrest. Former Chief Executive Woo said earlier, "" I have escaped both arrest crises. All arrest warrants requested by special prosecutors Park Young-soo and the special prosecutors ' office were rejected by the court. The reason is that it is difficult to recognize the reason and necessity for arresting Woo. The second warrant was rejected because the contents of the charges could have been disputed, and the evidences had not been sufficiently called to destroy evidence or escape. Kwon was the chief judge in charge of screening for warrants at the time. However, in the end, Wu was caught on suspicion of "" illegally inspecting "" the former inspector who had inspected him. naun@newsis.com> misting on the windshield while driving is a winter time when it will exceed a heater by - 10 degrees with de-humidified air conditioning. Drivers, especially novice drivers, are in a more difficult season. Let's take a look at some simple driving patterns for winter. When the air is steamed by the breath of passengers while driving, direct the wind to the windshield and turn the air conditioning on. I ride with my family. Everyone seems to have had a bit of experience being blocked in from view due to the steam on the windshield while driving. Because of the fact that this haze has a great influence on safe driving, it should be removed immediately. If you turn on the air conditioner, it disappears when you put the air in free circulation mode to let in fresh air, not just the heater. Air conditioning has a dehumidification effect, making the dull windows clean quickly. If you turn on the air conditioner and turn on the thermostat, you won't get cold winds, so don't worry about the cold. Placing the car in the outdoor circulation mode while driving usually helps prevent misting. If the air conditioner is turned on while the air circulation mode is turned on, it can prevent the cold and remove the misting quickly. The extreme drop in temperature can also cause frost to freeze the glass outside the car parked outside. If the washer fluid is applied and the wipers are operated excessively, the particles of ice can damage the wiper rubber or leave a blemish on the car glass. Also, if hot water is poured out suddenly, glass can be damaged. In this case, activate the heated heat or turn on the heater to remove frost before starting. When parking outdoors is unavoidable, covering up a single newspaper can help prevent frost from hitting the windshield. The rubber state of the wiper must be kept clean to ensure clear vision during operation. Washer fluid is more used than expected in winter. Open the fountain in the cap and always fill it with the washer fluid. Winter washer fluid use is higher than expected. Washer fluid may be poured in as if it were a little too much. When it snows or rains while driving, the water flowing from the nearby vehicle due to the low temperature is not dry ; it is often muddy and buried in the windshield. This should be cleaned frequently with a washer fluid. In winter, you will use more washer fluid than you think. Therefore, it is always recommended to check and make up for the problems. If the water is filled instead of the washer fluid in the summer, it may break the associated parts when it is cold in the winter when it falls below zero, so it is essential to fill it up after draining it. It is said that normal battery charge is green when the battery is in green, but you should check the voltage error in the cold weather because battery performance can be significantly decreased. Battery performance is also likely to drop during cold winter. Maintenance technician Kim Woo-seok (36, Goyang City, Gyeonggi-do) says, "" It would be best not to park outside of the vehicle in cold weather, but it is advisable to check the battery voltage at the car center in advance in case of discharge. "" The battery cover says that green battery fluid is normal, but it may discharge even if green battery fluid is normal. When you're already out of gas, it's quicker to call your insurance company without panic. It is good to have your insurance number in a visible place in the car. Winter tire, known as snow tire. It is not always used when it snows. Rubber maintains consistency in the cold weather and keeps the traction by rippling the surface. Always check the tire wear levels, regardless of season. Especially during winter when the temperature is low, due to the nature of rubber, the tires can be tightened to reduce traction. In this case, it is advisable to replace the winter tire known as a snow tire. Winter tyres have a smooth wavy groove on the surface and softer material than conventional tires, keeping traction in cold winter. If the rubber is applied to the margin of motion of the tyre's groove, the grip can not be maintained. Tires that are older than five years of manufacture must also be replaced because of poor rubber performance. Meanwhile, tires worn to the limit line must be replaced in advance since they have already lost their function. Due to the nature of the rubber, the rubber is hardened on tires over five years old, reducing the grip. After a heavy snow, wash the car under the car. Calcium chloride sprinkled to remove snow will mix with water and enter the underside of the vehicle, causing corrosion when old. Nowadays, since self-cleaning car parks can carry out the lower car wash, one can easily wash the car with a car for thousands of won. Finally, it is advisable not to use the brakes as possible when riding in snow or ice. No matter how good a four-wheel drive is, one-sliding vehicles are harder for the average person to control. Slow speed is the shortcut to safe driving. Kang Jung-hyun : Centralized Daily [Facebook] [Kakao Plus Friend] [MobileWeb][Movile web] and JTBC Content Hub Co., Ltd."

Week from his former lawmaker dj's slush fund scandal received a report a backlash is expected to. NASA's artificial intelligence has done the job of finding extraterrestrial planets. It is expected that artificial intelligence will play a greater role in space exploration. NASA announced on July 15 that it had discovered the 8th planet to be discovered around its star, Kepler-90`s Kepler, after analyzing its data sent from the Kepler Space Telescope using Google Machine Run. The discovery is significant in that it has discovered an alien solar system with the same number of planets as our own. The planet was named Kepler-90I. Located approximately 2545 light years from Earth, the planet is a hot rock planet that orbits around the "" Kepler-90""stands 14.4 days. NASA has discovered the presence of the planet by learning from its Google Machine running techniques what Kepler sent us. Dr. Paul Hurtz, NASA's astrophysics director, said, "" As we expected, Kepler data revealed interesting things to us many years before they were revealed. "" Comparison of the solar system with the same number of planets and the ' Kepler-90'antity system. Comparing planets in size, the Kepler-90s feature larger planets as they move outward. NASA researchers have learned how to identify an extraterrestrial planet with a light signal recorded on Kepler. For example, when planets move past stars, they can read light accurately as the brightness of light changes. Learning about the previous findings, Google Artificial Neural Networks finally found a tiny signal from the 8th planet orbiting the Kepler-90s, previously missing in Draco constellations. Artificial neural networks have proven to be a useful tool for identifying very weak signals in the universe. NASA estimated that Kepler-90I is about 30 percent larger than Earth and so close to stars that the average surface temperature is nearly as hot as that of Mercury in the Solar System. The extra-terrestrial ' Kepler-90h ' orbits the sun about as far as the Earth. The research team said, Kepler-90`s system is the same as the solar sector`s mini-version. Inside, there is a small planet, outside, and every planet is much closer to the stars than the solar system, "" Keppler said. These are all potential candidates for extraterrestrial planets. NASA expects to find many more planetary signals in the future with artificial neural networks.Senior Kwok No-pil Correspondent nopil@hani.co.kr [Daily subscription] [link people and animals : Animal People] [KakaoTalk] [ⓒ Hanger-iler newspaper : Don't illegally reproduce or redistribute it]"

Gasping for breath, he hurried back to the logistics car. It looked like a sprinter. He ran for over six hours a day. Kim did not even feel a cold snap of 10 degrees below zero on July 14, when the wind was blowing fiercely. The reason why he has to run like this is because of the short delivery time. His commute to work at the logistics terminal is at 7 a.m. The sorting work begins. You can not go on the delivery until the afternoon after you finish working about seven hours. About 200-300 items need to be delivered per day, but 50 per hour is not enough to ship in time. No matter how hard I move, I will not go home until 11 p.m.  The way Kim moves from car to car. As he has to deliver hundreds of items in a limited time, he is always on alert. If he does not respond when you press the doorbell, or if he does not answer the phone, all of his planned lines are twisted. Meanwhile, the reminder telephone presses on him, "" Why not come early? "" So he said, I thank the client who tells me to leave it with the security office when he called to say the courier was not there. The most unfair cases are the customer's error in delivering the product to pay for the lost articles. We don`t feel comfortable paying hundreds of thousands of won in cash when we have to pay them back, he said. Collecting returned items is also not easy. I went into an office and called it "" Return collection "" several times, but no one was there. The reporter's heart was on edge. After collecting the returns, he returned to the elevator, but the elevator left. Looking disappointingly at the elevator he had left, he ran toward the stairs, panting heavily.  Kim is running up the stairs with the stuff. Maybe an hour and 20 minutes passed. For the first time, a restaurant customer said, "" Thank you. "" It was a welcome remark to him who was fighting with one second per minute. The cold swept over me when the sun went down. The car that didn't turn on the heater was just like the outside. `` If you keep running, you sweat all over. '' His hair was dripping wet from his hat. There was another reason why he had to run, forgetting the cold. Two years ago, he got involved in this job to raise money for a wedding. "" I started out because the courier service said I could make money in a short time, but it turned out that I wasn't making a lot of money, it was just collecting it because I couldn't spend it, "" he said bitterly. "" If I work 16 hours a day, I don't have the time or energy to spend. They are also disconnected and live as if they were just making money. "" The delivery was seen by a delivery man, Kim Gyeong-hwan (38), who was not likely to be on the floor by 8 p.m. The time for dinner was well past. As I entered the residential area, the smell of delicious stew reeked. I could not bring myself to ask her when to eat as she was running with sweat on her back. say@heraldcorp.com"

Dozens of men and women lined up at Manila's NinoI Aquino International Airport in the Philippines at around 10:30 a.m. Tuesday. There was a number mark on each breast, from one to 47. They went through security checks with guidance from airport employees. Around them, airport police looked fiercely at them. The only 47 suspects were those who fled to the Philippines after committing various crimes here. He was at a foreign detention center under the Lee Min-cheong administration in the Philippines and arrived at the airport by sharing the car in 20 cars that morning. During the journey, 120 Lee and his team members monitored them. Forty-seven criminals who were extradited from the Philippines by charter plane leave Incheon International Airport Thursday. Incheon = Yang Hoe-seong, a reporter at the airport, had an airplane belonging to Korea's low-cost airline, or LCU.

"▽ Sexual violence disclosure campaign begun in Hollywood = As the spread of opinions, culture, and politics spread to the media and the world, the "" Macrobial movement of men in empathy and support, "" domestic and international consciousness began last year, the declaration of the victims of literature community last year was opened by the International Police Agency These are the women who used the hashtag # MeToo to expose that I was sexually assaulted, leading to social change. More than 1 million Twitter postings were posted last week after actress Alisa Milano proposed a Mitu campaign on October 15. Celebrities were also involved in revelations about political, media and cultural figures. Hollywood tycoon Harvey Weinstein, who started the story, was kicked out of his own company. Congressman John Conius announced his retirement from politics, and anchor for CBS and NBC were fired. At least 74 public figures faced criticism, Time analyzed. The exposure of the weak, social solidarity and substantial change. Can such a campaign take place in Korea? One thing is clear, at least when you look at the series of hashtag campaigns that took place following the murders of two cities last year. Korean women also kept shouting "" Mitu. "" The victims ' voices say they were sexually assaulted by poet Bae Yong-je in social media last October were heard. They used a hash tag : ' # Parling_Narry_Corporal Violation, ' and said, "" Bae called the students into his own writing room and proposed sex. "" "" I will make you the first man to talk about sexual harassment. "" Other victims who were silent also spoke. The names of big names have gone up and down. In addition, sexual violence in the cultural and artistic circles, such as art, film, and music has emerged as a social issue on the hashtag of # ○○ Inter_NALLY. It was a Korean version of the Mitu campaign. Bae was arrested in February on charges of sex abuse and harassment by a minor under power. Some of the perpetrators have posted apologies and declared an end to their activities. Meanwhile, criminal accusations against the victims were also frequent. According to Chedow Pins, a coalition group that helps victims of sexual violence, 50 people asked for counseling on charges of exposing hashtags between October and December last year or threatening to file a complaint. # This is _ the woman's _ ` hashtag ` movement has not stopped. The book, titled `` This _ Woman's Vernacular, '' was unveiled in February after controversy erupted over the sexual orientation of a private house, titled `` A Retreat, '' in 2015. In the beginning, it was a dispositional humor to say that ' a woman's room is neat and well decorated. ' However, she has gradually turned into a place to share the fears she experienced while living in Korea as a woman herself. A man came in immediately before the door closed, the insidious text of a messenger, the sound of a click outside in the shower. The hashtag served not only to damage sexual crimes, but also to convey the daily fears women felt. Women pleaded for each other's safety by giving advice such as "" Be irregular in your return time "" or "" Use a crusher to remove your parcel post. "" Portals introducing inexpensive "" window security clips "" were re-tweeted more than 2,000 times. # Police _ the assailant? `` I accused a man of stalking and threatening sexual assault and murder for four years and releasing my personal information online, police said. "" I hope you're pretty. "" On July 10, a Korean woman, a domestic violence and sexual violence counseling agency, suggested a campaign called "" # Police, "" or "" Victim_Alter. "" The hashtag movement, which accused police of second-stage damages, saw 200,000 people take part in it in three days. The book, which was unveiled by a Korean woman's phone, contained 112 testimony on Twitter. When I reported domestic violence, I sat back and said, "" Maybe it's because Dad's mad, "" and I pointed out the clothes of an illegal shoot victim and said, "" Did you like it? "" Later, a petition was posted on the presidential office's website requesting "" re-training the perception of domestic violence and sexual violence against the police and enhancing penalties for inappropriate responses. "" About 15,000 people have signed the petition since July 11. The controversy over the sexual assault of Han Sam-saem erupted in late October in South Korea, when the media were covered with ' Mitu ' _ and the same as social media. A new employee of furniture maker Hansaem posted an article on the Internet, claiming that he experienced a series of illegal shooting, rape and attempted sexual assault. He said he could not handle the company's atmosphere of being branded as a "" flower snake, "" and was reprimanded by the company after announcing the rape. Police have dropped the case because of insufficient evidence, but the victim has re-appointed a lawyer. Looking at the hashtag, or `` change and _ no change, '' posted to celebrate the first anniversary of the murders in the station, the majority of Internet users said they were concerned about women's rights. What hasn't changed is a world that makes me bitter and sensitive. Hash tag, interest in feminism was women's movement urging the walls of reality, but still lead the age of women is higher. Until you said "" Mito, "" the Hashtag (# YesAllWomen) campaign was held in the United States in a similar manner to the Mitu campaign in 2014. There was an explosive reaction at the time, but there was skepticism that the hashtag movement was not really going to make a difference. American IT magazine reporter Jesse Hempel claimed, "" Right after the Mittoo campaign, social media easily expresses anger becomes a stumbling block to social change. "" Feminist blog ‘pemini The Sting’ founder Jessica Valenti, are in the centre away from the perspective of victims even say that it is time to make a list of perpetrators. Amid these concerns, the empathy and support of men was a significant change. According to a week-long analysis by British telegraph, 30 percent of Twitter participants were male.

"The Korean Federation of Block Chaining and Self-regulation Committee, or Korea Federation of Block Association, announced Monday morning at the International Conference of Banks in central Seoul. On the left, the co-chairman of the co-chairman Kim Hwa-jun (copyright holder (c) shall not make a joint news, unauthorized currency transaction starting January 1 next year and shall be made with an enhanced account of one person. The listing of new cipher currency (registration of the Korea Exchange) will be postponed. The Korean Federation of Block Chaining Associations announced yesterday a joint statement on the voluntary regulation of the crypto-sharing market. The plan is designed to collect opinions from the industry and banks on the recommendation of the government joint task force. Fourteen domestic companies including Bitsham, Coinwen and Corbit are represented at the association's committee. According to the self-regulating measures, virtual accounts with enhanced self-assertiveness will be introduced on January 1 next year. A system provided by the bank would allow the bank to deposit virtual accounts in the won only when the user information held by the exchange matches the information registered at the bank. If the two information is not consistent, you can not make an accommodation. In addition, they are limited to transactions with one person in their own name only. It also provides investor protection. The Cryptocode Exchange should separate and store and manage its own and customer assets. For this reason, the clients ' won-deposit amount should be deposited at financial institutions by 100 percent. In addition, more than 70 percent of the company`s cancer-causing waste should be kept in a cold storage purse with tightened security standards. Cold storage is an external storage device that is not connected to the Internet, which can reduce the likelihood of an attack from hackers. It also strengthens the requirements for exchange membership. Companies that operate cipher strengths in the currency exchange have stated that they have more than 2 billion won in capital. In addition, the ministry should provide an information security system that matches that of financial institutions and operate an information protection staff. An offline public service center shall be operated and computerized to receive and process client complaints. The commission also said in a joint statement that it would suspend marketing and ads that are likely to fuel speculation and withhold listing all new cipher strengths. First of all, it will invest in security and announce the size of its investment relative to marketing and business expenses. In the future, he said, "" When listing a new password, we will provide the information on the encrypted currency. "" Kim Jin-hwa, co-president of the Korean Federation of Block Chainings, said, "" This is a strong and effective measure that is being implemented worldwide.

But, he also mentioned the THAAD issue this time, following his second summit in Danang, Vietnam last month. The Korean government expected the THAAD system to be completed according to the bilateral agreement at the end of October, but it was put to sleep again.○ The two leaders did not mention the THAAD missiles directly in their remarks at the Beijing Great Hall of the People.

"[Hankyoreh] [Toyopan] Lee Jin-soon's open dentist Kang Chang-yong : "" I don't mind if I go to pot. I don't mind. Our dental clinic is like a sailing boat in a storm. I'm willing to lose my job and try to improve it. "" Senior reporter Kang Jae-hoon khan@hani.co.kr 3 years ago, he was suffering from excessive medical care, and he gave up on poverty when he appeared on the program. He wrote, "" I want to talk to go to YouTube, Facebook University, and I want to go to go to a high school. "" It is like a poisonous drug. Good use is bad, but bad use is bad. Some of them succeed, as they came so fiercely to get over poverty and misery and rise in society. Economic stability, decent titles and social honor are obtained, but the painful memories of the past are never erased and the desire for deprivation is limitless. More money, more honor, more status hunger and hunger are not easily met. It is a common characteristic of middle-aged people who have cherished the wounds of war and poverty as pre-integrative figures. Those who succeeded in doing so have established order for the mainstream and defined social coordinates of our times. Fortunately, there are different kinds of people in the world. Those who know the misery of poverty and do not mind poverty, and those who know the bitterness of social virtue and the pain of exclusion, who never stop being isolated from their suffering, have wistfully captured themselves. A few but not a few of these are enough to let us breathe in. Kang Chang-yong (46) is an 11-year-old dentist who graduated from Seoul National University with a degree in dentistry. Born in Seoul in 1971, he failed to go to high school due to poverty. When his friends went to college via high school, he delivered Jajangmyeon and newspapers with a medium school degree. She entered Seoul National University after passing the qualification examination late at the age of 27, but worked part-time jobs until she graduated from college to finance her tuition. In the period of high growth and unprecedented economic prosperity in the 1970s and 80s, he had no family to turn to and no adults to help. I felt destitute and lonely. After graduating from a prestigious university, he became a doctor, but he still lives as a doctor who makes no money. The hospital he runs is called the "" honesty dentist "" or "" bullying dentist. "" He is still poor and lonely. It's a path of choice. Why? I wanted to ask why do you live for what you do and why you live for what you do as a normal career, not as a priest or a social activist. In December 2017, when the year was coming to an end, I wanted to meet someone who would design time by finding their own perfect coordinates, not by floating buoys, in the wake of the times.She called the hospital several times to see a strange dentist who sees only 19 people a day, but the call was impossible. Only short recording of a doctor's appointment was repeated and the phones were automatically disconnected. Having no other way of contacting her, I went to her dentist in Mapo, Seoul. It was 3:30 p.m. on weekdays and his hospital door was closed. On the tightly closed door was a sign that said, We had closed our practice today. He knocked on the iron door recklessly, but there was no sign of it. As I waited for about 20 minutes to turn around, I wrote a note and opened the door, which had been closed heavily. After we had been talking for a while standing on the landing, he said, "" Let's go in and talk in the cold, "" and guided me into the hospital. In a few hours, he gave forth a quick stream of stories. An official interview with him was scheduled two days later. The story, which began at 4 p.m. on July 6, was long, and continued until 11 p.m., ordering Jajangmyeon. There was a notice from the entrance of the first floor of the building. "" applications for the 7:40 train, first come, first served "" Why do you start so early and close so early? "" The patients came too early and waited for me. She was here at 3 a.m. and someone was here at 2 a while ago. I have to pull it out as early as possible, but it's hard to start earlier because it's open at 7:40 a.m., and I say, "" Why don't you come in at 7:40 a.m. and have your order and your ticket for the first appointment? "" And I said, "" Why? Can I get an appointment by phone or the Internet? "" If I get a reservation right now, I will dump all my next three or four months in no time. Then you have to wait too long to see a doctor. I don't want to see many patients. Make it as uncomfortable and hard for you as possible, and you want to see only the patients who really need and need it. "" So why did you nail them down to 19? "" This is a multI-tested, trial-and-error timetable, with four people per person for 15 minutes, and 30 minutes for each person ... That's exactly 19 people by 3:15 p.m. Having four doctors and a 30-minute break can sometimes be prolonged looking at the patients in front, and if they're pushed around like that, they'll have to wait a lot. Then you can have your doctor's appointment at 3:30 or 4:00. "" Why close so early? Office workers can't come. "" I'm sorry, but I'm hungry.I haven't had lunch in nearly two years. These days, it's still a habit, so I do eat something off the go. You don't have time to go out and eat, but you can see behind it, right? "" And that's your lunchbox, right? "" No. O my! If the big one is a lunchbox ... would you like me to nose in?Do you see the plastic bag behind the bag? Have some bread or triangular gimbap prepared in advance. You can eat them on a whim. "" Director Kang Chang-yong of the Seoul Dental Clinic in Mapo-gu, Seoul, had an interview with < Hankyoreh > on July 6. When I took away the backpack, which was a reporter for senior reporter Kang Jae-hoon, I saw a small plastic bag with crumbs in it. In the past, patients stayed in the waiting room all day long and could not find time to drink or go to the bathroom, which led to the inflammation of the bladder. "" Now he's got the hang of it, "" a naughty boy smiled on his face as though he was admirable. Suddenly, he could see a desktop calendar in front of his desk. The date was marked with numbers and triangles such as ‘ 40 (7), 23 (5) … ’.What does this number mean? "" Oh, this is ... our dental bill.The numbers in brackets are the money you get from the patient, all in a card. The previous figure is the total import amount including insurance claims. "" So, today the patients paid me a total of 50,000 won and the insurance premium is 230,000? So you can stay in hospital? "" My standard price is 70 thousand won a day. That way, the hospital can stay with me, except for my regular spending. But the day when it doesn't work is ... Can you see the triangle? "" And on the December calendar, he showed almost every day with a triangle. The number of triangles on the calendar has increased since August, so it is now continued throughout the month. Since he began posting accusations of dental overdose on YouTube and Facebook, the deficit has only grown as more and more patients visit him.It's easy to be bullied, it's okay to go to the YouTube and file complaints about dental overdoses, right? I saw a video that was titled "" Dental Eye Contact Technique and Response Manual. "" "" I didn't know anything about Facebook or YouTube. When Facebook started, I didn't know the term Facebook.Who made me even when ‘Why don't you try a band’ ‘I can't sing.’ (laughter) (laughter) as SNS (sns) can ignorant man who, in June this year.From the video on YouTube and so learn to put an entire month if cases only a few decades and is viewed with Facebook so who's disappointed.Has to work together and told me. Facebook started around July. I'd report on my excess dental care on the TV program, Complaint Zero, in 2014, and I wouldn't believe anyone would tell me anything about it, no matter how I did. So I started to show you a dental photograph that I took of my teeth, and I started comparing them to it. "" So, I gave some dentists a list of patients who didn't even need dental treatment, or received dental support, and I gave them a list of patients who did. First, you should have your dental checkup at 2 or 3 different locations, get a medical certificate, compare it, and decide. So the media calls your dentist a conscience dentist or an outcast dentist. Do you agree with this expression? "" They are both right. That's the reality. The word "" conscience dentistry "" is not my creation. Dentists say, "" You're the only one with conscience?She swore, ' I'm here to talk to you about honesty and dental hygiene. ' ' Are you that good?As if ' Yes, I am proud 'You're also a bullying dentist. No wonder the dentists dislike me. Suppose someone overreached you with a small steel bar in the apartment building. Aren't the residents of that apartment building gon na do that? "" Hey, you're the one who drives down home. If you don't want to live, why go quietly and make a fuss? "" You should be conscientious in your treatment, why all the fuss about it? "" Well, isn't it hard to get criticized? `` We were almost through with seniors and juniors. There are many people who are duplicitous to comments, and there are people who are swearing at my parents. But you can't just sue me. Because the evidence is clear and I'm not saying the wrong thing. "" "" If I'm right about what I'm doing now, I'd better focus on it, "" he said. "" I'd like to accuse him of this guy and that guy, and then I'd suggest that he's going to go at it."
"It'll get cloudy. It wouldn't be a problem with overtherapy. It would be a battle between Kang and the dentists. "" So you don't use anything from the media or from patients to promote hospitals. One dentist in Gangnam said, "" I saw this as a honesty dentist on a promotional video. Restaurants put "" good restaurants "" signs at the door. "" I don't like it. I don't do anything disgraceful. I have to stay calm and focus on communicating the status of the excess care, so that I can spend my time promoting it personally and then do it for a long time? Since many patients still come to visit, I'm also asked to have a dentist's appointment with a "" joint. "" But when I make money here, I get blamed. I don't make money. "" So, is there another profit strategy that would make it worse for hospitals? "" … "" "" (Sigh) No. Anyway, my hospital is abnormal dental service. And the patients who usually come to me say, ' Do you do this prosthetic or what?' Should I tell her to implant?' Let's ask you something like this. I usually do a checkup and simple treatment. Otherwise, I can't see this many people a day. I have 19 visitors every day, but they are all neo-circulation. Usually, four to five patients in hospitals come to receive non-insurable treatment like neurotherapy, prosthetic implants, and so forth. That's how you make money. But I can't. Let's talk to the patients. This is not a dentist's office, this is a dental office.They say finding the wrong dental clinic is not something you can cure all of them. "" It's not a public institution, it's not a charity. "" I don't mind being ruined. I don't mind. Our dental clinic is like a sailing boat in a storm. If your dentist is doing well and you want to make a profit, you should never do it like this. They send everyone they want to ask for money to a different hospital without answering their phone calls. What the hell is this? I'm prepared to lose my job and talk about trying to solve this problem. "" Tears sprang up around his eyes. I didn't ask any more questions while he was trying to control his feelings.Disconnected, and the comments about the relation between older and younger alumni do was bad words to more patients to find eobyeongwon by hospital revenue day who can not fill a month needed to maintain Plenty, Moon Jae-in.To initiate care, the excessive medical care from jungyoam need manual can do if you put your mind to it in dental treatment like surgery patients, "" as you about tooth decay.Don't know?? become so absorbed in the overtreatment problem of the dentist when ― Do you have any special occasion? When I first opened, I don`t know anything either. I opened it in 2006 with two employees, and I work hard, but my sales are not good. Other dentists sell 10 golden teeth a day, but I recommend two to three inlays a week. ' Ah, the real corridor is terrible. Why in the world do people in this town have such good teeth? Is there a bad place to visit in the hospital?' I thought.Finally, I decided to close the hospital in June 2011, and I sent out all my employees. I'm doing a one-man dentistry exercise for a while to get a hospital, and I thought I'd figure out what the problem was with that few months. If I open my practice again, I need to know what I did wrong. "" But it turned out to be the doctors ' office. "" One day, a woman came to see a doctor who said she had had braces for the last two years and had been told that she had been in the hospital for three or four months and hadn't had any problems. But when I went to a dentist's office, he told me I had to have all ten cavities filled. When I checked it, it was clean. No, I would have gone to the dentist once a month to have my dental cavity filled for two years. It doesn't make any sense. So, uh, where do I report this?' I called in an email at MBC and told my friend, ' Discontent Zero. ' We covered it and showed that each dentist had to pay five million won or more to examine and treat the same patient. And when I did that, I was told by the dental service, "" Oh, this is a serious problem. I thought I'd fix it. "" "" Hmm. "" But didn't I? "" There were many such patients. And there were places where they couldn't find a single tooth decay, where they had four golden teeth glued to perfectly different healthy molars, and six months ago, they had 10 bad teeth taken out by dental clinics. But when I told her that way, even my best friend would say, ' That's because the patient is the truth. You're overstepping. "" The dental association and the dental paper also criticized me. Care is subjective and can vary from doctor to doctor. I call it a problem of over-care, and under-care. "" And he said, "" You know, you know, you know, I recommend conservative care, but I don't think it's too much of anyone with expertise to do anything with it. Wouldn't it be possible for doctors to make different judgments about the timing and scope of treatment? Let's look at cancer patients. And when you get to the tumor size, doctors are going to figure out how to get it out of the way. Sometimes I just watch without doing any surgery when I have a one-centimeter tumor. With another treatment in preference Is it because the tumor is small and it will grow anyway? Watch and don't want the stomach to be more open and closed than remove the tumor. Same thing with dentistry. When people call a cavity treatment, they know they're going to get rid of it and cover it up, but they have to dig it several times more than when they want to get prosthetic material in. "" Oh, I see. I misunderstood that the expression "" cover something "" sounds like a shield, like an armor, without the original tooth. "" When it comes to gold, we usually do neurotheral therapy, and that is actually removing and not curing it. If you remove nerves, they don't provide good nutrients to your teeth, so they can shorten their lifespan, like a black tree. "" But isn't it less painful to treat before they decay? "" Even adults in their 20s and older have slow dental decay. A male patient in his 60s showed up and another hospital asked him to do four gold teeth. She had a cavity for 30 to 40 years, but it only decayed so far. You don't have to wait another 50 years for it to decay. Besides, her gums are bad. ' Grandpa, even if it is gold, you will have to take it off first because of your gums. Don't worry about cavities and take good care of your gums. ' "" So why is it that doctors are involved in this? "" Dental treatment requires a consistent manual, like cancer surgery. If you have cavities like this, you can make a criterion of damage to the enamel, based on what's called a cut. I've made my own. If you put your mind to it, you can make it in dentistry. But why can't I make it? You have no will. Treatment for dental decay should not be subjective. We can have bad feelings because we have to make money in a capitalist society. Some dentists openly advertise that they fix skin diseases, infertility problems, and stroke problems, "" said Director Kang Chang-yong of the Seoul Dental Office in Seoul. The hospital's finances are deteriorating due to examination and simple treatment. Why not give up? So, something has to be done to restore trust between doctors and patients. "" ‘Moon Jae-in care’ To be stop overtreatment, even more important. Moon Jae-in levy is less of it to ‘do you do this, even that.’ dental care and himself are to be more. Now, the patient pays 300,000 won by the end of the day because they say, "" If you don't, it will be a big problem. "" If you don't get over the doctor's appointment, you're going to give the cat fish. There are some things that patients haven't been able to do because of the price resistance, but the dentist could make a fortune if he or she chooses to practice overtherapeuting. Sometimes it's not like you're going to the dental health, but rather than go to the dental clinic. "" What about a solution? Until when can you do that? "" We need to add dental specialists to the clinic. It doesn't cost much. Are you going to die because you have to hire two or three dentists for each health center in our budget? You can't stop the treatment from 100 percent, but if you have a non-profit -- a health center -- a dental clinic -- that checks and diagnoses you according to the manual for your public health -- you're playing the role of public health service providers. "" Can we add more doctor-attached dentists? "" There are many different kinds of dentists. Some doctors would be willing to sign up as contract workers for childcare. Some doctors are in their 60s and older and difficult to work at regular dental clinics. They could set a working day and make it a contract. It's a good opportunity for doctors. "" Now, you've been raising this issue for the past four or five years, and you've become an outcast rather than getting encouragement or support from dentists. What is the most hurtful thing you've ever heard? "" You can call me shit. There was a comment that said, "" The poop gets tangled. "" I'm the shit, and the patients who find me are the scum. Well, that's okay. The words on my chest ... I said to my patients, "" You have no money. "" (Screaming) Oh, I actually read them and I cried in the nursery. It's okay to treat me like shit. But when I call my patient a "" beggar, "" I get a fever. I don't know how big and scary it is. And people who say that, they judge patients by their money. Is it a sin to have no money? How do I make a man out of money? "" He burst out crying as if he couldn't stand it any more. He still has the bitterness of the days when he was treated as a ' beggar. ' "" When I was homeless and starved for food, "" he knows, "" the cold, cold reception and social contempt can be a bitter pain for the ' the poor '.

So far, he has not forgotten the lesson of life that poverty is not a sin but a pain that our society will embrace.You've come all the way here after all the hard work, but didn't you think you wanted to make a living off the fat? "" I wanted to be a doctor because I wanted to be like Dr. Chang Ki-ryeo. If I had a lot of food, a lot of money to live and lose, would I have done this now? I'm sure you must be busy traveling abroad with money. If you have God, I may have given you a lot of hard times to do this right now. "" Why not be criticized, not given the money, not the one who doesn't? "" (Eye round) You're wrong! Call it wrong, and you say, why not give up?Is ' ' neun ' correct? I saw something wrong. I'm not trying to fix it, I'm just saying it's wrong and you give it up? Where are we going to give up? "" And people say, "" Oh, that's a good idea. ' You're right, but you can't change it alone. Don't go out alone. ' "" It's a battle of confidence. My greed is thinking I'm going to change everything about the treatment I overreach in a short time. To the best of my ability, I will go. Then someone will start over there again. After thinking about it, I felt better. Would the world be so fortunate? I don't know … I'm going to keep doing this whether I can or not. I won't give up.

Once broken, the bond between the molecules that make up the material is severed, and it is difficult to reuse glass without melting at higher temperatures. NHK and the Asahi Shimbun reported yesterday that a team of Japanese scientists at Tokyo University discovered the original science paper "" Aida Takujo "" on July 14. While studying the new adhesive, the team discovered by accident that the hard, crispy tactile material had self-restoring features that would automatically return to its original state. When the material, a translucent new material called the Polietertio element, was created, it was confirmed that it would stick together for decades after breaking. It was shown to recover its original strength when the cross sections were held together for 1-6 hours at room temperature. Materials that can be self-restorable after breaking down at room temperature are found in soft materials, such as rubber, but are said to be hard to achieve in hard materials like glass. We were skeptical when we first found them, said Yanagisawa, a researcher for the team.

United News TV : Technology & Line Jebo 23 I don`t think income driven growth is the opposite of a fall-down effect, said Kim Sang-jo, head of the Fair Trade Commission. Kim said in a year-end news conference held in Sejong City on July 14, "" The top - down track of the effect and income - led growth of the Korean society are all about to make a cycle of structure. "" Pillar of Moon Jae-in government economic policy framework are driven by income growth. It is a growth strategy centered on the domestic market that encourages consumption and investment by allowing companies to pass their late income to households through wage hikes. The increase in income levels by corporate and upper-income households through tax cuts was in contrast to the previous conservative government`s economic policies focusing on the so-called "" drain effect "" on households in the low-income bracket, which led to increased consumption and investment. Even academics have been at the center of criticism that it is either "" heresy "" or "" fake, "" which has not been proven economically. But Kim stressed that the role of the commission in the new administration is to make the past drain on the economy. He said, When the Korean economy grew at a high rate over the last 30 years, the growth mistakes of a small number of conglomerates could spread quickly, albeit in a preferential economy. The so-called fall effect has worked well, the rating said, "" The reason why the Korean economy is experiencing a low-growth, bi-polarization is because it has lost its connection. "" The reason the ring is broken is because the playgrounds are not level, Kim said, playing the role of creating a flat, rotating playground with two tracks : the drain effect and income driven growth. In other words, it is the commission's duty to let the income enjoyed by conglomerates and their workers flow down to sub-contractors and sub-contractors. As such, the "" fractional effect "" - income growth emphasizes the downward trend of spending, corporate investment and domestic demand growth. In the end, he argues, the two policies can be circulated without confrontation. The key policy tool to normalize the drain effect was to eliminate the quality of canned food. Among the tasks the commission has to do, it is to root out chaebol reform and blood quality, I believe, in fact, the basic principle of economic democratization is to root out corruption. "" Getting rid of the substance of the past is directly related to people's lives as a task to make our society even, "" Kim said. `` I know, but I can not overcome the cynicism about what chaebol reform can do about my life. To be sure it is connected to my life, we need to eliminate the blood from the deck first. He said, We announced two of the measures to eradicate the inferior quality of the four areas, including member, agency, distribution and sub-contracting, and will come up with sub-contractory measures within the first half of next year, and the four will be established. At the opening speech session in the National Assembly Library, Chairman Kim stressed yesterday that, "" As we will intensify the distribution of achievements resulting from unfair trade due to an imbalance in the power of small and mid-sized enterprises, we will again emphasize the polarization of our economy.

Kwon Soon-ho, justice of the Seoul Central District Court who issued the warrant for Woo's arrest, said, We are under fire for destroying evidence related to the inspection of special inspectors. The legal circle calls for taking note of the fact that Kwon referred to the temple of the special inspector before Lee Seok-soo, among other charges. Allegations that Woo interrupted former special prosecutors investigating alleged irregularities of his personal feelings are already in the arrest warrant requested by special prosecutor Park Young-soo and special prosecutor's office in April. At the time, the court refused to issue a warrant to investigate and Woo was indicted without physical detention on charges of violating the law. However, the investigation team of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office (Team Captain Park Chan-ho, 2nd Deputy Chief Prosecutor) newly discovered that Woo used the NIS to investigate Lee's background. They secured documents of the NIS ' inspection and received orders from Choo Myung-ho, former director of the NIS ' national security affairs bureau. In other words, he blocked the retreat so that he could not deny the fact. Former Chief of Staff Woo insisted on July 14 in questioning suspects before their arrest (prosecutors ' investigation of the warrant) that his charges were not illegal. Lee, former vice minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism Park Min-kwon, former chairman of Woori Bank and former chairman of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics organizing committee Kim Jin-seon acknowledged that they had ordered prosecutors to investigate the case. The court, however, apparently judged that the inspection order for Lee, among others, was not for public purposes but for covering up his displeasure. They say that they abused the authority of the Senior Secretary for Civil Affairs with a conscience. In addition, the court could have destroyed the evidence by making sure that Woo was not detained, as the former chief of the special counsel investigation was justified. banghd@yna.co.kr and inquiry (click!) ▶ Collecting the latest trends (click!)"
"Lee Dong-Woo, a reporter at Money-Dong Museum in Seoul A man in his thirties, who did not know, punched him for no reason. As he could not stay from being beaten, he fell together when he caught Mr. B by the collar.Eventually, the two went to the police station. Although he had an operation for a fractured nose and was diagnosed with a 6-week treatment, he did not receive a medical certificate due to a light abrasion. However, the police concluded that the attack was both sides of the street. Last year, a woman in her 20s who drank with an acquaintance at a bar got into a fight with her companion. When a man in his 20s used violence, Mr. C slapped the man on the face. Afterwards, he received several blows to the face and legs and was questioned by the police. In fact, despite being attacked unilaterally, he or she was not allowed to defend herself and was questioned on suspicion of violence on both sides before finally agreeing. These are the cases in which lawyers sought legal advice from online legal advice services. As such, it is very difficult to be approved as a self-defense in our country. Even if you get into a fight during the holiday drinking spree, you are familiar with the phrase, "" Don't hit me when I get hit. "" Many times it is called "" bilateral violence "" rather than self-defense. Critics point out that the reality that makes it hard to deal with threats should be changed.A case in point is the theft, brain death, that provoked controversy over self-defense. In March 2014, a 22-year-old owner allegedly hit a thief who broke into his home with an aluminum washer-and-dryer. Kim went brain-dead and died the same year. Choi insisted on self-defense, but the court rejected it and sentenced him to three years in jail in June and one year in jail for manslaughter.The incident served as a turning point for the nation's troubled self-defense measures. Members of the National Assembly's Legislation and Judiciary Committee in 2014 also criticized the decision to ask the criminals whether to bring deadly weapons, steal things or just run away. Police used the incident to set up a guideline for investigating violent cases in April of the same year, setting up a standard for self-defense. Instructions are provided to prevent or provoke a person's defense against an act of inferring a person, and to avoid an act of self-defense, etc. The act of violating the person's personal protection against a person is not more important than the act of violating the person's right.In 2015, self-defense was decided with the exception of two requirements, not to use an accessory weapon or a dangerous object, and to avoid injury that would require long-term care.Although the number of cases of self-defense has increased since then, the portion of cases of violent attacks is still small. As of the end of October 2014, there were 970 cases in which the guidelines were given, 1286 cases in year 2015, 2502 cases in 2016, and 2486 cases in year 2001, were recognized as self-defense. Considering that last year, the number of violent attacks occurred 168,503, and that a considerable number of these cases were committed by both sides, it is still difficult to be recognized as self-defense. The reason why self-defense requirements are difficult is due to the ambiguity of standards. According to criminal law, self-defense is a standard for preventing "" reasonable reasons "" and "" reasonable reasons "" when acts to defend an unjust violation are currently justified.The court case reveals the fact that it is hard to distinguish self-defense. The 2010 Supreme Court case says "" it is usually hard to justify an act that is seen as "" only two sides of the line "", "" an act of aggression and defense is carried out one after another and the act of defense is both at the same time attacked "".We can not make a simple comparison because not only bilateral but unilateral assault is included in the case, a police official said.Under these circumstances, many say that the government should set detailed defense requirements. They say that the government should set the standard with a social consensus and apply it to the actual scene to prevent unfair citizens from forming.

The reporters who served as Trudeau had to go through a ' unpleasant ' experience with the security guards who seemed to be under the direction of Chinese security. When Prime Minister Trudo entered the People's Assembly Hall with Chinese Prime Minister Li Kechang on May 4, Chinese security guards blocked the photograph. Security guards also interfered with photography by becoming photographers and the prime minister, and even preventing Trudeau's exclusive photographer Adam Scotti from entering the conference hall. Eventually, the Canadian media could not take proper pictures at the scene. The Canadian National Post reported that during Trudo's visit, many of them were offended.

The White House protocol team and the secret service (SS) employees who arrived before the summit between the U.S. and America were also locked up at a security checkpoint and were asked how many Americans were to leave for the summit. The violence, which ended in a mere argument with Canada and the United States, was not a major problem, but ended in a mass assault on the Korean media, causing public sentiment in Korea and other foreign media to protest. The day before yesterday, China Foreign Press Association (FCCC) said, We received several reports of Chinese reporters being assaulted during this year`s coverage. Violence against journalists is totally unacceptable, said a statement calling for the truth behind the incident.

The Seoul Central District Public Prosecutors ` Office and special prosecutors, which have been holding court for the past 25 years, repeatedly made their decision on Dec. 14 to hold court hearings on the same day. Considering the nature of the crime, the size of the crime, the size of the crime, and the sheer volume of victims and social harm, it was said that the biggest problem was the difficulty of finding an example to compare. The options were minimum 10 years in jail to a life sentence. Under the law, a person charged with aggravated punishment of certain crimes is liable to weapons or jail term of more than 10 years if he or she receives more than 100 million won in bribes. The offenders who have misused their rights are sentenced to less than five years in jail, a suspended jail term of less than 10 years or fines of less than 10 million won. We also took into consideration the criteria set by the Supreme Court's penalty committee, an official said. According to this standard, if the amount of the money collected is more than 500 million won, it is recommended to be sentenced to 7 to 10 years in jail if there is an alarm and 11 years in jail if the punishment is aggravated. The basic sentence of sentence is 9-12 years in jail. Choi was also charged with breaking the law, hiding criminal profits, forcing him to do so and attempting to cheat.

"Net Neutrality ' Support ' in the U.S. Discarded by Government Policy "" Korean Policy No Change "" and "" Telecommunication between Telecommunication service providers - Platform operators … "" (Official News = Associated Press : Im Hwa-seop,) changed major ICT environments from advanced. The decision, made by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission on July 14 (local time), does not immediately lead to a substantial change in Internet communications in and out of the U.S. However, as U.S. telecom companies move away from stringent network-neutrality pre-regulation measures, the world is watching for changes in the global information and communication technology (ICT) environment in the long term. Once U.S. telcos - direct beneficiaries, Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T ; appear to be at a disadvantage to new content providers (CP) who seek to innovate on the market. Large existing CP companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Netflix and Microsoft, which are already in the market, could benefit from a little.◇ Does the basic Internet mind change?…Network-net networthiness refers to the Internet service provider (ISP), or the carrier that provides the same amount of data traffic to the Internet. ISPs should in principle treat the traffic received by network users as equals and some should be treated discriminatively by blocking, delaying, limiting speed or giving priority. These regulatory philosophies have long been in place and the United States FCC has built on them since the early 2000s. As the Internet spread widely from the US, not only the U.S. but other major industrialized nations had different legal forms and details, but also controlled based on such principles. In the U.S., however, there was no firm legal basis for neutrality, so the courts had to stop running them on several occasions. That is why the FCC legalized its network-neutrality principle by setting up an Open Internet Rule in 2015 under the Obama administration, but the Trump Administration voted on its abolition on Monday. Accordingly, U.S. service providers are able to quickly send Internet traffic from a particular CP and receive a reward, or ' use that traffic to adjust the contents of that CP slowly ', or use it to consumers as a selective service. The carrier's own content business could also benefit from traffic management. However, some point out that it is not very likely that there will be outright discrimination by explicit users or enforcement of unfair transactions because there are ex post facto regulations by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that address the problem of fair trade.Network Nearability Image[Wikimedia Supply] ◇ U.S. telecom companies, such as Verizon and Comcast, whose deregulation of networks was at the core of the U.S. : Comcast, Verizon and AT&T ; The Open Internet Rules, established in 2015, were designed to classify ISPs as publicly-public services, such as electric, water, and wired phones, but the service providers claim it was excessive regulations. The reason for net neutrality of the card administration is that it reduces regulations on the Internet and encourages telecom companies to make network investments including 5G. However, Internet related businesses, except communication companies, showed great concern and raised their voice to object. Neutrality regulations on ISPs have served as the soil for ' disruptive innovations ' in the Internet and mobile sectors, and when weakened, it is feared that new business models will be difficult to emerge and spread in the ICT sector. However, some large CP companies that are already firmly established in the content market may have a slightly different stance. Some point out that if the net-network disposal fails to find a new CP project, the existing large CP companies with high bargaining power could benefit from the transaction. Technology giant Google, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, Facebook and Amazon officially announced before the vote that they wanted to maintain neutrality, but some say they will not file suit, and others say they will go on legal motions.U.S. FCC Chairman Agit Fie answers a question from a reporter at the FCC building in Washington, D.C., after the FCC decided on the abolition of neutrality on December 14, 2017. (AP Photo / Jacquelyn Martin) [AP = Yonhap news] ◇ U.S. Information and Communication Ministry "" different from there…""Network…Network-neutrality Policy Fundamentals "" These U.S. policy changes do not directly affect Korea and the U.S. That is because the legal grounds and market conditions are totally different. Song Jae-seong, director of the Communication Competition Policy Division at the Ministry of Science and Technology and Communication, said before the U.S. FCC vote on July 14, It is premature to see U.S. policy changes as a global trend, explaining that Korea`s telecommunications policies will not change. "" I do not intend to change domestic guidelines (established on the principle of neutrality) immediately, and the European Union (EU), which is also not willing to change its policies, was not willing to budge. "" Unlike the United States, In Korea, not stuck in the law as a mobile network operators and the isp gyuje the net on the basis of regulations and guidelines had already been made, and Moon Jae-in.President also pledged to establish network neutrality principles in his campaign promises. Kim Min-ho, a law professor at Sungkyunkwan University, criticized, "" Neutrality is the basic spirit and ideology of the Internet, and it is a very wrong decision to abandon it in the United States. "" Unlike the United States, Korea`s three telecom companies have been formed under the government initiative, he stressed, Considering the historical background, the nation should remain neutral. The European Union has also shown little response to the U.S.'s moves to scrap its network-neutrality system. The EU and its member countries have been enforcing regulations based on the basic principles of network-neutrality since the early 2000s and have established guidelines for networthiness that apply to the entire EU the year before.◇ Korean telecom companies ' innermost expectations = Korean Internet companies are concerned, but Korean telecom companies hope that the U.S. decision to scrap the networks to change Korea's communication policies. With massive investment needed in 5G networks over the next few years, the government is under pressure to reduce prices, and is hopeful that new opportunities will be opened by easing regulations on neutrality. A telecom official said Korea needs to closely examine the decision of the United States, adding, As the networks get more sophisticated, there is discrimination that they need to provide a quicker or more reliable network for each service sector. The concept of networthiness itself is something that contents operators see from their point of view, he argued, so far, network operators have little room to operate and have little incentive to invest. However, the communication companies are not actively expressing their hopes. It is not very feasible at the moment and could face backlash from the public. Internet companies other than the telecom giant expressed concern over the possibility that the United States ` decision to scrap its network-neutralized networks could affect Korean telecommunications policies. If it does not seem to have a big impact right now, but it could have bad effects in the long run, said Cha Jae-pil, director of the policy bureau at the Internet giant Internet Business Association. That would mean big businesses could afford and develop other services, but startup and small and midsize businesses can not afford to pay network fees, which would discourage them from innovation, he added. solatido@yna.co.kr"
"[Hankyoreh] Question 3 : Is Bitcone Fever soaring 16 times this year?Since there is no fair price to describe "" bubble theory, "" can it be an alternative currency that can soar or fall 10 times a day?With the financial crisis causing distrust, is the future open to skepticism?While it is hard to jump to conclusions about the various views of countries that do not recognize the government line and financial instruments, the virtual currency market in front of Bit-seop, Jung-gu, Seoul, is held yesterday afternoon. Park Jong-sik, journalist of Nakamoto SatoshI, published his first paper on Bitcone (a document on the e-money of bit coins) in October 2008. For many years afterwards, Bitcone was so insignificant that it could not even reach the sound of background noise in the vast financial market. But now, Bitcone is gaining "" citizenship "" in global finance, causing major governments and the central bank to agonize over the basic question of what is finance or money. ※ You can view the graphic larger than the other options. ■ Although the bubble burst, Bitcone received great attention this year because of its price hikes, which was not seen in the past. This year alone, it has increased 16 times. Foreign media point to the rise in the price of Bitcone as a "" rocket soaring into the sky. "" No financial asset has seen its price surge since the 20th century to match the Bitcone. Financial experts are naturally spouting the word "" bubble. "" In a recent survey of the Bitcone craze conducted by the Wall Street Journal > (WSJ), 51 out of 53 respondents said it was "" bubble. "" In general, the bubble has the belief that the product has the right price to reflect its actual value. When the price of a product goes up more than the right price, I think it's bubble. Proper prices are estimated based on the premise that the product is connected to an economic fundamentals. Shares in Samsung Electronics are connected to the company`s earnings outlook or the company`s industrial outlook. Analysts ` job is to estimate the appropriate price of securities or financial instruments such as bonds. However, since Bitcone is not linked to any economic fundamentals, it is difficult to estimate the appropriate price using the existing method. Therefore, some people say that the expression "" bubble "" is inappropriate. That is why the Bitcone market has grown to $ 280 billion (as of July 14, or about 305 trillion won), but has not yet been analyzed for Bitcone. Bitcone prices are unpredictable. We may continue to soar or even collapse to zero. Psychologists and sociologists who analyze single-minded people's behavior are more suitable for bit-coins analysts. ※ You can view the graphic larger than the other options. ■ It is based on the government's ` distrust ` of the ` legal currency ` in which the central bank guarantees value and issues. As the central banks of each country poured out their currencies to overcome the financial crisis, doubts grew as to whether their values could be maintained. The government, central bank and financial district that failed to manage the crisis were also the drivers of the birth of Bitcone. Nakamoto's paper was also published right after the financial crisis. Many experts are skeptical that Bitchin will be able to obtain the status of an alternative currency that can replace the coin in court. Most importantly, the big price volatility that has resulted from not being able to estimate the fair value is weakness. If the price set for the same object is so sharp that it would make a half-bit or two-bit coin (BTC) overnight, would it be possible to function as a coin? There are also concerns that the negative aspects of the overall economic activity are large. With the volume set at 21 million, it could turn into a "" solitary poison "" for an economy that needs a steady supply of money. In a report released at the end of October, the Chicago Board of Trade (CME) said, Any person who has money (limited to a supply) will save rather than spend it. If this occurs, it will cause economic stagnation and financial instability. Bitcone, which is not in circulation and tends to be locked, could add to the economic difficulties. ■ Future? These worries have affected the Korean government's not to judge all virtual currencies such as BitTone as Bitcons as as its financial products. Ironically, this judgment led the government to come up with various regulations to control the market from overheating, but did not mobilize as many of the most effective financial regulations as it did on July 13. The application of financial regulations means attracting virtual currencies and their markets into the drawing system. However, it is premature to conclude that the future of Bitcone will remain only outside the drafting rights. Bitcone is a mere 8 years old who is born with a difficult time to assess. Countries around the world view virtual currencies as a currency or financial instruments and prohibit transactions themselves because they can not say the future of Bitcone. Currently, they are subject to speculation, but a virtual currency ecosystem can be established at any moment to serve as a payment method. In the United States, for example, the permitted child center (the act of funding with an ICO·Virtual currency) demonstrates the possibility of a virtual currency as a new source of capital. When the government expressed its will to take a stand on Bitcone, Chairman Jay Clayton, the Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), announced a clear, multI-directional call to discuss virtual market participants.

"- Decide on the impact of tax hikes to be paid - planned to add factories to make hitch - investment of 460 billion won and job creation of 700 workers - The price competitiveness of cigarettes has become more effective in the domestic market. Since individual excise taxes were raised last month, cigarette makers have been burdened with higher costs before a rise in excise duties, local education and the burden of raising public health. Eventually, Philip Morris set out to raise the price of Hitz, an ice stick. Late runners like British American Tobacco Korea (BAT Korea) are also set to decide whether or not to raise their earnings after watching the market and the economy. Philip Morris will raise Hitz's consumer price to 4,500 won from the current 4300 won per pack starting July 20. Philip Morris submitted a bill to the Strategy and Finance Ministry that changed the price of cigarettes. The price hike is due to the individual excise tax on cigarette electronic cigarettes already being raised starting Nov. 16, with additional tax on tobacco consumption, local education and the national health benefits.Chairman Chung Il-woo of Philip Morris Corporation in Korea, after a comprehensive review by the Congress and the government to ensure that the tax hikes do not go into the people's debt, that the company finally decided to minimize the possibility of cigarette conversion to cigarettes.Philip Morris will also decide to build an extension of the current mass production plant to produce hitch in Korea, creating Asia's first product base. Hitz's domestic production is expected to support its price competitiveness by reducing the cost of imports and other duties. To that end, Philip Morris decided to finalize a large-scale investment plan that will hire a total of 420 million dollars (460 billion won) by 2019 and add 700 people to the list. Chairman Chung Il-woo said, "" Hitz's domestic product could greatly contribute to creating jobs, not only the local economy by boosting investment, but also the government's key administrative tasks. ""attom@heraldcorp.com Lee Ki-beom, former presidential secretary for civil affairs Woo Byung-woo, was finally arrested on July 15. It is estimated that the recent failure of arrest by key suspects to clear up the corruption scandals caused the rebound.Until recently, the investigation by the NIS investigation team of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors ' Office (Team Captain Park Chan-ho) seemed to be losing steam due to unexpected obstacles. A typical investigation on the Duke of comments left by the Lee Myung-bak administration the cyber command. The prosecution was former Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin and gimtaeyo former Cheong Wa Dae, Lee Myung-bak took custody of the strategic plan aimed at the former president tried. But the plan was hampered by Kim`s release through the court's appeal to the enemy and his arrest warrant for Kim. The NIS's widespread involvement in political activities, including its use of civilian comment units and its campaign against critics in the political, cultural and entertainment sectors, was also in trouble. One key official, Won SeI-hoon, former head of the NIS, reportedly denied all accusations and refused to cooperate with the investigation, and was unable to speed up the investigation. Other obstacles were found outside of the investigation. After a series of releases and arrest warrants by key suspects, some in and outside the legal profession criticized the prosecution for asking for a warrant to arrest them under the influence of the prosecution. Others say that the fact that Prosecutor General Moon Moo-il said that he would complete the major investigation by the end of the year caused a huge burden on the team. Analysts say that the prosecution's success in arresting Woo is symbolic. The special prosecutors ` team and the prosecution's special investigation office sought arrest warrants twice for Woo in February and April, but all were dismissed. The prosecution is trying to arrest a top power figure who has violated the principles of the Constitution this time. The issue is crucial and there is a high possibility of evidence destruction, Lee said, confident of the arrest and achieved a result. It is true that there have been critical views on the investigation so far, said a lawyer close to the prosecution, adding, The arrest of Woo has relieved the prosecution of its worries. It is very meaningful that we can silence negative public opinions, such as excessive investigations, and restore momentum throughout the related investigations that have been rather sluggish in recent years.

In particular, statements to the effect is ""Park Geun-hye, former president by the temple."" in the U, a former senior prosecutors ' probe reportedly, the prosecution's investigation into Park, the former president.Also likely to lead. U Park is a former senior president had pointed to the temple with Chairman Kim to munchebu officials reported to have to. If such suspicions are proved, Park of former president is more likely to be added. Meanwhile, the prosecution is set to summon Woo for questioning over the weekend for questioning.

"Walt first love as news entrepreneur ... Disney's acquisition of stakes is also in Gain Bloomberg, a Murdoch asset that will grow by $ 4 billion with M&A ; the media and entertainment giant who has been married to the media and media giant.Rupert Murdoch [AFP = The Associated Press] was at the back of the merger and acquisition (M&A ;) on July 15 when Murdoch's intention to re-enact the past's "" news empire "" was hidden and expand his influence in the entertainment arena with the acquisition of Disney's shares. As is well known, Murdoch, who ruled as the world's largest media tycoon with News Corporation, expanded his business scope to entertainment in 1985 by taking over 20th century Fox, a famous American film company. After Murdoch's acquisition, Fox created the film industry's dominant presence in the world by producing outstanding hits such as "" Titanic, "" "" Avatar, "" "" Star Wars, "" and "" X-Men. "" It also hit the big time on TV with "" The Simpsons, "" "" X-Files "" and "" American Idol. "" CNN Money has interpreted that Murdoch's decision to hand over to Disney such a thriving entertainment business represented a U-turn with his "" first love "" news business.Disney, the friends of the composite photo company, Murdock, said in unison, "" His interest in FOX News and the newspapers has always focused more on the entertainment business. "" They said Murdoch always loved to be a gossip, and wanted to reach his political and business goals with these news platforms. Murdoch's editor-in-chief Andrew Neal is at Fox News ' British Sky TV acquisition hearing, where he says, "" Murdoch's blood vessels carry ink. "" And "" He is happiest when he's spending time with reporters on evidence. "" Various interpretations are also being made of Murdoch's choice of Disney over outstanding contenders such as Comcast and Verizon. CNBC Broadcasting says the M&A was accomplished because Disney's acquisition of Fox matched Murdoch's interests exactly, and Disney's proposed exactly what Murdoch wanted. Murdoch's decision to own 5 percent of Disney's shares rather than Comcast and Verizon contributed to the acquisition. "" Who would refuse to own Disney's shares, "" explained Rich Greenfield, media analyst at BTIG, "" Disney has the biggest studio in the world. "" Some also predict that Murdoch's son, James Murdoch, will seek the next Disney CEO to take office after his term until 2021.Disney CEOs Eiger and Murdoch [Yonhap news release photo], along with the Justice Department's possible "" vertical "" merger, AT&T ; and a time-out for Time Warner could put Fox in the hands of Comcast or Verizon. Meanwhile, some expect that Murdoch's fortune will grow to $ 4 billion (4.2 trillion won) due to the completion of the M&A project. Murdoch's assets, which were worth $ 11 billion (12 trillion won) earlier this month when the news broke that Disney was seeking to acquire Fox in the 21st century, rose to more than $ 2 billion (2.1 trillion won) in wealth, according to Bloomberg. Murdoch's wealth, now scaled to $ 138 billion (15.5 trillion won), is forecast to grow by another $ 2 billion when the merger is finished. "" Murdoch will become richer in the long run, "" Bloomberg said, "" he will rapidly increase himself by taking over Disney's stake in a stronger company besides Fox assets.
